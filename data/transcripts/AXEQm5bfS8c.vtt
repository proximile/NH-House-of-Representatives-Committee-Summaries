and he oversaw was the in charge on this
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
on this audit
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
and so i've asked him to present
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
um the report
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
much like we did for the fiscal
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee so steve

you madam chair for uh having us
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
for the record i am steve grady the
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
in-charge auditor for the division of
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%

00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
the audit was designed to determine how
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively the division
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
operated during state fiscal years 2018
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and 2019.
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
due to the report's length i will be
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
summarizing observations and chapters
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
our executive summary captures main
 
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
themes and the most significant concerns
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
it is there that we conclude the
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
commission lacked adequate management
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
controls to ensure the division achieved
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
expected outcomes
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
our recommendation summary follows
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
our recommendations typically focus on
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%

properly implemented monitored and
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%

some controls and corresponding actions
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
were unauditable because they were

poorly documented and relevant records
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
were unreliable
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
we were compelled to qualify our use of

management control deficiencies
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
we evaluated 21 relevant observations
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
from seven prior audits and found one
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
was fully resolved

we repeated 20 prior observations in

this report
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
some topics were previously addressed as

initially identified as far back as 1989
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
here we suggest the legislature consider
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
increasing its oversight of commission
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
compliance with laws and rules was a
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
basic expectation
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
but management lacked controls to ensure
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
the statutory framework was optimized
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
statutes were complex and commission
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
rules amplified statutory complexity
 
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
to fill in gaps within the statutory and
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework the division
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
undertook broad ad-hoc rulemaking some

knowingly some unknowingly
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
ad hoc rulemaking is an extra legal
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
practice of enforcing requirements on
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
however knowledge management practices
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
were inadequate controls were fragmented
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
and improvised practices produced
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
inaccurate incomplete and unreliable

chapter 2 addresses licensing
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
we found licensing controls lacked a
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
discernible design and were reliant upon
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
ad hoc rules
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
practices were inconsistent with statute
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
rules and sops
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
licensing was complex to the point where
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
a pre-application form and process had
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
to be used before an applicant should
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
begin the actual license application
 
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.750 align:start position:0%
begin the actual license application
process

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
simplifying licensing has received
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
attention in the past but that objective
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
was unrealized while there were over 100
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
licensed types and subtypes they all fit
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
into three basic categories
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
our recommendations here include the
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
commission seeking risk-based licensing
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
reforms to simplify the licensing
 
00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
reforms to simplify the licensing
framework

00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
chapter three addresses the direct
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
shipper program
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
the program was created to enable
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
citizens and licensees to buy hard to
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
find alcoholic beverages from
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
out-of-state suppliers
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
but the program's controls lacked a
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
discernible design
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
the program's statutory purpose was
 
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.189 align:start position:0%
the program's statutory purpose was
exceeded

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
exceeded
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
statutory non-compliance was
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
long-standing ad hoc rulemaking was
 
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.910 align:start position:0%
long-standing ad hoc rulemaking was
common

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
common
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
rules were inconsistently followed and
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
prior audit findings were unresolved
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
the division inconsistently enforced
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
compliance and sanctioned non-compliance
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately the commission did not know
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
what was being directly shipped into the
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
state or whether the correct amount of
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
taxes and fees were received
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%

function
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
we found examination processes lacked a
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
discernible design
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
the division could not demonstrate

the division could not demonstrate
expected

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
expected
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
related outcomes were achieved with 92
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
percent of licensees not receiving an

period

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
rules and sops were inadequate
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
practices were reliant upon broad ad-hoc
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and were non-compliant with
 
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.509 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and were non-compliant with
statute

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
examination processes were known to rely

chapter 5 addresses enforcement
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
we found controls to ensure licensee
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
compliance with laws and rules were
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
inadequate and lacked a discernible
 
00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.990 align:start position:0%
inadequate and lacked a discernible
design

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
prior audit findings were not addressed
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
and long-standing deficiencies and waste
 
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.829 align:start position:0%
and long-standing deficiencies and waste
persisted

00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
persisted
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
some enforcement activities were
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
unrelated to a licensee or permittee or
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
were without connection to statutes for
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
which the commission was responsible
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
this scope creep was a long-standing
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
unresolved concern
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
scope creep was not due to changes to
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
statute or rules but instead was a
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
management choice
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
it undermined the achievement of
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
expected outcomes
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
the subject of extra jurisdictional
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
activities was where we had the most
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
significant disagreements with the
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
commission and is more fully discussed
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%

additionally elective training education
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%

controls to prevent unlicensed or

unpermitted possession or transfer of
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
alcoholic beverages and controls over
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
adulteration and misbranding were
 
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.670 align:start position:0%
adulteration and misbranding were
inadequate

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
premises inspection practices were
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
inconsistently effective with more than
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
41 percent of licensees not receiving a
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
regulatory visit during our two-year
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
audit period
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
nearly 32 percent of the inspections
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
that were conducted were excessive
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
for example one licensee received 35
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
inspections from six different
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
investigators over two years without a
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
recorded liquor law violation
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
compliance check operations did not
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively ensure
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
proper control and were not risk-based
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
controls over complaints investigations
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
and sanctions were inadequate
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
our recommendations here include
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
migrating extra jurisdictional
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
activities to a law enforcement agency
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
and constraining division activities to
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
current division management in place
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
since april 2017 did not create the
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
defective controls we identified many
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
defects were long-standing
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
nonetheless management was responsible
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
for effective and efficient operation
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
and reported undertaking a review of
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
internal practices identifying some of
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
the same issues we identified
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
a holistic approach to management
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
control could help ensure the issues we
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
identify will be fully remediated and
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
remain effectively controlled
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
developing such controls including a
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
risk-based data informed strategy and
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
supporting plans with detailed
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
implementing procedures will likely take
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of time and effort
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
without these underpinnings division
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
efforts to manage change run the risk of
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
occurring in isolation without obtaining
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
measurable improvements and achieving
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
expected outcomes
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
i would like to thank the commission
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
staff and numerous stakeholders for
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
their assistance during this audit and
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
unless there are any questions for me i
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from anyone on
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
so this is about
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
chapter three the direct shipper program
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
um looking through it appears that most
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
of the concerns
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
have to do with uh
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
u.s cities are being followed and
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
no rules and laws are being enforced
 
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.310 align:start position:0%
no rules and laws are being enforced
um

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
and then there was some comment about
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
customer service but was there
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
to get any information
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
on how effectively
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
um they're able to meet the needs of uh
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
customers for specialty things
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
in particular there's a couple of uh
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
restaurants in my district one who i've
 
00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:11.430 align:start position:0%
restaurants in my district one who i've
talked

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
where they've had chronic problems on
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
getting particular things uh through the
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
program they uh
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a specialty restaurant and they
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
stock some things i mean
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
they sell some things that aren't
 
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.350 align:start position:0%
they sell some things that aren't
normally

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
normally
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
carrying the liquor store and it's been
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
a real problem for us but was that
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
covered in this
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative it is not covered in this
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh what our chapter three addresses are
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
the control frameworks that the
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
commission has put in place to ensure
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
that proper control
 
00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:43.029 align:start position:0%
that proper control
occurred

00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:43.909 align:start position:0%
occurred
that

00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
the controls were
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
optimized profitability and that in that
 
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.110 align:start position:0%
optimized profitability and that in that
context

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
context
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
customer service was rendered so whether
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
a permittee received a permit timely and
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
that would be a direct shipper permittee
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
not necessarily somebody that was
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
seeking a hard to find item
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
whether they the permittee received
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
their permit timely and that there was
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
equitable resolution to their
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
application for a permit to ship into
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
so we did not look at the
 
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
so we did not look at the
ultimate

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
ultimate
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
end user or customer
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
whether the individual citizen or
 
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:18.310 align:start position:0%
whether it was a licensee
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:25.990 align:start position:0%
whether it was a licensee
[Music]

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
that's right we focused on the shipper
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
end of things because they were the ones
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is a question for either uh mr
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
grady or mr smith can you tell us
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
briefly um what is the purpose of the
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire liquor store and the
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner what are their ultimate
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
goals and what are the expected outcomes
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
right well i'll take that representative
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
statute establishes four expected
 
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.070 align:start position:0%
statute establishes four expected
outcomes

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
for the commission one
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
is to optimize profitability two is to
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
ensure proper control
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
three is to operate efficiently and
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
effectively and four is to provide
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
customer service
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
tax revenue and um
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
you know the the purpose of the i would
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
think the purpose of all these state
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
liquor stores is to generate because we
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
could have private stores right so what
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
kind of revenue are we expect is the
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
state expected to receive from this
 
00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:51.430 align:start position:0%
state expected to receive from this
commission

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
well we did not audit the larger
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
commission and its retail operations we
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
focused on its division of enforcement
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
and licensing which was responsible for
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
narrow subset of the commission's
 
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.430 align:start position:0%
narrow subset of the commission's
revenues

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so much it's very helpful yes
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%

00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up question um

years and one of the things that that
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
i've noted is that
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
in previous iterations
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
lba has
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh found deficiencies
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
the um the
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
deficiencies were
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
noted as
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
long-standing and unaddressed
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
before beginning your audit did you
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
review the previous uh
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
the previous audit that had been done
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative we did we reviewed a
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
number of them in fact thank you and and
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
did you uh
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
in on discovering that those decisions
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
reported that there was only one of the
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
21 observations from previous audits
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
that had actually been closed
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
when you reviewed the the
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
previous audit
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh and noted that deficiency still
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
existed did you query the person you
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
were dealing with as to what plans they
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
had to
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
address the previously unaddressed
 
00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:45.830 align:start position:0%
address the previously unaddressed
deficiencies

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%

consideration or did we make any
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%

substantially or fully complete
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
only 20 percent remain open but each has
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
been examined and a specific timeline
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
has been established for each of its

madam chair until all those are resolved
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
and of which 80 percent are partially
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
substantially or fully complete but we

representatives

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
and you know you're muted you're muted
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
sorry about that i'm going to pose the
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
same question that i did or to mr grady
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
which is um does the commissioner feel
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
that there need to be any personnel
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
changes as a result of the
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations made um by the audit
 
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.549 align:start position:0%
recommendations made um by the audit
well

00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative a few years ago the
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
liquor commission underwent
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
what i i would consider substantial
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
personnel changes we were switched from
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
a three commission agency to one
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and a deputy commissioner we
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
run the agency with just three
 
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.470 align:start position:0%
run the agency with just three
divisions

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
and um i'm sure you know but the net
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
profit for the liquor commission this
 
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
year versus prior is up 14.7 percent or
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
13.9 million and in the past 10 years
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
the sales of the liquor commission has
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
increased by over 200 million dollars i
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
think that everyone uh on the call sees
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
along with their constituents what the
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
liquor commission has done to develop
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
and refine a brand over the last 10
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
years we took stores from the corner dog
 
00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:07.590 align:start position:0%
years we took stores from the corner dog
legs

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
legs
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
of plazas we've created a brand we've
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
created a look and feel
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of our business comes from
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
cross border sales so people come to new
 
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire to buy wine and spirits much
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
like they do many other things our
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
prices are nationally recognized
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
and the liquor commission has been been
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
named the best control state in the
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
nation the past two years running we
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
clearly have a brand and we clearly are
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
a profitable business the enforcement
 
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.789 align:start position:0%
a profitable business the enforcement
division

00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
is a division of that and obviously uh
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
the audit has found some some findings
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
which we would consider substantial as
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
well but we would also uh like to remind
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
the committees that 80
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
are partially substantially or fully
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
complete and we look to complete the
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
other 20
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming years again some of
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
which will need law and some of which
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%

00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
representative the
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
one of the first things you'll see that
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
we have planned is reviewing the
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
strategic plan that's in place
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
looking at that critically and building
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
out measurable objectives from that as
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
recommended in
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
the in the audit report
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
a component of that is also to
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
at that time really identify and
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
consider what legislative
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
changes we would seek
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
one so
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
i i we can't specifically answer your
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
question at this time but what i can
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
offer that might be of assistance
 
00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:48.549 align:start position:0%
offer that might be of assistance
is

00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
some of the recommendations probably the
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
biggest recommendation that came out of
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
the report was around simplifying
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
the statutory the structure
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
both in terms of statute and the rules
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
so i think that would be the overall
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i'd like to add
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
mister thank you
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'd like to add mr
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
chairman is something that we've spoke
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
about in the past is looking at the
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
license structure for the for the state
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire which is uh
 
00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:27.669 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire which is uh
then

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better way to put it put
 
00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:31.030 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better way to put it put
together

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
through a number of years obviously the
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
commission has been in place since 1934.
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
there's been carve-outs in the licensing
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's been things that have been asked
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
the commission has been asked to do with
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
special licenses and all of us feel that
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
the license structure is too broad and
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
too bifurcated we'd like to be able to
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
look at that as time goes on
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
change our licensing structure from we
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
have 100 licenses chief
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
48 licenses down to perhaps a dozen and
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
we'd like to be able to to look at that
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh legislatively uh
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
through committee in order to change
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
that we we also know that there's a lot
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
of things that the commission does
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
on from a licensing standpoint
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
that as uh mr grady and mr smith have
 
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.069 align:start position:0%
that as uh mr grady and mr smith have
said

00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
that have maybe grown over the years and
 
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:30.210 align:start position:0%
can certainly be
 
00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.430 align:start position:0%
can certainly be
[Music]

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
can be can be qualified and
 
00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.230 align:start position:0%
can be can be qualified and
consolidated

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.190 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
as someone who has been around
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
actually sponsored one of those changes
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
and had my head handed to me on the
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
miles floor on that on the bill to trade
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
recordification because it had wasn't
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
explained to them about why
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
we ended up doing having a hundred
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
different licenses like an obscure
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
license on a
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
a private tennis court that they had to
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
have two tennis courts uh they did and
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
didn't have the food requirement where
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
others might have
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
made was that explained to them that
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
each one of those unique licenses was a
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
carve out in unique in in itself and
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why you know the the
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
ruler did not even need rule making but
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
that would all the
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
the the fee for instance the reason why
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
the fees are varied because each one had
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
a different what do we think was the
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
right fee
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
and that's how they were you know such
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
and so you know not just not just the
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
fact that we have all these hundred
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
licenses but we have all these different
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
fees that are related to that license
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
and was that explained to them that that
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
to try to reshuffle you're not going to
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
change it you're still going to have all
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
these sub categories
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
you you're just going to maybe you know
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
say oh this is a one kind of license and
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
we did that with the sport facility
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
license that that
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
you're really not going to solve
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
anything when you just all you're doing
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
is re-codifying and calling it something
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
different even though at the end of the
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
day they're all going to still have to
 
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
have their individual fees and their
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
individual rules about what was that
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
license was created for
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh respectfully mr chairman uh uh and
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to the lba
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
that was not the concern of the audit
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
and when those types of things were
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
brought forward as part of the audit
 
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.109 align:start position:0%
brought forward as part of the audit
those

00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
those weren't taken into consideration
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
the nuances the legislative changes what
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
has been done for
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh constituents as certain things come
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
up licenses change for your uh example
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
a tennis court license an expansion of
 
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.069 align:start position:0%
a tennis court license an expansion of
service

00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh a catering license
 
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.550 align:start position:0%
uh a catering license
uh

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
a license that would have to do with uh
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know a business that has multiple
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
bars or multiple locations all of those
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
things have evolved as the liquor
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
business has evolved
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
when we had just
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
one license for one establishment that
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
did business one way
 
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.109 align:start position:0%
did business one way
uh

00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know maybe that was uh 25 35 40
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
years ago we now have entrepreneurs and
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
i was one in the state for 15 years and
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
in other states for 15 that have uh that
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
have ideas about how their businesses
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
should run and how their businesses
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
should look so we can't
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
narrowly define licensure in in any
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
particular aspect we have to be flexible
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
along with the businesses and as they
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
change we need to change that's why
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
these types of licenses have been
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
brought forth and when i say mr chairman
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to evolve what we do i say
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
that respectfully to
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
what the what the legislature has asked
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
us to do over the years because we
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
recognize that this has grown to a point
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
where perhaps we could codify some of
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
these licenses and put some of these
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
things into a structure that would be uh
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
more feasible for people to understand
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and not
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
have to have a certain knowledge of the
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
business it's uh it's certainly a vast
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
structure but
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
mr mr chairman it works and that's why
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
it is the way it is
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you manager i have a
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
couple questions that are going to
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
depend upon the the answer i get
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh looking looking over at enforcement
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh in chapter five
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the area of page 250.
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
the enforcement officers within the
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
commission did they work out of their
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
homes or they were required to come into
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
an office in order to start their day as
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
um i could answer that for your
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative it's uh mark armagenian
 
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.829 align:start position:0%
representative it's uh mark armagenian
um

00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
director of uh enforcement and licensing
 
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:05.910 align:start position:0%
director of uh enforcement and licensing
um

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
twofold uh first and foremost um they
 
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.829 align:start position:0%
twofold uh first and foremost um they
are

00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:40:11.839 --> 00:40:14.550 align:start position:0%
are
contractually

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
contractually
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
on duty if you will
 
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
from the point that they leave their
 
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
from the point that they leave their
houses

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
houses
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
we put our employees
 
00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
in their geographic areas to be more
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible so we don't have
 
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.950 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible so we don't have
enforcement

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
enforcement
investigators

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
investigators
 
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.589 align:start position:0%
investigators
driving

00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
driving
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
crisscrossing each other driving all
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
over the state instead of
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
regulating in their
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
geographic areas just to cut out fuel
 
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.390 align:start position:0%
geographic areas just to cut out fuel
costs

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
but there are
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
the nucleus of the enforcement division
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
and they have desks that are assigned to
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
them are right here in liquor commission
 
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.950 align:start position:0%
them are right here in liquor commission
headquarters

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
look at looking at the excessive
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of this thing where
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 31 of the
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
of the places that were never inspected
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
versus 31 of the excessive inspections
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
is there any correlation between the
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
places that are excessively inspected
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
and the locations of your inspectors
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
where they start their day
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely so if i could just take a
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
step back to give you a uh
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
a good picture of what has occurred here
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
this audit itself has started two months
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
after i walked in the door to assess
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
this division with the new command step
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
that we have put together
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
in that two-month period we did an
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
assessment that lasted seven months not
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
an audit but an assessment to see where
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
we have fallen short as a division what
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
we need to fix and it all came down to
 
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.910 align:start position:0%
we need to fix and it all came down to
processes

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
processes
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the efficiency and effectiveness of
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
this division
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
so we at that time and it's a very good
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
point representative burroughs also
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
brought up a good point um
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
we were at 41
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
we are now which is outside of
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
the audit time it was not documented we
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
are now at 100
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
and for some reason that just does not
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
resonate through everybody that we keep
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
telling this to
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
we are a new division
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
75 percent of this command staff is new
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
and changed
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
from myself on through to the frontline
 
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:31.430 align:start position:0%
from myself on through to the frontline
supervisors

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
supervisors
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
we have redone our licensing
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
unit to be more customer friendly and
 
00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
our basis here was education right from
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
the get-go
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
and those were conversations that i had
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
had with representatives when i walked
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the door that expressed to me some of
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
the concerns that were going on that we
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
took into account and started fixing the
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
problem here is they are outside of this
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
window that occurred two months into me
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
one more question thank you very much
 
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.470 align:start position:0%
one more question thank you very much
okay

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
looking at the breakup of of how you
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
how you assign your inspectors according
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
to this report cheshire and sullivan
 
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.190 align:start position:0%
to this report cheshire and sullivan
counties

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
neither of which i represent
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
um if you appear to have no assigned
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
inspector whatsoever leaving that
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
i would presume the surrounding areas
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
with your plan being what appears to be
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
a geographical
 
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
a geographical
um

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
a geographical assignment basis
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
have you read since this audit have you
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
restructured a little bit to provide
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
those counties with an inspector that's
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated or you was your intention to
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
continue to operate under
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
what has happened that are meeting here
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
in this audit
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your question
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative twofold number one every
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
county in this state is covered by a
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
permanent investigator
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
every licensee knows who their
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
investigator is personally
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
and if there is a an issue it is dealt
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
with at the lowest level if it has to
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
rise up through
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
it it does so but but know this also
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
we've restructured the whole command
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
structure here
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
that our frontline supervisors are not
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
just sitting at a desk
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
supervising or correcting reports
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
when we dropped from 29 investigators
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
down to 21 we had to restructure we had
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
to repurpose
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
what we do for a daily
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
our daily duties
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
so our frontline supervisors actually
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
are the support mechanism on the road
 
00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
are the support mechanism on the road
for

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
not only
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
enforcing the rules of title 13 or the
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
laws of title 13 and the rules that that
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
are assigned to us but they are also
 
00:44:56.319 --> 00:44:57.109 align:start position:0%
are assigned to us but they are also
there

00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
as teachers to educate and do mts
 
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.670 align:start position:0%
as teachers to educate and do mts
training

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
lots training
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
teams training to servers throughout the
 
00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:07.109 align:start position:0%
teams training to servers throughout the
state

00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
and and they also cover an area
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
um whether whether it's doing an audit
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
or an inspection
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
um they they are multifaceted and and
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
nobody has just one hat that they would
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
um you
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh mr mullica you you said that i think
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
it was this marketing magazine out of
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
new york uh ranked you number third
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
um is ranking you number third
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
against uh private enterprises i mean
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
you sort of run the uh the liquor
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
commission as a private business i
 
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
understand or were you ranked against
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh other state uh
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
entities now i'm sort of interested
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
in who you might consider
 
00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.190 align:start position:0%
in who you might consider
uh

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know sort of a competition uh a a
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
business or state run similar to new
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire and what their profitability
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative i have all the data that
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to provide you that shows
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh how we rank in in
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
consideration with the other control
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
states we were we are ranked in that
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
magazine and in others
 
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.109 align:start position:0%
magazine and in others
as

00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
against private businesses as well and
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
our our number one competitor in the
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
united states is total wide
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
they're the largest
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
retailer in the united states beverage
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
wine and spirit retailer they also do
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
beer and cigars
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
they are in 26 states
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
they have about
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
198 to 201 stores depending on what you
 
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.910 align:start position:0%
198 to 201 stores depending on what you
read

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
they have about 1700 employees and in
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
2017 they opened between 2016 and 17
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
they opened six stores in the state of
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts when licensing had changed
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
there so
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's as high up in the states as they
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
are they have a few stores in
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
connecticut as well a couple in new york
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
a few in in
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
new jersey but they're they're the
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
largest competitor and we we don't rank
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves against other control states
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
because each control state model is
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
different the only other control state
 
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
that does the wholesale and the retail
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
much like we do would be pennsylvania
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
and we are we they are a larger state
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
obviously we are we've been ranked the
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
number one profitable control state
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
in putting ourselves against total wine
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
as competition that's that's sort of the
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
benchmark where we need to be and where
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
we are we saw a little dip in business
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
in 2016 and 17 when they opened six
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
stores in massachusetts inside the 495
 
00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.910 align:start position:0%
stores in massachusetts inside the 495
belt

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
belt
 
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.349 align:start position:0%
belt
directly

00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
putting their footprint against our our
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
business model but we've rebounded and
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
obviously the ship the sales this year
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
show it that our uh you know our revenue
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
breakdown versus prior year is that
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
we're up 14.7 this year
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of our business comes
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
from cross-border so we advertise
 
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.470 align:start position:0%
from cross-border so we advertise
cross-border

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
cross-border
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
and we promote cross-border we're not
 
00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:42.230 align:start position:0%
and we promote cross-border we're not
here

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
just to serve the folks inside the state
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire because that would be
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
limiting our market
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
obviously new hampshire is our primary
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
focus but with 50 percent of our
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
business coming from outside of new
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire we need to be a retailer
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's competitive in all those
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
surrounding states 23 plus percent of
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
our business does come from
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.309 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:18.319 --> 00:49:19.349 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go back to the
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
the tax revenue because
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
when people from new hampshire see the
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
liquor stores
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
and they see people buying them
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
they translate that to tax income they
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't transfer the liquor commission as
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
an entrepreneurial business
 
00:49:38.319 --> 00:49:39.349 align:start position:0%
an entrepreneurial business
however

00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
if you consider yourself that and
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
apparently you are considered that
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
within the state every business has
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
protocol that they have to follow
 
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.470 align:start position:0%
protocol that they have to follow
so

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know why
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
or in the past have you met with the
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to discuss previouses
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
to discuss previous issues with your
 
00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.109 align:start position:0%
to discuss previous issues with your
audits

00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:49:59.119 --> 00:50:00.309 align:start position:0%
audits
and

00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
why were those not fixed
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
and what can you do what can you say to
 
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.670 align:start position:0%
and what can you do what can you say to
us

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
that will assure us that your monthly
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
meetings with the fiscal committee is
 
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
well uh representative i can't speak to
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
the previous audits because i was not
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
here when those audits were brought
 
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:21.829 align:start position:0%
here when those audits were brought
forth

00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
and uh quite frankly i had no knowledge
 
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the of the audits
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
failures as as they were spoke about
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
from mr grady in this audit but i can
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
assure you
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
in my 35 years as an entrepreneur i've
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
never failed at anything
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't intend to fail at this
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
i've grown the liquor commission along
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
with the team that we have here by 200
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the last 10 years so
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
i think from our entrepreneurial
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint we're not measured against
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
what happens here in new hampshire we're
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
measured what happens around the world
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
we are a worldwide retailer we have
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
products from all over the world that
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
are shipped into the state from a tax
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
revenue standpoint is just a very small
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
piece of what we do we're a revenue
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
generating business
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
and in going back to what the fiscal
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
committee has now asked us to do as part
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
of their resolve is to come back every
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
month and let them know how we are doing
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
with this we did that last week and we
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
gave them the numbers that we brought in
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
front of you the 80 of these findings
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
are partially substantially or fully
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
complete and only 20 remain open
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that we will do
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
everything in our power to
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
bring this audit to a close as quickly
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
as we possibly can
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
please let him cheer i'll follow up
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying to me is at the
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%

don't have to keep raising your hand i'm
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
the one that's lowering it and that's
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
because i've already noted that you wish

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
the the report states that inefficiency
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
compromised the optimization of
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
profitability and to tie into the the
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
previous question about entrepreneurship
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering and i don't know the
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
answer to this do this does the state
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
allow a salary in certain certain
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
positions to be tied to both uh
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
profitability and revenue are you
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
we do not have a bonus system in place
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative follow please follow
 
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.630 align:start position:0%
uh representative follow please follow

um is that do you know do would you know
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
governor lynch uh put we put something
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2 back in 2010 or 2011
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
that allowed the liquor commission to
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
look at the possibility
 
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.190 align:start position:0%
look at the possibility
of

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
promoting that type of
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
revenue generation for our employees in
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
the stores
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
there was a number set on it i believe
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
it was 50 000 that could be shared among
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
employees i'd have to look back at the
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
full details of it representative to
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
speak with some certainty on it
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh mr uh maliki what percentage of whole
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
sales sales come from out of state and
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's those are wholesale we don't do
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
any wholesale out of
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
just retail out of state
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't necessarily track
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
out of state sales other than we do zip
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
code surveys which allows us to find
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
where people are coming from from other
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
states to buy in our stores so all our
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
all our
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
data that shows out of state sales has
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
been done from zip code surveys
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
with our consumers
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
and follow-up madam chair
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
a few years ago there was issues
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
in certain stores regarding
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
hennessy sales and
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
many of these sales were cash
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
transactions and many of these people
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
were from out of state can you explain
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
that to me
 
00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.990 align:start position:0%
that to me
well

00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
those rules are governed by the irs
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative and anyone that spends
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
more than ten thousand dollars in cash
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
in our stores is required at this point
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
to fill out an irs form if the sales are
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
under ten thousand dollars in their cash
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
or if they're over ten thousand dollars
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
in their credit uh no form is required
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's an irs requirement
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you welcome
 
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.430 align:start position:0%
all right thank you welcome
representative

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman uh
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things i always look at first
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
with a performance audit is
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
whether there is legislation required
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
to address the issue
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
because that's partly on us
 
00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:41.589 align:start position:0%
because that's partly on us
so

00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
in this case i think there are 11 which
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
would require legislative action are you
 
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.910 align:start position:0%
would require legislative action are you
currently

00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
working with one or more of
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh to uh to address
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
those issues
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
our representative at this point as
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're going through the findings uh
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
ceo wyan and the chief are looking at
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
what would be needed and what
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislative or rule changes would be
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
necessary and we will have a better
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
handle on that in the upcoming months
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
but we have a number of representatives
 
00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:20.150 align:start position:0%
but we have a number of representatives
and

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
senators in the state that do take an
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
interest in bringing those types of
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislation forward that do have a
 
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.549 align:start position:0%
legislation forward that do have a
background

00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
with the liquor commission and
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
understanding what we do and we'd
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
certainly be willing to uh bring it to
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
those uh representatives and or senators
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh when we feel that the time is right
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
and we have these changes in place that
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
we feel could make us
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
more efficient
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
okay well as they say that's on us so
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%

that you're reviewing with the fiscal
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%

letting them know what we've completed i
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
would imagine
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
that there will be a follow-up audit of
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement to make sure that these uh
 
00:57:56.319 --> 00:57:57.589 align:start position:0%
enforcement to make sure that these uh
findings

real you do understand what part of the
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
audit i'm referring to page 10 and 11
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
which has the
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
status of the findings of the audit
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not they've been
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
completed or whether or not they're they
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
have not been completed and of the 12

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
remediations
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to know and those are the
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
crux of the audit report those are the
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be addressed
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
to be addressed as a result of the audit
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
where do those 12
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
process those 12 remediations fall in
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
line with your priorities
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
and where when will that and will that
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
be addressed with the fiscal committee
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
these are very the 12 very specific
 
00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.390 align:start position:0%
these are very the 12 very specific
things

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative have you examined the
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
report of corrective action that was
 
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:38.010 align:start position:0%
sent out
 
00:59:38.010 --> 00:59:41.030 align:start position:0%
sent out
[Music]

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
because i believe that covers much of
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and this
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
question concerns the uh
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
extrovert jurisdictional enforcement
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
section in particular
 
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.829 align:start position:0%
section in particular
ages

00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
ages
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
231-242 i understand that um
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
that you took over and put in place you
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
know management team uh recently
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
so my question is um
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
does the agency response to this section
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
reflect um your views or
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
was that put together
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
representative

01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
um these
 
01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:34.549 align:start position:0%
um these
uh

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
these observations
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh the answers to them are our views
 
01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
uh the answers to them are our views
today

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
um know that
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
not only do we have rules administrative
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
rules that cover
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
are as you do know
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
our our
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
daily duties
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
but we have laws that need law
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement jurisdiction to actually
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
follow through with a majority of them
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
need law enforcement jurisdiction to do
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
so with with that in mind when we
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
regulate we only regulate to the point
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
of your community's safety
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
we don't there there has been some rumor
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
and innuendo out there that says that
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're over regulating or though that is
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
stuff that i we walked in the door
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
listening to
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
that has all changed to a point of
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
creating an environment of education we
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
believe compliance comes with education
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
so good people trip every day of the
 
01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.589 align:start position:0%
so good people trip every day of the
week

01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
we believe that in educating them we get
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
corresponding compliance out of them
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
which creates a
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
safe environment for the licensees
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
patrons and it also creates a safe
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
environment for the communities that
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
possibly these these negative instances
 
01:01:59.190 --> 01:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
that are around the use of alcohol
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
in over service could could incur
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes this is
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
this is truly the
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh answer that was done by this
 
01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh answer that was done by this
administration

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
um i had more in mind the question um
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
you know extra jurisdiction of course
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
and things that are arguably arguably uh
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
not directly related to
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
the job of the liquor commission that's
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
part one and the other part is i'm
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
looking at your corrective action plan
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
for uh item 38.
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
in the comments and elsewhere in here
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's uh
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
references to things like a dash 101 and
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's whatever
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
what are those references too and where
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
so the you're referring i think you're
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
referring to policy
 
01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.589 align:start position:0%
referring to policy
um

01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
and and that would be actually an
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
internal document here at the liquor
 
01:02:58.559 --> 01:02:59.670 align:start position:0%
internal document here at the liquor
commission

01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
disagreement on extra jurisdictional was
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
more we didn't disagree on whether or
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
not the division should be doing that
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
stuff we disagreed on the jurisdictional
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
point of it
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
that it was things that were outside of
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
our mission
 
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.589 align:start position:0%
our mission
but

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
within our jurisdictional realm and to
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
to be honest about it are those
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
um other things that we have done
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
in this uh this short snapshot of time
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
the duties that we have performed
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
um we're only looking at six instances
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
that fell outside of our jurisdiction
 
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.549 align:start position:0%
that fell outside of our jurisdiction
around

01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
that were life safety issues that had to
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
have intervention
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
there was a necessity for intervention
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
at that point and one right off the bat
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
was one of our investigators was at a
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
stoplight and had a woman passed out
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel of her car that was uh
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
actually if i'm not mistaken overdosing
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
on fentanyl
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
that investigator had to get involved in
 
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
that investigator had to get involved in
that

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
there was no other recourse to that and
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
these are the things that are being
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
documented here that just
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
i i'm not saying that they're
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
misrepresented because they are what
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
they are they're just
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
when you drill down and get into the
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
weeds on them there's a different
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
perspective on it
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
i have one one comment
 
01:04:32.319 --> 01:04:33.270 align:start position:0%
i have one one comment
the

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
response to observation 38 says there's
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
a difference of interpretation of the
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
statute and the statutory duties
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
would you make sure to include in your
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
legislative changes
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
a clarification of the statute
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
from your position
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
so that it can be
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
debated and approved by the legislature
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
or disapproved and we can settle this
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
interpretational issue
 
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:01.190 align:start position:0%
interpretational issue
with

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
and get it
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
definitely represent madam chair uh
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment we will also
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
provide case law
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
um to not only superior court but
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
supreme court that we've had cases that
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
decided at those highest levels
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
with cases that we have dealt with
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
with the licensees so we can definitely
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
provide all that
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you the the issue with case law is

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
on line 24 the original bill had said
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and stopped there
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
um we added back in in the lottery
 
01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:29.189 align:start position:0%
um we added back in in the lottery
commission

01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
so both the attorney general and
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
laundering commission shall confer and
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
determine if in their opinion and um
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
little discussion went on about um i
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
know i received an email from
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative bailey not liking uh the
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
word fit or not fit
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is the word they came up with for
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
replacement was
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
suitable and suitability
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then we just cleaned up the last
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
section of the statue going down through
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
it was just kind of redundant so we
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
combined those two last two sentences
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
into one
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be glad to take any
 
01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.709 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be glad to take any
questions

01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
or concerns
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
represent pearson
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
i think about your with the
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment is
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
this considered a rewrite
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes it is okay because the bottom of
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment has nothing to do it
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
mentions no um nothing about an
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
effective date or or anything like that
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct it only replaces section
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
two of the bill
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
section three on rulemaking
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
and section four on the effective date
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
okay so this yeah okay so this is not
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
this is amending the bill but it's not a
 
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
full rewrite i got you that's correct
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schuett do you
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
wish to speak on your second
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
um i will just say that
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
all members of the committee recognize

chair
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
when health and human services had this
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
bill originally they they really kind of
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
focused on some some of the other areas
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
they kind of really honestly according
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
to the chairman slipped through the
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
crack was they the oversight
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
and the review of the orders
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
by the chairman
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
and excuse me the commissioner of health
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
um there was in in the original
 
01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:36.390 align:start position:0%
um there was in in the original
legislation

01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
it was a pretty pretty good reduction of
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
that oversight committee
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
in discussions with
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
various folks that were
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
honestly unaware they were even being
 
01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.350 align:start position:0%
honestly unaware they were even being
removed

01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
it became pretty evident that if the
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner of health and human
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
services is going to issue in a a
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
directive or
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
an order
 
01:25:58.719 --> 01:25:59.750 align:start position:0%
an order
that

01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
realistically the folks that are going
 
01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.470 align:start position:0%
realistically the folks that are going
to

01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:04.629 --> 01:26:04.639 align:start position:0%
most likely carry that type of a health
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
order out
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
and when i say that it's one of the
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground folks really should
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
probably be on that advisory committee
 
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.750 align:start position:0%
probably be on that advisory committee
to

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
discuss and
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
and uh advise whether or not the the
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
order that's coming out is practical to
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
to actually do it so i i can like you
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
can imagine that the chaos if the
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
if health and human services
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
director issue issued an emergency order
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then the boots on the ground all
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
rose up and said hey we can't actually
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
implement this so it's not a good look
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
for the state it's it's just not good
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
public policy and
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
and frankly it uh
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
we can we can head this all off so
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
this was uh in discussions with the
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
chairman of health and human services
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
and their ranking member or the vice
 
01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.470 align:start position:0%
and their ranking member or the vice
chair

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
they uh they both didn't have an issue
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
with this restoring a couple of these
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
spots at all
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
the reason the county representative was
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
not restored is because after
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
discussions with those stakeholders the
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
county really doesn't
 
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.390 align:start position:0%
county really doesn't
um

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
supply anything
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
to this action so
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.470 align:start position:0%
the the
the

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
they felt that the county representative
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
really served no purpose
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
on this so that's why
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
just to
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
answer the question ahead of time that's
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
why the county representative was not
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
is involving do you wish to add
 
01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:34.390 align:start position:0%
is involving do you wish to add
something

01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
no i think representative pearson
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
explained it very well
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
all right excellent
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
representative

01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh so i have
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
some reservations with it
 
01:27:51.750 --> 01:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to this issue
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh first of all uh i think it the
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
the concept violates
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
our rules that no committee or
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the house can bind the
 
01:28:02.239 --> 01:28:04.229 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of the house can bind the
house

01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
and this would be a joint committee
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
binding the entire legislature
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
it may be that under certain
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh
 
01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
such an action is warranted i understand
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
that it
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
requires effectively a four-fifths vote
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.910 align:start position:0%
of the committee
um

01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
i also
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh am troubled by the idea that you may
 
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
uh am troubled by the idea that you may
have

01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
people who are primarily politicians
 
01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.470 align:start position:0%
people who are primarily politicians
uh

01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
deciding uh
 
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.430 align:start position:0%
deciding uh
something

01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
that is beyond their
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
their expertise
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
being quite quote-unquote just
 
01:28:44.639 --> 01:28:46.070 align:start position:0%
being quite quote-unquote just
politicians

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
politicians
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
to the degree that people are
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
technicians in their private lives
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
doctors lawyers
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
i don't mean lawyers doctors nurses
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
people who have knowledge of
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
as i say i have i think it's
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
fundamentally flawed with regard to the
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or committee aspect
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
violating our rules
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
but also the makeup of the committee
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
would have to be something where they
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
are getting involved
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
with overriding a decision of a
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner who ideally should be
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
something of an expert
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the field
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
of hhs
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
historically have been
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh somebody who was background in that
 
01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.470 align:start position:0%
uh somebody who was background in that
field

01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
so anyway that those are my uh can
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
my reservations about proceeding with
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
chair representative pearson can i
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
remind representative schmidt that this
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
is an oversight advisory committee and
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's justified
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
isn't it the case that they can
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
basically with a four-fifths vote
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
all right yes i believe that's still
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
um i just had a question regarding the
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
county thing the sheriff's departments
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
would have any
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so what would happen within
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's department the sheriff's
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
department would end up
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
falling under
 
01:30:41.199 --> 01:30:42.149 align:start position:0%
falling under
whichever

01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
whichever
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency was the lead on
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
this and they would be brought in with
 
01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.790 align:start position:0%
this and they would be brought in with
them

01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that it's not a county necessarily a
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
county thing because you would have a
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
joint law enforcement
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
action i only asked the budgetary side
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
would there be an expense to the county
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
by them being
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
deputized for a lack of better term into
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
a bigger law enforcement effort
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
i you know i mean i the state already
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
has a procedure
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
for that as far as like if the state
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
police bring in uh a joint task force
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
and stuff so i would i would presume
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
that it would fall under the same
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines that they do already
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
just follow them follow um
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
did you consult with the counties and
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
they said we really don't
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
i can tell you we're rocking him
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
accountable yeah so they so we're good
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
well because the the rocky at least
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
rockingham county has never actually
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
even gone to the table with us they've
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
never been involved and because their
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
their role was
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't provide anything so
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
um concerned with the surprise budgetary
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
in fact that's all well i mean typically
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
too when you look at
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
this this level of
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know when an action like this is
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
taken it's done under a declared action
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
by the state so at that point you have
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
those other things that kick in
 
01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
those other things that kick in
um

01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that's what i'm looking
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
for from a reimbursement standpoint
 
01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.830 align:start position:0%
for from a reimbursement standpoint
chair

01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes does
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
does representative schmidt have a point
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
it is a concern that
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
a committee of the legislature cannot
 
01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.470 align:start position:0%
a committee of the legislature cannot
bind

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
bind
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
the entire legislature
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
so in this case i would say that
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
part that says it's subject to review is
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
fine there's no question about that
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
but the rescinded by a vote of the
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
committee is as representative pointed
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
out not
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.350 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's explicitly against
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
our rules
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
but but if we have
 
01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.229 align:start position:0%
but but if we have
additional

01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh oversight over
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
executive orders which will be in house
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
built 417 which is coming up next
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
and that would qualify and this would
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
a recession that would be
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
approval or disapproval by the
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
entire legislature
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
and keep in mind too this was this made
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
it through the house once with less than
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
10 people voting against it so it was
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
clearly a bipartisan uh
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
desire for this to i'm just concerned
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
that if he's right i don't want to i
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
i think the point is that it
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
the review is
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
and if they think it's that bad they
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
could probably convince the rest of the
 
01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.110 align:start position:0%
could probably convince the rest of the
house

01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative schmidt
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
until they do this this this says they
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
can rescind
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh you and i are on the gel car you know
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
that we can't even we can't stop uh
 
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.070 align:start position:0%
that we can't even we can't stop uh
and

01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
a proposed rule by ourselves uh uh uh
 
01:34:29.199 --> 01:34:30.310 align:start position:0%
a proposed rule by ourselves uh uh uh
the

01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh the required motion
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
has to be subsequently
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh approved by both house and senate uh
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
for the um
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
for that uh
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
action of the jail car to be upheld and
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
and it's can be completely legitimate uh
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
that something should not go forward but
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
even as powerful and well-established
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
committee as the jail car cannot do it
 
01:34:58.950 --> 01:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
by itself and i think this says it says
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
we sin uh i don't i think we have to
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
check with the clerk uh before we can
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
proceed this i i don't think this flies
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
all right i tend to agree with you
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt i will confirm
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
that the clerk and see if this is
 
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:19.910 align:start position:0%
that the clerk and see if this is
allowed

01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:20.790 align:start position:0%
allowed
um

01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go through with the vote on
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment which does not affect this
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph first
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then we will
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
recess until wednesday
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair question representative
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
we normally only will put forward one
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
amendment on a bill
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if we should not defer
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
on this amendment
 
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
if the clerk agrees that that language
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
should be changed
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
from the bill shouldn't that be
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
incorporated into a new amendment
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh fine
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
good point
 
01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:05.990 align:start position:0%
good point
well

01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
one of the aspects i'd like to address
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
as well is that
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
after this bill was heard i spoke with
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that uh and he took my
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
point and i my understanding was that he
 
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:22.950 align:start position:0%
point and i my understanding was that he
was

01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh i asked him to think about a way of
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
doing something that might be very
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate it's not certainly not
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the i
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
anybody's imagination that a
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner could uh put forth some
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
kind of an order
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
just a bad idea something that shouldn't
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
go forward and there should be some way
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
that an expert committee of the of the
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature and that's what i spoke
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
to earlier uh could weigh in and say
 
01:36:52.639 --> 01:36:53.750 align:start position:0%
to earlier uh could weigh in and say
uh

01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
10 day hold 20 day hold whatever it
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
might be
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
some way of
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
putting the brakes on something that's a
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
bad idea
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
but i think rescinding is something that
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have the power to do as a
 
01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.790 align:start position:0%
we don't have the power to do as a
committee

01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.149 align:start position:0%
committee
so

01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see us confer with
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative marsh to see what he may
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
have come up with in the meantime as
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
well but we certainly ought to check
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
with the clerk to see if this thing
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
flies or not
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
it looks like the clerk is
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:30.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's just the computer at the head of
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
okay representative schmidt if you would
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
consult with representative varnish
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
again i will consult with the clerk
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
and if necessary get another amendment
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh i think you're right we don't
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
this is beyond our authority at this
 
01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
this is beyond our authority at this
point

01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much and i i
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
certainly will be happy to speak with
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative marsh again about what he
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
just

01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
a couple seconds to say this i have
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
never ever liked the job car has to bow
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
agency that's not finding the
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
legislature that's finding an agency
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
just never like the job card gets
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
overruled by an agency and
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
i did like day one i still don't like it
 
01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
i did like day one i still don't like it
okay

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.310 align:start position:0%
okay
fine

01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
who cares
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
in that case moving right along
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh on house bill 417 i'm going to move
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
up to pass
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
and i move
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
amendment 0810
 
01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:51.189 align:start position:0%
amendment 0810
second

01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
just a question have we been provided
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
yes sir it was sent out by miriam along
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
with the other amendments for today
 
01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.030 align:start position:0%
with the other amendments for today
okay

01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
i have not seen it yet so i apologize
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
it's the one that i sent out of draft
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
earlier with the
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh technical issues like spelling and
 
01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:13.189 align:start position:0%
uh technical issues like spelling and
fists

01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
fists
 
01:39:13.199 --> 01:39:16.550 align:start position:0%
fists
and

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
i will mention what it does it keeps
 
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:20.950 align:start position:0%
i will mention what it does it keeps
the

01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
because that will eliminate the need for
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
executive orders need to be approved
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
and it adds in that the governor and
 
01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.629 align:start position:0%
and it adds in that the governor and
council

01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
the governor cannot accept
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
emergency funds
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
by himself he needs to to have the
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
council with it
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
which is the normal
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
normal process
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes representative thank you
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
um i thought we were going to have a
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
work session on this we were i don't
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
know i don't think we discussed it we
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
discussed part of it but i didn't think
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
we were completed we had finished our
 
01:40:08.239 --> 01:40:10.950 align:start position:0%
we were completed we had finished our
discussions

01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
this is an executive session
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
if discussion is encouraged
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
and if it results in a decision
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
or a consensus to
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
revise the amendment then that will such
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
such will happen that's why i'm doing it
 
01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.030 align:start position:0%
such will happen that's why i'm doing it
today

01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
and not on wednesday i see thank you
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
i had emailed you my concerns
 
01:40:51.189 --> 01:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
about the first section of this
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
reiterate those concerns that
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be renewed by the majority of
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
each chamber of legislature prior
 
01:41:05.199 --> 01:41:07.109 align:start position:0%
each chamber of legislature prior
determination

01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
there is no exemption in this as there
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
the period that
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
follows in
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
if we are unable to meet that those will
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
automatically be
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh extended in a fourth day 14-day
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
increments that provision is not in this
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
first section regarding the
 
01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:33.270 align:start position:0%
first section regarding the
um

01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and uh that's
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
concerning because if we are unable to
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
meet there's no way of extending this or
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's no circumstance to extend this
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
um so i want to bring that forward
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
if we can't meet it keeps the extensions
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
are approved
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
on 14-day increments you can just say
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
as as provided in paragraph whatever
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah no it's
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
easy enough to fix but it it needs to be
 
01:42:14.719 --> 01:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
easy enough to fix but it it needs to be
delivered

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:17.010 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
01:42:17.010 --> 01:42:28.390 align:start position:0%
delivered
[Music]

01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
um and also i just
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
still have concerns about
 
01:42:33.199 --> 01:42:33.910 align:start position:0%
still have concerns about
the

01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
if it's an extended state of emergency
 
01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.510 align:start position:0%
if it's an extended state of emergency
that

01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee is not included in this
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
i understand the governor and council
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
for a the brevity of an event where they
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
need to make quick decisions but an
 
01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.870 align:start position:0%
need to make quick decisions but an
extended

01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
extended
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
circumstance or emergency like we have
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
now i think and we heard
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative weiler even confirmed
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
that they should be involved yes and the
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
statutes defining the duties of the
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee specifically says that
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
any transfer over 100 that is
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
that goes through the governor and
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
council which these would has also has
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
to go through fiscal if it's over a
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
so they are involved
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
but not during the immediate
 
01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.430 align:start position:0%
but not during the immediate
um

01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
acceptance of a grant or whatever
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
is the governor able to suspend that is
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
that going to be
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully in our wording
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
we write a committee report
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
that uh that is the intent of this
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
answer my own question oh excellent i
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
love that that's good when that happens
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so i'll come back
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
to a point that i believe i spoke to uh
 
01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:01.830 align:start position:0%
to a point that i believe i spoke to uh
when

01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh when we discussed this previously and
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is that i this this is in my view
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
entirely driven by the extraordinary
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we can currently
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
confront with regard to a pandemic
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
ordinarily a governor's emergency orders
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
are going to apply to something which is
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
very temporary very reason very regional
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
i spoke about the alstead flood
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
which ripped out a highway
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
made this the community almost
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
completely inaccessible
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you know governor then governor
 
01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:38.950 align:start position:0%
and you know governor then governor
lynch

01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
lynch
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
called the legislature in for a special
 
01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.070 align:start position:0%
called the legislature in for a special
session

01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh we
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
appropriated some money i believe to
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
take immediate action
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
but that was very local very temporary
 
01:44:52.239 --> 01:44:53.109 align:start position:0%
but that was very local very temporary
and

01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:53.119 --> 01:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
and
hurricanes

01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
hurricanes
 
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.590 align:start position:0%
hurricanes
floods

01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
floods
 
01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.830 align:start position:0%
floods
snow

01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
snow
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
most of these things are either regional
 
01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.229 align:start position:0%
most of these things are either regional
or

01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
temporary or both uh whereas a pandemic
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
is a health
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
situation uh it's a it currently a one
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
in a hundred year situation uh and
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative pearson in his remarks
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
talked about the possibility
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
of an emergency at seabrook now that
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
would be of a different nature but it
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
certainly would be one that impacts
 
01:45:22.239 --> 01:45:23.750 align:start position:0%
certainly would be one that impacts
health

01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:25.030 align:start position:0%
health
and

01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
the last week was the 10th anniversary
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the fukushima disaster which
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
rendered that entire prefecture which is
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
basically like the entire sea coast and
 
01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:36.550 align:start position:0%
basically like the entire sea coast and
southeast

01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
southeast
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh corner of new hampshire
 
01:45:39.119 --> 01:45:40.229 align:start position:0%
uh corner of new hampshire
uh

01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:40.239 --> 01:45:41.750 align:start position:0%
uh
uninhabitable

01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
uninhabitable
 
01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:42.870 align:start position:0%
uninhabitable
and

01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
except for a few people who have come
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
back in against the government's orders
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
that entire area is now a wasteland
 
01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.669 align:start position:0%
that entire area is now a wasteland
uh

01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
and the idea that that the governor is
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
going to issue an executive order and
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to be renewed every
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh every couple of weeks effectively uh
 
01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.510 align:start position:0%
uh every couple of weeks effectively uh
is

01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
that that's not really workable in an
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstance like we have
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
yes i would like to
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
explain that if you have a
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
an emergency of 30 days or less
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
which most of the weather related
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
emergencies are this does not affect
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
anything right this only affects renewed
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
states of emergency
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
and in the of something like
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
we could meet
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
to consider executive orders at that
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
point it it's not if there's a regular
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
normal weather related emergency
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's we
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
actually extended it from 21 to 30 days
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure it won't need to be renewed
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the legislature will not have to get
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
involved because we don't need to
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
well i i do understand i'm aware of that
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
i do understand i think that this is
 
01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.109 align:start position:0%
i do understand i think that this is
just

01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
as i say it's an extraordinary
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance where it's believed by
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
people across the
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
spectrum i think not just not just
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
republicans and not just democrats uh
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
that the governor
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's that's of sense that many
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
people have that the governor has
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
exceeded his authority that he has
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
violated the law you know overstepped
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
the constitution and so forth and so on
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
and there's legitimacy to
 
01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh to reflecting on that
 
01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:38.310 align:start position:0%
you know uh to reflecting on that
uh

01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to dismiss it i think
 
01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:41.590 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to dismiss it i think
that

01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
we already talked about the joint fiscal
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
in my opinion should have been involved
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
in the expenditure of funds that this
 
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.750 align:start position:0%
in the expenditure of funds that this
gopher

01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
gopher
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
task force that the governor created
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
that was completely his creature but
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
also completely under his control had no
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
authority over him whatsoever
 
01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:59.430 align:start position:0%
authority over him whatsoever
was

01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
basically like a hand puppet you know
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
disagreeing with the uh with the uh with
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
the of the with the owner of the hand uh
 
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.109 align:start position:0%
the of the with the owner of the hand uh
that's

01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
it's troubling
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
and it is something that needs to be
 
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.590 align:start position:0%
and it is something that needs to be
considered

01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.109 align:start position:0%
considered
uh

01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
but i think that the idea that you're
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to get the legislature even if you
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
call it in
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
every 30 days and so forth
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
is i don't really think it's workable
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
and and ordinarily i don't think it's
 
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's a situation which would exist i
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
think the ordinary kind of natural
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
disaster type of emergency that we are
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
all familiar with we've had hurricanes
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've had floods and so forth that have
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
devastated certain areas for certain
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
periods of time uh
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
object to the governor
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
getting everybody necessary involved in
 
01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:53.830 align:start position:0%
getting everybody necessary involved in
that

01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh in this current situation or the
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
seabrook emergency if it were to a god
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
forbid ever occur
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh those are
 
01:49:05.430 --> 01:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
special situations
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i do think we need to look at
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
this that's why i think this bill should
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
be retained
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
so that we can actually sit down and and
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
strategize on
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
the appropriate way to make sure that
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
the governor cannot run wild
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think he's done that in this
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
particular case some aspects of the
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
lockdowns for example i thought the
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
initial cut before he said
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
essential please let me finish the the
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
essential stuff had
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
was allowed to stay open non-essential
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
had to shut down
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
i thought within relatively short order
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
that you could have said can this can
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
this business even though it's not
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
essential can it operate in a way that's
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
safe for its employees and safe for the
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
general public and if that's the case
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
that that business should have been
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to reopen so that the business
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
would not have been financially ruined
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
schmidt i agree with you completely on
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
that point
 
01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:04.790 align:start position:0%
that point
but

01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.830 align:start position:0%
but
this

01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to be
 
01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.470 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to be
a

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
rough night
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
to be a first pass in establishing some
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
control over emergencies we have
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
two other bills about emergencies that i
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
that i expect we will retain
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
and work on to develop these things but
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
i think that getting something out this
 
01:50:30.719 --> 01:50:31.750 align:start position:0%
i think that getting something out this
year

01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.550 align:start position:0%
year
is

01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
important to a large number of people to
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that the
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
that in a future emergency the governor
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't go off with by himself without
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal without
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature without anybody
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
and so this is a
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
relatively simple bill
 
01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
well we recognize we've and this has
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
been discussed previously
 
01:50:59.590 --> 01:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
that nothing's going to be done to stop
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
the governor this time around and and he
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
would be likely to veto it i don't think
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's enough agreement to override a
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
veto but that's hypothetical uh i i
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from i i
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
really have a serious question about uh
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
viability workability and and and that's
 
01:51:20.239 --> 01:51:21.669 align:start position:0%
viability workability and and and that's
necessity

01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
necessity
 
01:51:21.679 --> 01:51:22.550 align:start position:0%
necessity
so

01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:23.290 align:start position:0%
so
we'll

01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:23.300 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:24.709 align:start position:0%
we'll
[Music]

01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
put you on
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
i believe i'm of the understanding that
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
you are looking at uh crafting a
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
new amendment to this bill
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i would urge you i believe
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
a large number of members of the
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee would be
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with a new amendment if
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
it did at least include a
 
01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:52.950 align:start position:0%
it did at least include a
cross-reference

01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
cross-reference
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee statute
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative blackness
 
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you ma'am chair um
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i i understand that in this uh you
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
know current emergency
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
there was general agreement um
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
you know not to end the state of
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
emergency and we haven't i think one of
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
the virtues of this
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
is that it permits the legislature
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
to review in you know individual
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
executive orders i think there were
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
there may have been executive individual
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
executive orders that
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
a majority of the legislature might want
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
to see either eliminated or at least
 
01:52:33.199 --> 01:52:34.629 align:start position:0%
to see either eliminated or at least
modified

01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
modified
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
and the problem is we only had this big
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
hammer which was either in the state of
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
emergency or not
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
and and that was a problem
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
so i think the biggest value of getting
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
this in is that to have a little more
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
fine-grained control the governor could
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
settle the state of emergency but the
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
legislature can review
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
um the individual orders and i think
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
getting that in is important
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
um i think you're right that you know
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
almost all the other kind of emergencies
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
except maybe a seabrook thing
 
01:53:05.350 --> 01:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh this wouldn't apply and extending the
 
01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
21 to 30 days kind of makes it more
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.669 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that this sort of
 
01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.950 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that this sort of
emergency

01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
may be more likely in the future than we
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
would have thought
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know we don't know what's going to
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
happen with you know new versions of
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
cove or some other disease or whatever
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
um so having a legislature involved both
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
in looking at the emergency orders and
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
having fiscal involved i think it's
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
important to get out there
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can and the effective date
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
of this isn't
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
until 30 days after the current state of
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
emergency is over so you know it's
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's not going to affect the current one
 
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
because we know politically that's
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
not going to work it may not be a good
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the thoughtfulness that
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
you're going at this with tony but but
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
again the workability to the degree that
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
you get the legislature in in something
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
obvious the pandemic
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
was not well understood and there was a
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
bad information that came out you know
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
from and so forth and people were
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
we were told by the then president we
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
were told this will go away this is a
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
hoax it's this that what have you a lot
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
of which turned out to be very bad
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
information but it misled a lot of
 
01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
people now you're going to get the
 
01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:29.589 align:start position:0%
people now you're going to get the
legislation

01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
i think it's such a simple building it's
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
interlocking and uh covers
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
several different aspects of an
 
01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:39.830 align:start position:0%
several different aspects of an
emergency

01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:54:41.669 --> 01:54:41.679 align:start position:0%
i don't see at all where it's not
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
workable uh because the decisions are to
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
be made down the line
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
so it covers the immediate emergency by
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
giving the governor the
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
latitude he needs
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
and then it covers a more prolonged
 
01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:56.310 align:start position:0%
and then it covers a more prolonged
emergency

01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
if the legislature can't meet
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
and it covers a more more prolonged
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
emergency if the legislature can meet
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
and that includes a seedbook type uh
 
01:55:05.199 --> 01:55:06.550 align:start position:0%
and that includes a seedbook type uh
problem

01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh but most importantly is that
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
it brings in the voice of the people
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
which is the legislature
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
and i think that's
 
01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
the most important aspect of this so um
 
01:55:17.580 --> 01:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
the most important aspect of this so um
[Music]

01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
i just i don't see
 
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
the complications or the non-workability
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
of it and
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
i like it with the minor changes that
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
need to be made
 
01:55:29.199 --> 01:55:30.870 align:start position:0%
need to be made
represent

01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative lectus is referred to the
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
hammer and that's our only choice
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
i have never forgotten that we have that
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
hammer the question i have is why
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
don't people talk to one another if the
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
governor were to uh
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
act in an irresponsible capricious way
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's a president of the senate and a
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house that go into his
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
office and say hey look cut it out we
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
have the votes to stop this
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
people should talk to one another
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
including the governor talking to
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
committees about some of these bills but
 
01:56:07.599 --> 01:56:08.550 align:start position:0%
committees about some of these bills but
that's

01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's all i wanted to say
 
01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.310 align:start position:0%
that's all i wanted to say
representative

01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
i would just add that
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
currently the legislature has the
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
ability to stop a state of emergency
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
what's happened in the meantime is the
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
state of emergency has gotten too big to
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
fail so if we were to go in and pull the
 
01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
drain plug on this right now it would
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
cause chaos throughout the state because
 
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the number of executive orders that
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
have intertwined themselves into all
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
facets of life economically health-wise
 
01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.189 align:start position:0%
facets of life economically health-wise
so

01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know in theory we could do it but
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
practically we can't
 
01:56:47.189 --> 01:56:47.199 align:start position:0%
and you know to represent schmidt's
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
point that you know this is a once in a
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
decade lifetime whatever
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we have emergency laws for
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
emergencies and so even if it is a rare
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
emergency we've learned it can happen
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
and we should prepare for it so i i
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
agree with what's been said this
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
provides flexibility for the governor to
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
deal with immediate emergencies but it
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
avoids a situation where we have a one
 
01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh one person
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
controlling the legislative actions the
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
executive actions in some cases even the
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
court actions by by closing them down
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
for the last year and that was never
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
envisioned and we should be prepared for
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
that to happen again so i think that we
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
need to move forward with this bill now
 
01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.109 align:start position:0%
need to move forward with this bill now
other

01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay in that case we will recess for
 
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
lunch i will get another amendment that
 
01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.629 align:start position:0%
lunch i will get another amendment that
includes

01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
includes
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
a press reference to fiscal and an
 
01:57:46.719 --> 01:57:47.830 align:start position:0%
a press reference to fiscal and an
exemption

you
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
some of you all of you may have it um
 
03:01:46.630 --> 03:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's an amendment with myself and
 
03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
representative marsh as the sponsors i
 
03:01:51.510 --> 03:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
think he's the prime sponsor but uh what
 
03:01:54.469 --> 03:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
it does is it adopts the methodology
 
03:01:56.550 --> 03:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
that i reference in my remarks this
 
03:02:00.389 --> 03:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
morning about the gel car where this uh
 
03:02:03.910 --> 03:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
this committee of the
 
03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:05.190 align:start position:0%
this committee of the
uh

03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:06.710 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:07.830 --> 03:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we were referencing that we're
 
03:02:11.269 --> 03:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
trying to have the authority with us
 
03:02:14.630 --> 03:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
four fifths vote to uh to basically uh
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
suspend uh the comm commissioner's
 
03:02:18.720 --> 03:02:20.389 align:start position:0%
suspend uh the comm commissioner's
order

03:02:20.389 --> 03:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
order
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
subject to the approval of the
 
03:02:23.279 --> 03:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
subject to the approval of the
legislature

03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
subsequently but in the mean
 
03:02:29.910 --> 03:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
time the commissioner's order would not
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
and represented mcguire the chair
 
03:02:38.150 --> 03:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
is familiar with it from the shell car
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:44.790 --> 03:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
so that otherwise otherwise we like this
 
03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
we we want this uh this bill to go
 
03:02:50.950 --> 03:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
forward i'm totally supportive it's the
 
03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
the other aspect of it was troubling
 
03:02:57.190 --> 03:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
okay so that if the joint resolution is
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
introduced timely
 
03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:00.070 align:start position:0%
introduced timely
the

03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:04.070 align:start position:0%
the
uh

03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:06.550 --> 03:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
the emergency order is
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
stayed until the resolution is settled
 
03:03:17.110 --> 03:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
now if well i guess if you missed the
 
03:03:20.710 --> 03:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
boat but
 
03:03:22.550 --> 03:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
the the the committee ought to be able
 
03:03:24.469 --> 03:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
to act pretty quickly if they if you got
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
a four-fifths agreement among the
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee members that the
 
03:03:30.950 --> 03:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner's order is unwise or
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
unwarranted uh then
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
i think they would do it you and i have
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
seen what that's like on the jail car
 
03:03:39.510 --> 03:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
when we have a situation where the rule
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
is improper
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
in whatever fashion unsupported
 
03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:45.269 align:start position:0%
in whatever fashion unsupported
that

03:03:45.269 --> 03:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:47.830 --> 03:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
a joint resolution gets enacted and the
 
03:03:49.990 --> 03:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislature ordinarily supports that
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
because the jail car in that case is the
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
technical committee that recommends it
 
03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
technical committee that recommends it
uh

03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:57.590 align:start position:0%
uh
and

03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
i have a huge question yes
 
03:04:00.790 --> 03:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative pearson representative
 
03:04:02.309 --> 03:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
schmidt i'm curious as to why all of my
 
03:04:04.070 --> 03:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
changes in part three were not included
 
03:04:07.269 --> 03:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:09.750 --> 03:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
the only change in my amendment is uh to
 
03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:10.469 align:start position:0%
the only change in my amendment is uh to
my

03:04:10.469 --> 03:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that this
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
that the two-thirds
 
03:04:16.870 --> 03:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
03:04:19.990 --> 03:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh suspect rescission of a
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner's order
 
03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
will be changed representative schmidt
 
03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
the issue is that we had an amendment
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
that we were considering and you should
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
have amended the amendment
 
03:04:36.070 --> 03:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
rather than creating a different new one
 
03:04:37.590 --> 03:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
and this isn't an efficient moment and
 
03:04:39.670 --> 03:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
this is not an official amendment so we
 
03:04:42.550 --> 03:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
can't do too much
 
03:04:44.300 --> 03:04:44.310 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:04:44.310 --> 03:04:45.670 align:start position:0%
all right
[Music]

03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:04:48.070 --> 03:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
well can we suspend the whole operation
 
03:04:49.990 --> 03:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
until we can fix the amendment so that
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
we can act on it uh
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
in a profit form
 
03:04:56.389 --> 03:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
i believe we that is the appropriate
 
03:04:58.389 --> 03:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
thing because
 
03:04:58.399 --> 03:04:59.750 align:start position:0%
thing because
uh

03:04:59.750 --> 03:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
we can't have amendments all right we
 
03:05:02.840 --> 03:05:04.550 align:start position:0%
we can't have amendments all right we
will

03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
put it off in other words
 
03:05:09.190 --> 03:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
yes we
 
03:05:11.349 --> 03:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
if we can't get ols
 
03:05:13.110 --> 03:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
to support
 
03:05:13.120 --> 03:05:14.309 align:start position:0%
to support
um

03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
support us this afternoon he's planned
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
to stay here as long as necessary on
 
03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:21.670 align:start position:0%
to stay here as long as necessary on
wednesday

03:05:21.670 --> 03:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:22.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:05:22.469 --> 03:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
because yes these these fixes should be
 
03:05:24.479 --> 03:05:28.150 align:start position:0%
because yes these these fixes should be
incorporated

03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:30.150 --> 03:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
in time
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
i want to get it right yes
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
we have at least two days
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
so in the meantime i will move that we
 
03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
retain house bill 275
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
relative the governor's power to
 
03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
initiate a state of emergency and
 
03:05:49.190 --> 03:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
various emergency powers
 
03:05:53.910 --> 03:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:56.070 --> 03:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things in it that we can
 
03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
use to consider
 
03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
what we're doing on two on 417 and
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
modify it
 
03:06:04.319 --> 03:06:06.790 align:start position:0%
modify it
uh

03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
you can incorporate all this good stuff
 
03:06:08.479 --> 03:06:09.750 align:start position:0%
you can incorporate all this good stuff

that will be retained
 
03:08:42.230 --> 03:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i believe the only other bill we can
 
03:08:45.750 --> 03:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
vote on is house bill 433
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
limiting renewal of states of emergency
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative roy moved itl on house
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill 433 is there a second
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
that was truman yep
 
03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:14.070 align:start position:0%
that was truman yep
yes

03:09:14.070 --> 03:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:09:15.269 --> 03:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
all right do you just speak to your
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
motion uh just briefly we we've got one
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
bill that we're going to work on towards
 
03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
passage and we've got another retained
 
03:09:24.710 --> 03:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
in our pocket to work on further um so
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
keeping another one is is certainly
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
redundant so
 
03:09:30.630 --> 03:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
let's clear up
 
03:09:35.510 --> 03:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%

03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right any uh
 
03:09:47.190 --> 03:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the motion has
 
03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
been expedient to legislate on house
 
03:09:53.349 --> 03:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
bill 433
 
03:09:55.510 --> 03:09:55.520 align:start position:0%

about
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
but uh this song i was inspired to write
 
03:32:44.550 --> 03:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
the song back in 2015. i was just on the
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
back of a motorcycle ride going to the
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
franconia notch with my husband
 
03:32:50.309 --> 03:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i just was looking around at the
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
beautiful um scenery and the lack of the
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
man on the mountain thinking um it would
 
03:32:57.590 --> 03:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
be really nice to have a song that would
 
03:32:59.830 --> 03:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
represent new hampshire and what it's
 
03:33:01.830 --> 03:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
all about and the beautiful landscapes
 
03:33:03.030 --> 03:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
that it has
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
so on the back of that motorcycle ride i
 
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
just started having all these thoughts
 
03:33:08.469 --> 03:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
so when i got home
 
03:33:10.710 --> 03:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
a week later i had the lyrics written
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
and then i set up the melody to go with
 
03:33:15.670 --> 03:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
the song and then my 603 was born
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
in february of 2016 i took a trip to
 
03:33:20.950 --> 03:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
nashville to record my second album with
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%

03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
my second album was called music is in
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
my heart
 
03:33:29.670 --> 03:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the my 603 song was the second track
 
03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
on that album
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%

03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%

representative phillips
um

03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:11.590 --> 03:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i would like to um echo what
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative schultz said it's it's i

listened to it it's a cute cute little
 
03:37:15.920 --> 03:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
listened to it it's a cute cute little
song

03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
song
 
03:37:19.269 --> 03:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
um my question though has to do with
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
copyright like is the song copyrighted
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
because if we're going to adopt
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
something as a state song i think it has
 
03:37:28.870 --> 03:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
to be available for anyone to
 
03:37:32.229 --> 03:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
to use it and play it wherever and
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
whenever they want
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
well it's a i'm sorry can you hear me
 
03:37:37.040 --> 03:37:38.389 align:start position:0%
well it's a i'm sorry can you hear me
yes

03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:37:38.399 --> 03:37:39.830 align:start position:0%
yes
um

03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's when i um administer all songs now
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
when you record music
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
are mp3s more than albums or cds so when
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
you go through the process of putting
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
your music online
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
i go through a company called tunecore
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
and that's how i distribute my music and
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
they copyright it there as it's
 
03:38:02.950 --> 03:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
distributed out so basically it's on all
 
03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the major download sites it's on amazon
 
03:38:07.590 --> 03:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's on uh
 
03:38:10.229 --> 03:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
itunes it's on spotify it's on all those
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
major download cite you just type in my
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
603 and you can go and download it
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
um so but it's free i mean i give you
 
03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
know if i have to sign something giving
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
you guys permission to
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
to play it or have me come play it i
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
mean i'm giving you the song as a gift
 
03:38:30.790 --> 03:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
because i think new hampshire needs this
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
and i and it's something positive
 
03:38:32.960 --> 03:38:33.990 align:start position:0%
and i and it's something positive
and

03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
but i think that's something we could
 
03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
look into i
 
03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
03:38:41.590 --> 03:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i answered your question
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
or not well well oh follow up
 
03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%

03:38:56.469 --> 03:38:56.479 align:start position:0%
you um since since i don't know nothing
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
about how that works i appreciate your
 
03:39:01.510 --> 03:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
answer because obviously i didn't know
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
how it works but i i do think that's
 
03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
important i have no idea how to go about
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
03:39:09.030 --> 03:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
well yes it's already copyright i have
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
they use well no if they want to go and
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
download a song off
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
you know they will
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'd i get pennies for it because it goes
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
through a process but on like spotify
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
you buy a membership and i get pennies
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
for you know if somebody streams one of
 
03:39:36.150 --> 03:39:36.160 align:start position:0%

but um
 
03:39:43.030 --> 03:39:43.040 align:start position:0%

03:39:52.469 --> 03:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:52.479 --> 03:39:55.269 align:start position:0%

03:39:55.269 --> 03:39:55.279 align:start position:0%

03:40:03.030 --> 03:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
are you a member of ascap or some
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
similar songwriting
 
03:40:04.960 --> 03:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
similar songwriting
group

03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
no um i signed up for that many many
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
years ago but i never renewed it um
 
03:40:14.950 --> 03:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
because i went through tunecore it's a
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's what a lot of the newer artists are
 
03:40:20.070 --> 03:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
doing to distribute the music because
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
back then before they had a lot of um
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
was albums and some cds now that we're
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the whole world of mp3s and
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
downloadable music tunecore was the way
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
to go
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase this if
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
someone were to use any of your songs
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
to do a cover of them for commercial
 
03:40:50.160 --> 03:40:51.349 align:start position:0%
to do a cover of them for commercial
purposes

03:40:51.349 --> 03:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:40:53.110 --> 03:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
then you would definitely get a fee is
 
03:40:54.870 --> 03:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
well i think if um
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
i was hoping if somebody wanted to use
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
my song that i would have an opportunity
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
to maybe come sing it live for or
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
for a commercial or be a part of it
 
03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
somehow or being either tagged as the
 
03:41:10.720 --> 03:41:11.750 align:start position:0%
somehow or being either tagged as the
writer

03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
writer
 
03:41:13.590 --> 03:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i think it's important to know if
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
they use the song to give the person who
 
03:41:18.550 --> 03:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
i still don't know if that answered your
 
03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:24.630 align:start position:0%
i still don't know if that answered your
question

03:41:24.630 --> 03:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:41:27.190 --> 03:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
hello miss uh murphy um actually um
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
you're one of my constituents um so i
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for contributing in
 
03:41:38.309 --> 03:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
the way that you have to the state
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
um thank you i just wanted to as far as
 
03:41:43.510 --> 03:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
the copyright thing goes the way my
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of it would go is that
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like francis scott keys you
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
know the national anthem anyone can sing
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
it anywhere anytime
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
correct and that would have to be the
 
03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
same with this if it's a state song um
 
03:41:58.870 --> 03:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
anyone could sing it anywhere anytime
 
03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
and there'd be no
 
03:42:02.550 --> 03:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
copyright infringement because
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
as you said you'd have to actually i
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
think give it to the state or at least
 
03:42:08.070 --> 03:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
wave your copyrights to it
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think so i mean that like with
 
03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
any song anybody can take any song like
 
03:42:15.910 --> 03:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
i do the same thing when i perform i'm
 
03:42:18.710 --> 03:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
always singing somebody else's music i'm
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
a cover artist
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
so i cover a lot of miranda lambert
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of the new artists out there for
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
country music
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
so i sing my originals i'm also covering
 
03:42:31.269 --> 03:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
other people's music so
 
03:42:31.279 --> 03:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
other people's music so
um

03:42:32.309 --> 03:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:32.319 --> 03:42:33.269 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:42:33.269 --> 03:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
the places that i sing this music in
 
03:42:39.910 --> 03:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
they have to have um pay fees to the
 
03:42:39.920 --> 03:42:40.950 align:start position:0%
they have to have um pay fees to the
state

03:42:40.950 --> 03:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
or to those companies licensing
 
03:42:44.950 --> 03:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
companies to have people sing live music
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
in their buildings
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
so it's it's very
 
03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
complicated but
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'm giving permission for
 
03:42:55.190 --> 03:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
my 603 and if i have to actually sign
 
03:42:55.200 --> 03:42:56.469 align:start position:0%

support it to become an official state
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%

that there was absolutely no copyright
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
issue and that anybody
 
03:43:38.309 --> 03:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
could perform it anywhere in
 
03:43:40.710 --> 03:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances um
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%

03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
song is no different
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
actually it's less different because
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not as famous as the person probably
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
wrote the national anthem you know i'm
 
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
just a singer-songwriter in candy in new
 
03:44:05.920 --> 03:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
just a singer-songwriter in candy in new
hampshire

03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:44:06.960 --> 03:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire
um

03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
the national anthem was written
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
200 years ago
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
the situations are not at all similar
 
03:44:27.429 --> 03:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
03:44:29.429 --> 03:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i should say uh thank you
 
03:44:30.870 --> 03:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:31.830 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

03:44:31.830 --> 03:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
does the producer or distributor of your
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh album music have any financial
 
03:44:39.030 --> 03:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
interest in this because
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
they would also have to wait rights for
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
this to become public domain as well
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
all right so tunecore
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
is just a
 
03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
online site that you pay
 
03:44:53.750 --> 03:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
them to distribute your music
 
03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
they don't own
 
03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
my music but they they once you
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
upload your music there and you say you
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
are the writer of this song then they
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
say okay you're the writer and then they
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
say if somebody else starts to take your
 
03:45:10.070 --> 03:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
music and they'll say no that belongs to
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
so and so but that's just to protect
 
03:45:16.150 --> 03:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
music as it goes up online
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
and on youtube
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
but other than that that's the only
 
03:45:20.319 --> 03:45:21.429 align:start position:0%
but other than that that's the only
place

03:45:21.429 --> 03:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:45:21.439 --> 03:45:22.309 align:start position:0%

too well it took my best friend's life

36 years old

since her passing i've met many more

families impacted this disease by this
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
disease within new hampshire and across

03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
inahara
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
i have a question i was quite surprised
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
several years ago to learn that men can
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
also have
 
03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
breast cancer
 
03:49:23.439 --> 03:49:24.229 align:start position:0%
breast cancer
do

03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
is that also metastatic or is it
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
differentiated as as it may be with
 
03:49:31.750 --> 03:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
women i'm sorry not too knowledgeable
 
03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
about the subject oh um yeah so men can
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
also you're correct they can also have
 
03:49:39.189 --> 03:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
breast cancer i've actually met a man
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
with metastatic breast cancer
 
03:49:43.349 --> 03:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
he was actually in our campaign last
 
03:49:43.359 --> 03:49:44.389 align:start position:0%
he was actually in our campaign last
year

03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
speaking about his experience because
 
03:49:49.110 --> 03:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
not many people are aware that men
 
03:49:51.990 --> 03:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
can actually get breast cancer and any
 
03:49:54.309 --> 03:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
person can get diagnosed at any stage of
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
cancer so you can be diagnosed at stage
 
03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
zero one two three or four when you get
 
03:50:01.349 --> 03:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
to stage four that is when it becomes
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
metastatic because it's spread
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the breast and into vital
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
organs like long liver brains bones and
 
03:50:12.150 --> 03:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's metastasized so people sometimes
 
03:50:13.990 --> 03:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
have the misconception that
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know there's a breast cancer
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
originated but then it came back as
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
liver cancer it's not actually true the
 
03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
cancer spreads and actually attacks
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
different areas of the body
 
03:50:26.550 --> 03:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
so you're actually actually correct men
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
do have this and i have met someone that
 
03:50:28.560 --> 03:50:30.550 align:start position:0%
do have this and i have met someone that
does

03:50:30.550 --> 03:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i learned it from a friend it seems
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's a lot of
 
03:50:33.840 --> 03:50:35.110 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's a lot of
unawareness

03:50:35.110 --> 03:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
unawareness
 
03:50:35.120 --> 03:50:35.830 align:start position:0%
unawareness
uh

03:50:35.830 --> 03:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
inspiration about the subject in general
 
03:50:39.510 --> 03:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
even though it's
 
03:50:41.429 --> 03:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
it's well known so thank you very much
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
for bringing it to our attention you're
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
correct and that's exactly what we're
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
trying this campaign is geared to do i
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
was one of those people that really had
 
03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
two grandmothers that had breast cancer
 
03:50:53.429 --> 03:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
and they were known as survivors i had
 
03:50:55.110 --> 03:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
the misconception that if you get breast
 
03:50:57.750 --> 03:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
cancer this is one of the better cancers
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
to have because you can overcome it
 
03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
because i saw both my grandmothers and
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
so i got a hard reality when my best
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
friend was diagnosed and together we did
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of research and i learned a lot
 
03:51:10.150 --> 03:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
more than i ever realized
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
attached to breast cancer
 
03:51:14.469 --> 03:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome thank
 
03:51:18.150 --> 03:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:19.750 --> 03:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:51:22.710 --> 03:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
um my question is do you have
 
03:51:25.110 --> 03:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
any events or
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
planned any events planned
 
03:51:32.389 --> 03:51:32.399 align:start position:0%
on this day to try to get out your your
 
03:51:34.389 --> 03:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
information because we can we can
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
identify something as a
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
right day that's recognized in the state
 
03:51:42.469 --> 03:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire but the state can't
 
03:51:42.479 --> 03:51:43.590 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire but the state can't
really

03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:51:46.070 --> 03:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
do the information campaign for you so
 
03:51:47.429 --> 03:51:47.439 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering
 
03:51:50.710 --> 03:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
i understand thank you yes we do um so i
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
actually um have a entire group um of
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
mostly women and men to the other
 
03:52:00.389 --> 03:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
representatives point that have
 
03:52:02.150 --> 03:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
stage four metastatic breast cancer and
 
03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
we have we've created a community where
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
there's a representative across each
 
03:52:06.479 --> 03:52:07.750 align:start position:0%
there's a representative across each
state

03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:52:09.990 --> 03:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
representing their own state so i help
 
03:52:10.000 --> 03:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
representing their own state so i help
with

03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:52:13.510 --> 03:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so um i work with the
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
local like i've worked with seacoast
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
online the past couple of years and
 
03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
fosters to basically share why is the
 
03:52:21.189 --> 03:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
because your point if you don't
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
understand why things are lighting it
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make a difference so
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
we've shared
 
03:52:25.359 --> 03:52:26.469 align:start position:0%
we've shared
why

03:52:26.469 --> 03:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
the bridge in new hampshire if we take
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
it local to our state is lighting and
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
the impact behind that
 
03:52:32.720 --> 03:52:33.510 align:start position:0%
the impact behind that
and

03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
invited the community to the bridge

03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
left anything behind
 
03:52:52.710 --> 03:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
but we also
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%

you can see
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the northern part of my district the
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
best part is that it's one of the first

03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
really anyone that wants to go out and
 
03:57:20.469 --> 03:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
participate in this uh phenomenon we
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
have mr yeams with us today which will

that you will pass this section to help
 
03:57:29.590 --> 03:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
recognize it because like we saw in uh
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
former solar eclipses they are
 
03:57:35.269 --> 03:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
they get a lot of people coming into
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
various states when when it happens and
 
03:57:39.910 --> 03:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of demand on solar eclipse
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
eclipse goggles and there's also a bit
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
of planning that um i think our teachers
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
should be doing um in in order to help
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
their students participate in this event
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%

ustse on monday april 8th 2024 will be
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
100 percent over coast county and 95

03:58:59.030 --> 03:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
tsc with 65
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
over conquer
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
in the solar eclipse world 65 is a

03:59:09.910 --> 03:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
two years ago i founded the new

03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%

in new hampshire
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
to plan promote monetize and celebrate
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
this wondrous event
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
basically we have a celestial super bowl
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
coming to our backyard and we don't even
 
03:59:39.030 --> 03:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
need to build a 200 million dollar
 
03:59:41.429 --> 03:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
stadium to take advantage of it
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
however we do need to plan and prepare
 
03:59:46.309 --> 03:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
as much as possible and as early as
 
03:59:48.790 --> 03:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
possible to leverage our good fortune
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
for the entire state
 
03:59:52.469 --> 03:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
after networking nationally with the
 
03:59:56.309 --> 03:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
american astronomical society and nasa i
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
now know that there is no right time to
 
04:00:01.189 --> 04:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
start getting ready for a tse
 
04:00:03.830 --> 04:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
that leaves us with two options either
 
04:00:06.790 --> 04:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
we will be early or way too late
 
04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
i started networking the 2017 tsc about
 
04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
a year and a half ahead and quickly
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
realized i was way too late
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
since after 2024 the next tse to occur
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire will be in 2079 i have
 
04:00:25.670 --> 04:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
chosen to go nice and early with the n
 
04:00:29.110 --> 04:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
the nhtse in 2024.
 
04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
of course that's not even taking into
 
04:00:33.429 --> 04:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
account a global pandemic potential
 
04:00:35.910 --> 04:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
label blizzard or anything else that can
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
happen to us over the next three years
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
good thing we started early
 
04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%

04:01:53.830 --> 04:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah mr yeems i did i didn't hear you
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative would you find
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:07.030 --> 04:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes do you have the long-range weather
 
04:02:07.040 --> 04:02:09.269 align:start position:0%
yes do you have the long-range weather
forecast

04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
forecast
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
i i do not but one thing that i've
 
04:02:15.030 --> 04:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
learned is you can't control the weather
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
i've started to network with
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
a fellow
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
concord resident daniel fry
 
04:02:22.160 --> 04:02:23.110 align:start position:0%
concord resident daniel fry
who

04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:02:26.229 --> 04:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
happens to be blind legally blind he's
 
04:02:28.870 --> 04:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work with the
 
04:02:28.880 --> 04:02:30.070 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work with the
uh

04:02:30.070 --> 04:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:32.550 --> 04:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
national blindness foundation
 
04:02:35.830 --> 04:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
and he is aware along with me of many
 
04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
different uh devices that are used to
 
04:02:42.150 --> 04:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
experience solar eclipses for visually
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
impaired folks such as sound vibration
 
04:02:47.990 --> 04:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
and various other apps that are
 
04:02:50.710 --> 04:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
available and our intention because
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
early april is not the best time
 
04:02:55.990 --> 04:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
weather-wise in northern new hampshire
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
is to make sure far ahead of time that
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of these apps available
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
so that if weather does not
 
04:03:04.640 --> 04:03:05.429 align:start position:0%
so that if weather does not
uh

04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:07.990 --> 04:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
help us out on that day we'll have
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
something for the tens of thousands of
 
04:03:12.790 --> 04:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
people that'll be in northern new
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire to still experience this uh
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
once in a lifetime event
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you very much
 
04:03:23.910 --> 04:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you and
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for uh
 
04:03:28.070 --> 04:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
drawing attention to this i'm on um i'm
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
looking at national eclipse.com which is
 
04:03:32.389 --> 04:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
a map a nasa map
 
04:03:32.399 --> 04:03:33.510 align:start position:0%
a map a nasa map
basically

04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:03:35.189 --> 04:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
and just so just so i can get the
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this right
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
the the path that they're
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
that they're showing here which which
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
the center of never actually does travel
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire it's really close
 
04:03:45.359 --> 04:03:46.790 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire it's really close
but

04:03:46.790 --> 04:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the rift of this path will be is
 
04:03:48.960 --> 04:03:49.830 align:start position:0%
the the rift of this path will be is
this

04:03:49.830 --> 04:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
is this like the full the full monty if
 
04:03:54.150 --> 04:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
you will the whole the whole shebang is
 
04:03:56.469 --> 04:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
within the swath here
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.910 --> 04:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
intersects with 91 in vermont is that
 
04:04:05.910 --> 04:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
is that the range of the full eclipse
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct the the eclipse
 
04:04:11.110 --> 04:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
will start early in the morning
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
in miss atlanta mexico and then the the
 
04:04:17.349 --> 04:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
zone of totality which is that zone
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 60 70 to 100 110 miles
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
wide the zone heads
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
from mazatlan mexico into texas
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
just goes just uh northwest of san
 
04:04:34.950 --> 04:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
antonio continues on through i believe
 
04:04:38.070 --> 04:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
10 or 11 states missouri arkansas
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
kentucky illinois
 
04:04:42.070 --> 04:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
new york
 
04:04:45.269 --> 04:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
ohio pennsylvania
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
and then heads into northern new england
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
goes through burlington vermont northern
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire coast county
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
continues on through maine and then
 
04:05:00.309 --> 04:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
continues through the maritimes
 
04:05:02.870 --> 04:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
prince edward island new brunswick and
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
newfoundland so one of my goals in
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
starting so early because new hampshire
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
does not have great weather prospects in
 
04:05:12.550 --> 04:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
early april
 
04:05:16.229 --> 04:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
we are looking to be the first to have a
 
04:05:18.150 --> 04:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse bill
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh not only in the us
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
but also in mexico
 
04:05:27.030 --> 04:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
and canada so all of north america
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
and we've sort of tied in with the fact
 
04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
that first in the nation primary we are
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
looking to be the first to actually pass
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
a solar eclipse day bill but uh i don't
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
think will be the last
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
however i i like i like to compare us to
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh neil armstrong when he stepped off
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
the eagle lander onto the surface of the
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
moon he did say that's one small step
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
for man this is one small step for new
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire but after that he didn't say
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay folks that's it we're good
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
everybody back in the lander we're out
 
04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
of here we're heading home you know so
 
04:06:06.150 --> 04:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully this might get a few other
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
states hopefully in in new england and
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe other states across the country
 
04:06:13.670 --> 04:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
will follow our lead
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
but uh i've learned that most people
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
remember who was first on the moon
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
second on the moon
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
even third in that group they never made
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
it to the moon they made it a lot closer
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
than i did but when you get up to 10 15
 
04:06:27.120 --> 04:06:27.990 align:start position:0%
than i did but when you get up to 10 15
20

04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
20
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
the the memory of of who walked on the
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
moon isn't as good so
 
04:06:34.389 --> 04:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
i like to be number one or number two
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm advancing this bill
 
04:06:40.150 --> 04:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
working to advance it so early
 
04:06:42.870 --> 04:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative roy
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
question i'm not sure if we answered or
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
not but what is um what would be the
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
if the river cooperates what would be
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
the best spot in new hampshire to be to
 
04:06:54.550 --> 04:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
observe this eclipse
 
04:06:57.030 --> 04:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
the best spot will be if you draw a line
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
from the southwest to northeast
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
from lancaster new hampshire
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
to milan
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
if you draw a line right along that
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
thing anywhere north
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
of that line
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
that'll be a hundred percent
 
04:07:16.150 --> 04:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
totality that will be where it'll go
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
tonight in the middle of the day you'll
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
be able to see stars and planets this
 
04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
actually the picture behind me my
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
background is a picture of the 2017
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
eclipse i did not take that that's a
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
picture from nasa that is actually at
 
04:07:32.479 --> 04:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
picture from nasa that is actually at
sunset

04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
as the sun is slipping beneath the waves
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
and it was eclipsed at that time and
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
it's just starting to see the diamond
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
ring effect the folks way up in
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
newfoundland and off the shore of
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
newfoundland will see something like
 
04:07:52.150 --> 04:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
this on that day because they'll be
 
04:07:56.550 --> 04:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing at it at sunset and
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
something else um that's coming up
 
04:08:02.150 --> 04:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
really quick i haven't done anything
 
04:08:03.990 --> 04:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
official with it but in less than three
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
months on thursday june 10th
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire the east coast the
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
northeast i suggest getting up early on
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
that day because on that day at sunrise
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
at 506
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
the sun is actually going to come up
 
04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
partially eclipsed by the moon
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
which is really really rare um there
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a lot of notice about it
 
04:08:30.229 --> 04:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
because the main part of it starts north
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
of toronto goes over the north pole ends
 
04:08:36.150 --> 04:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
up in russia but again we'll still be
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
able to see it and that brings up a good
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
point too even though the path of
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
totality is up in northern new hampshire
 
04:08:46.870 --> 04:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
everyone in new hampshire will have
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
at least 95
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
and in salem nashua it'll be 95
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the farther you go north through the
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
state it'll go from 95 to 96 97 98 99
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
and then when you hit lancaster it'll be
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
totality and my
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
intention networking with tourism
 
04:09:07.359 --> 04:09:08.950 align:start position:0%
intention networking with tourism
commerce

04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
04:09:10.710 --> 04:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
local businesses
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
is to basically if you're not in
 
04:09:15.910 --> 04:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
lancaster and north
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
to basically stage people south of there
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
in hotels bnbs wherever churches
 
04:09:26.150 --> 04:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
wherever we can set up people and then
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
organize to people travel north north of
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
lancaster either the night before the
 
04:09:36.150 --> 04:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
day of but obviously you can't set this
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
up a month or two or even a year ahead
 
04:09:41.670 --> 04:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
this takes a lot of planning and that's
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
why we're advancing the bill so early
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you

representative schmidt
 
04:09:52.150 --> 04:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:09:52.160 --> 04:09:53.189 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:55.110 --> 04:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
having had the privilege of seeing this
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
presentation the previous time
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
remember vividly that the
 
04:10:03.760 --> 04:10:04.469 align:start position:0%
remember vividly that the
the

04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:04.479 --> 04:10:06.070 align:start position:0%
the
speakers

04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
had some literature which i'm wondering
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
whether you have some for us or can
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
recommend linked to us
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
to understand the significance of
 
04:10:17.439 --> 04:10:18.550 align:start position:0%
to understand the significance of
early

04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
early
 
04:10:18.560 --> 04:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
early
planning

04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
planning
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:28.550 --> 04:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
04:10:32.150 --> 04:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
written materials were very impactful
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
and some of the people who talked about
 
04:10:35.199 --> 04:10:36.070 align:start position:0%
and some of the people who talked about
the

04:10:36.070 --> 04:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
eclipse their eclipse experience down in
 
04:10:40.070 --> 04:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
tennessee i think
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
um it was very
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
impactful with regard to how important
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
early planning is
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh if because otherwise it turns into a
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
disaster do you have such a link or
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
i i do i sent out a package uh
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative roy i think you received
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
that package
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
i i had a response from you
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
i did yes okay if you could afford it to
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative schmidt and if there's
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else that didn't rece i thought i
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
sent it to everybody i may have it i may
 
04:11:15.750 --> 04:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
have it i'll look for it
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay i get deluged
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
and thanks for providing the background
 
04:11:25.510 --> 04:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
photograph that's pretty phenomenal
 
04:11:25.520 --> 04:11:35.269 align:start position:0%
photograph that's pretty phenomenal
itself

04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:11:40.150 --> 04:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my my question
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
i remember
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i learned last
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
year when when we heard about your bill
 
04:11:51.030 --> 04:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
was that you can't reuse those glasses
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
04:11:57.110 --> 04:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
in 2017 so i think that's an important
 
04:11:57.120 --> 04:11:58.309 align:start position:0%
in 2017 so i think that's an important
safety

04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:11:58.319 --> 04:11:59.349 align:start position:0%
safety
message

04:11:59.349 --> 04:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
message
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
and is that
 
04:12:03.670 --> 04:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
part of your uh planning to make sure
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
that there are plenty of glasses
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
available and that people know what they
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
can use and what they can't use
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
yes that's that's part of it and this is
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
something as i'm networking with nasa
 
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the aas across the country
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
representing new hampshire but linking
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
up with other states and other groups
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that happened in 2017
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
is it was very tough to get the general
 
04:12:30.790 --> 04:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
public aware
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
of what was happening and what was
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike and the resulting
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
that resulted in the
 
04:12:42.150 --> 04:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
not large number of companies that can
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
make these certified
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
safe glasses because these glasses
 
04:12:49.429 --> 04:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
safe to look at the sun that's all
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
they're good for you know you look at
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
the sun and you protect your eyes and
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
you can see the sun you can see the
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
eclipse but if you look at anything else
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
with these glasses you just see darkness
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're like a level 14 welder's glass
 
04:13:07.110 --> 04:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
so it's very very important that we have
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
good safe glasses and that we have
 
04:13:13.110 --> 04:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
people planning ahead people don't
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
plan to fail they just fail to plan and
 
04:13:19.030 --> 04:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
what happened specifically in 2017
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
was as august 21st got really close
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
people realized they didn't have glasses
 
04:13:27.670 --> 04:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
as we all do these days they went online
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
many of them went to amazon and amazon
 
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
did have glasses but some of the glasses
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
that amazon had were coming from china
 
04:13:39.750 --> 04:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the the safety the
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
copyright laws how they do business in
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
china is not quite the same as here and
 
04:13:45.920 --> 04:13:46.710 align:start position:0%
china is not quite the same as here and
i

04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
have nothing for or against china or
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
amazon however some of the glasses that
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
were obtained by that route were not
 
04:13:59.670 --> 04:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
proper glasses they were not
 
04:13:59.680 --> 04:14:00.710 align:start position:0%
proper glasses they were not
safe

04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
safe
 
04:14:03.189 --> 04:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
and when you're talking about your eyes
 
04:14:04.950 --> 04:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
and looking at the sun
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
you need to have that assurity far far
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
ahead i think amazon actually ended up
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
taking down stuff or not selling it now
 
04:14:15.990 --> 04:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
everybody was confused and one of the
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
things that some people don't realize is
 
04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
there are no
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
pain sensors in your eye
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
so when you're doing damage to your eye
 
04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
by light you don't feel it you don't
 
04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
realize it but if you're using improper
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
glasses or something that's not blocking
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
out the rays to protect your eyes you're
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
doing eye damage you don't know it you
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
might not know it even for a couple of
 
04:14:44.950 --> 04:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
days and one of the things is eye damage
 
04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
can often be
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
permanent and can often be irresistible
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
and given the fact that you only have
 
04:14:53.750 --> 04:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know one set of eyes it's not
 
04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
something you want to be messing around
 
04:14:58.870 --> 04:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
with so my networks have
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
very experienced very safe people
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
another thing that we can do
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
if we plan early enough is we can enroll
 
04:15:08.469 --> 04:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
optometrists and ophthalmologists
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and let them know
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
hey if someone has a question about a
 
04:15:17.110 --> 04:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
pair of glasses are you willing to
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
be a site that they can bring the
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
glasses to you prior to the event and
 
04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're good
 
04:15:27.030 --> 04:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
and again there's so many different
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
things i mean
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
one thing that they planned in casper
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
wyoming when i was out there
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden six months before the
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
event people realized because it was in
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
august they didn't have enough
 
04:15:38.319 --> 04:15:39.590 align:start position:0%
august they didn't have enough
porta-potties

04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
porta-potties
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
and they started calling around to get
 
04:15:45.429 --> 04:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
more porta-potties and lo and behold
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
because the event was everywhere nobody
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
had any left and they have to source
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
them from quite a ways away at quite
 
04:15:53.750 --> 04:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
significant expense so
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's the little things you want to look
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
at and
 
04:15:59.670 --> 04:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know we have a super bowl coming but
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's not just a super bowl in our
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
backyard it's the backyard of maine new
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire quebec ontario
 
04:16:09.670 --> 04:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh newfoundland new york so there's
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:16:13.990 --> 04:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
we want to be early better to be early
 
04:16:15.990 --> 04:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
than way too late
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:16:18.479 --> 04:16:21.189 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
representative

04:16:21.189 --> 04:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
hello mr james i'm curious
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
if you have a project projected time of
 
04:16:30.479 --> 04:16:31.510 align:start position:0%
if you have a project projected time of
day

04:16:31.510 --> 04:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
that the total eclipse would be
 
04:16:36.149 --> 04:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
occurring in new hampshire
 
04:16:39.030 --> 04:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
i do it's going to be approximately
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
3 30
 
04:16:43.030 --> 04:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
p.m in the afternoon
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
the whole event however will start at
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
about 2 o'clock
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
and will run till about 5.
 
04:16:53.910 --> 04:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
so it's a slow process as the sun starts
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
to i'm sorry the moon starts to move
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
across the sun and the picture behind me
 
04:16:59.680 --> 04:17:01.189 align:start position:0%
across the sun and the picture behind me
shows

04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
shows
 
04:17:03.670 --> 04:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
the end of totality and the moon is just
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
starting to move off of the sun it's
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
called the diamond ring effect that is
 
04:17:10.550 --> 04:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
stage three
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
so pretty much prime time
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes prime time however
 
04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
planning is is important you could be up
 
04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
in pittsburgh you could get a hotel and
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
then you could realize gosh looking to
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
the east there's a big mountain there
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
and if
 
04:17:32.149 --> 04:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
you know the mountain if the sun
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh goes behind the mountain at quarter
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
of three or three o'clock
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
that you're not going to be happy you
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
will not be pleased especially if you
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
were told
 
04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
this is somewhere that has a room so
 
04:17:45.359 --> 04:17:46.389 align:start position:0%
this is somewhere that has a room so
again

04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:17:49.349 --> 04:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
um i can't emphasize
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
how much planning can be done and
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
obviously we want to get the the b and
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
b's the airbnb the hotels everyone on
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
board one of the things that happens too
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
is prior to the event people come in
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
over the course of say a week
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
so you know there's people coming in
 
04:18:06.800 --> 04:18:07.910 align:start position:0%
so you know there's people coming in
slowly

04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
you're not stressing out the gas
 
04:18:11.830 --> 04:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
stations the restaurants the area
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
attractions then the event happens what
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
typically happens is
 
04:18:19.110 --> 04:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
five o'clock everyone goes okay that's
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
it do we have school tomorrow do we have
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
to work
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're out of here and it's akin to when
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
you land in an airplane and everyone
 
04:18:29.189 --> 04:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
hops up and then stands there for 20
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
minutes for many people it took an hour
 
04:18:34.630 --> 04:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
or two to get to the site of totality
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
and then it took anywhere from 12 to 24
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
hours to leave so we're going to be
 
04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to stay an extra day
 
04:18:45.349 --> 04:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
or two oh and while you're there why
 
04:18:47.429 --> 04:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
don't you check out some of our
 
04:18:50.070 --> 04:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
attractions and you're going to need to
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
eat and a place to stay for an extra day
 
04:18:55.590 --> 04:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
or two but we'll give you a deal so
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
all this requires just a tremendous
 
04:19:02.389 --> 04:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
amount of planning and i don't know if
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
laura it sounds like she's still
 
04:19:06.149 --> 04:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
on the phone
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're starting
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
ahead of time i think that was in the
 
04:19:12.630 --> 04:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
package not only do we have our event on
 
04:19:15.110 --> 04:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
monday april 8th 2024
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
but less than six months earlier on
 
04:19:20.950 --> 04:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
saturday october 14th 2023 there's a
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
second eclipse coming to the u.s

04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%

bill
 
04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
totally i'm working with rick ames and
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
i can share with you an event that
 
04:20:58.870 --> 04:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
happened in
 
04:20:58.880 --> 04:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
happened in
1994

04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
1994
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
may 10th
 
04:21:04.630 --> 04:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
i was in my classroom with my fifth
 
04:21:07.349 --> 04:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
grade and we had an annual eclipse that
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
went over plymouth new hampshire
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
and we had to stay indoors
 
04:21:12.239 --> 04:21:13.429 align:start position:0%
and we had to stay indoors
and

04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
look at a tv to enjoy that
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
so we need to be
 
04:21:20.830 --> 04:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
prepared ahead of time
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
and work with educating teachers
 
04:21:27.429 --> 04:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
and this is the most natural
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
stem event and we need to make it so
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
that students understand what's
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
happening and they're safe
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
and i'm presently working on
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
a book list four different book lists
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
for librarians and for different school
 
04:21:44.000 --> 04:21:45.030 align:start position:0%
for librarians and for different school
systems

04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:21:46.229 --> 04:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
and the first
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
book list will be for
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
young readers from zero age to ten
 
04:21:54.630 --> 04:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
the next will be middle school and high
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
school and then adult reading
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
and i hope to get those ready and
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
distribute those to help people
 
04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
understand and be educated and if you
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
think about it we need to have
 
04:22:06.960 --> 04:22:08.469 align:start position:0%
think about it we need to have
families

04:22:08.469 --> 04:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:22:08.479 --> 04:22:09.670 align:start position:0%
families
students

04:22:09.670 --> 04:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
communities understand our
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
earth moon system
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
if you think about our if we didn't have
 
04:22:17.830 --> 04:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
the moon our life would be really
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
different we'd have shorter days
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
the weather would be wild
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
we'd have
 
04:22:26.389 --> 04:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
no songs about the moon and there'd be
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
no honeymoons either
 
04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
so i just want to let you know that
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
i hope we can do this
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much miss jensen
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:13.990 --> 04:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
sean fargan you should be able to unmute
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
and speak to us
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much madam chair um
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to double back to uh
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
section one the my 603 song which uh i
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
think is an excellent song i uh
 
04:23:30.630 --> 04:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a it's perfect as is and
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
it should become another honorary state
 
04:23:34.389 --> 04:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
song there seems to be a lot of
 
04:23:36.309 --> 04:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
questions about the copyright i mean i'm
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
a creative person myself i don't know
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
all the ins and outs of it's probably a
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
songwriter probably knows more than i
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
did but there just seemed a little bit
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
of confusion during the discussion so
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
the way
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
first of all we've many of our honorary
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
state songs maybe all of them are
 
04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
already uh written by you know
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
by people who write songs for a living
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
like like mr murphy does including um
 
04:23:59.910 --> 04:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
including two very famous singer
 
04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
songwriters who recently passed away who
 
04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
used to be like used to live in the same
 
04:24:05.110 --> 04:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
community as me i'm not sure if they
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
were my constituents but uh the shaw
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
brothers who did a new hampshire
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
naturally so i don't
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's necessarily
 
04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's necessary and it
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
seems a little unfair to make her uh
 
04:24:18.149 --> 04:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
sign over the rights of the song and put
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
it to the public domain i think the way
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
it works um
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
we can just make it an honorary state
 
04:24:24.630 --> 04:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
song and she could still continue to
 
04:24:26.309 --> 04:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
collect small amount of royalties that
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
she gets when it's streamed or
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
somebody covers it on an alpha or never
 
04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
because like the way public performance
 
04:24:33.429 --> 04:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
works is
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
the venue is
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
if any was charged for it and then
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
the performing rights organizations
 
04:24:40.630 --> 04:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
including a tune for it but you heard
 
04:24:42.870 --> 04:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
about uh try to divvy
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
give it up which is kind of an exact
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
science but um so that's
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
how we should continue to do it i think
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
you should you may want to consult with
 
04:24:51.269 --> 04:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
the house counsel you may also want to
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
look back uh
 
04:24:55.990 --> 04:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah i think you
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
i i was i guess advice against uh asking
 
04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
her to sign away the rights to the song
 
04:25:03.349 --> 04:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
because i don't think that's necessary i
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
think she should continue to collect the
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
small amount of royalties that she's
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
getting from it so that's uh
 
04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative morgan and you should go
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
back and look at the the laws that were
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
passed in 1983
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire naturally was and
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
then 2007 when a song called live free
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
or died by barry palmer
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
sorry um no i just was uh raising my
 
04:25:39.750 --> 04:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
hand just in case um i needed to answer
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
a question um
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
so no i'm good unless to somebody who
 
04:25:46.870 --> 04:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
no i don't think so thank you
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
we grilled you pretty thoroughly the
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
first time
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i totally wasn't expecting all
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
those questions i guess i didn't really
 
04:25:58.229 --> 04:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
think about all those things
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
um i just honestly just wrote a song for
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i just wanted to share
 
04:26:02.239 --> 04:26:02.950 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i just wanted to share
it

04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:26:08.070 --> 04:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your having done so thank you
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
very much

and what she did has been done before so
 
04:26:13.120 --> 04:26:13.990 align:start position:0%
and what she did has been done before so
thanks

04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%

04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
for you for the chair is is that
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
something that pam can do a quick flip i
 
04:26:22.149 --> 04:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:26:23.590 --> 04:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
all right is there anyone else who
 
04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
all right see now i'm going to close the
 
04:26:34.070 --> 04:26:34.080 align:start position:0%

madam chair i have a question
oh

04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative schultz thank you um
 
04:26:47.110 --> 04:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
i think at our last exec session before
 
04:26:47.120 --> 04:26:48.469 align:start position:0%
i think at our last exec session before
lunchtime

04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
lunchtime
 
04:26:48.479 --> 04:26:49.670 align:start position:0%
lunchtime
um

04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
04:26:54.309 --> 04:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative schmidt was muted is
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.319 --> 04:27:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:27:01.110 --> 04:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:27:01.120 --> 04:27:05.189 align:start position:0%
i
i

04:27:05.189 --> 04:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:08.550 --> 04:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
i think he kind of ran out ran out
 
04:27:09.750 --> 04:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
here's why i'm bringing it up of course
 
04:27:15.510 --> 04:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know i was muted when i um
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
spoke during the executive session on hb
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
544 and i think i was muted
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
when questioning
 
04:27:24.000 --> 04:27:25.590 align:start position:0%
when questioning
um

04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
folks which i understand i would just
 
04:27:32.710 --> 04:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
like to say if he was muted he was um
 
04:27:35.110 --> 04:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
making a point about trump's handling of
 
04:27:35.120 --> 04:27:36.469 align:start position:0%
making a point about trump's handling of
covid

04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
covid
 
04:27:36.479 --> 04:27:37.429 align:start position:0%
covid
um

04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:39.429 --> 04:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
and of course we could disagree on
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
things about trump and that's
 
04:27:40.880 --> 04:27:42.469 align:start position:0%
things about trump and that's
understandable

04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
04:27:45.510 --> 04:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't it be better than muting
 
04:27:45.520 --> 04:27:46.389 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't it be better than muting
him

04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
doing as you do when we're all in the
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
room together
 
04:27:52.469 --> 04:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
which is um i don't remember if you
 
04:27:55.030 --> 04:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
exactly gavel or not but you do a good
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
job actually of explaining why
 
04:28:00.950 --> 04:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
um we veer off
 
04:28:03.910 --> 04:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever reason that you call us out
 
04:28:05.189 --> 04:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
of order
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then you give us a chance to finish
 
04:28:11.030 --> 04:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
what we were saying senator schultz
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
this is why
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
i muted him he was getting seriously off
 
04:28:16.159 --> 04:28:17.110 align:start position:0%
i muted him he was getting seriously off
track

04:28:17.110 --> 04:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
track
 
04:28:19.830 --> 04:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
i tried to gather him i tried to tell
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
him to focus on the bill and he would
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
not do so i was unable to reach get
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
through him on this interface
 
04:28:32.229 --> 04:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
so i muted him so that he would stop and
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
i was prepared to recognize him again to
 
04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
for him to complete his thoughts if he
 
04:28:42.309 --> 04:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
had not done so it's very difficult to
 
04:28:44.550 --> 04:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
get through to somebody on zoom to tell
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
them you're getting way off track you're
 
04:28:47.279 --> 04:28:48.469 align:start position:0%
them you're getting way off track you're
not

04:28:48.469 --> 04:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
talking about what we're here to talk
 
04:28:50.399 --> 04:28:51.750 align:start position:0%
talking about what we're here to talk
about

04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:28:51.760 --> 04:28:53.189 align:start position:0%
about
and

04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:53.199 --> 04:28:54.550 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
i know it is difficult because of the
 
04:28:56.800 --> 04:28:58.149 align:start position:0%
i know it is difficult because of the
separation

04:28:58.149 --> 04:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
separation
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
of those of us on zoom versus those of
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
us in the room
 
04:29:03.429 --> 04:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
04:29:03.439 --> 04:29:04.469 align:start position:0%
and i i
respect

04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
respect
 
04:29:07.110 --> 04:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
how you handled this for sure you know
 
04:29:08.790 --> 04:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
when we were all in person i wonder if
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
we can find
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
a new way to address this because i
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
don't even think representative schmidt
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
realized he was muted or i don't i
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
think i heard you
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
try to interrupt him i'm not so sure
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
that he heard you
 
04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i you know i wonder if we can find
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
a fairer way to notify
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
those of us on zoom if we if you are
 
04:29:35.189 --> 04:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
calling us out of order which is your
 
04:29:35.199 --> 04:29:36.469 align:start position:0%
calling us out of order which is your
right

04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that is
 
04:29:40.149 --> 04:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
or what it should be but i'm just
 
04:29:40.159 --> 04:29:41.510 align:start position:0%
or what it should be but i'm just
suggesting

04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe a different
 
04:29:43.760 --> 04:29:45.269 align:start position:0%
um maybe a different
approach

04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
approach
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you can come up with a way to get the
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
attention of someone who is in full
 
04:29:50.479 --> 04:29:52.309 align:start position:0%
attention of someone who is in full
spate

04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
spate
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
and not paying attention to
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
other voices or gavels or things like
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
that i would love to hear what your
 
04:29:59.680 --> 04:30:00.950 align:start position:0%
that i would love to hear what your
suggestion

04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
and i will implement it but until then
 
04:30:05.910 --> 04:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
the only thing i can do is to someone
 
04:30:07.349 --> 04:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
who is
 
04:30:09.429 --> 04:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
speaking at length on something that's
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
off topic
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
is to mute them and say and then go back
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
to them and say we shut you off and and
 
04:30:21.269 --> 04:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
ask if anybody needs to speak because
 
04:30:23.670 --> 04:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
we could spend all day list going off
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
topic and
 
04:30:28.170 --> 04:30:28.180 align:start position:0%
on many occasions we've we've come close
 
04:30:28.180 --> 04:30:29.269 align:start position:0%
on many occasions we've we've come close
[Music]

04:30:29.269 --> 04:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's fair i wonder if um while it
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
might be annoying for the folks in the
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
room with you
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
if maybe gaveling
 
04:30:40.550 --> 04:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
a few times would be helpful
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's the solution i'm
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
just suggesting it
 
04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i've i tried gambling you
 
04:30:50.469 --> 04:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
down just recently and you and you kept
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
right on going
 
04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
so it's it's clearly ineffective for
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
people who are not physically in the
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
room and will have to come up with a
 
04:31:01.110 --> 04:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
if you think of one let me know i'd love
 
04:31:05.349 --> 04:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
to hear it well hopefully we all get our
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
shots soon and can be in the same room
 
04:31:10.550 --> 04:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
by mid april i'll be in the room
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:31:14.309 --> 04:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
you've been very fair in explaining the
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
reasons you know in the past we've been
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
gaveled out and i've appreciated that
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
about you and i hope we can find
 
04:31:25.830 --> 04:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
a good approach to that that works for
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
everybody whatever that is i don't know
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
that we figured it out yet just making a
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
note of it
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:39.279 --> 04:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
do we want to exec senate bill 105 or do
 
04:31:53.429 --> 04:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
you want to get information on this
 
04:31:56.710 --> 04:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.870 --> 04:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay i've had at least one vote for
 
04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
getting information on the copyright no
 
04:32:00.960 --> 04:32:01.990 align:start position:0%
getting information on the copyright no
no

04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
what exactly oh
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
i would be interested in having you move
 
04:32:12.309 --> 04:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
your amendment
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
i would be interested in having you move
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:32:27.040 --> 04:32:28.710 align:start position:0%
but um
okay

04:32:28.710 --> 04:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:31.110 --> 04:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay it sounds like there is a uh
 
04:32:31.120 --> 04:32:32.229 align:start position:0%
okay it sounds like there is a uh
interest

04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:32:35.670 --> 04:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm here restlessly awaiting your
 
04:32:38.080 --> 04:32:42.550 align:start position:0%
i'm here restlessly awaiting your
decision

04:32:42.550 --> 04:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.480 --> 04:32:43.490 align:start position:0%
waiting what
 
04:32:43.490 --> 04:32:44.630 align:start position:0%
waiting what
[Music]

04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:32:46.229 --> 04:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
oh what
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there is at least some
 
04:32:49.830 --> 04:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh proceeding to exec
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
so we will do so rep representative roy
 
04:33:13.910 --> 04:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.920 --> 04:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry are we voting on a pass on the
 
04:33:20.879 --> 04:33:22.390 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry are we voting on a pass on the
uh

04:33:22.390 --> 04:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
representative roy very quietly and
 
04:33:27.910 --> 04:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
politely moved on to pass
 
04:33:27.920 --> 04:33:29.590 align:start position:0%
politely moved on to pass
second

04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
and this is what bill on the bill itself
 
04:33:37.109 --> 04:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:33:38.879 --> 04:33:41.029 align:start position:0%
is there a second
second

04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.269 --> 04:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative roy i do um
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's a rather um
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
easy bill uh the state's law enforcement
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate the work that this
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
citizen put into it i think that should
 
04:34:09.670 --> 04:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:12.310 --> 04:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cost the state anything we
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
have other state songs and this will
 
04:34:16.470 --> 04:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
just add to that and i think it's a it's
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
a good it's a good example of
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
civic involvement
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
where you apply your skills that are
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
best suited to you
 
04:34:27.029 --> 04:34:27.039 align:start position:0%
with regard to the um
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
metastatic breast cancer i think there
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
could never be too much awareness for
 
04:34:32.709 --> 04:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
that and again this is just an awareness
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
day it doesn't cost anything it's an
 
04:34:36.551 --> 04:34:36.561 align:start position:0%
official holiday or anything of that
 
04:34:36.561 --> 04:34:37.750 align:start position:0%
official holiday or anything of that
nature

04:34:37.750 --> 04:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
nature
 
04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
um so in the eclipse i mean just how
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
cool is that so i'm going to go ahead
 
04:34:44.551 --> 04:34:44.561 align:start position:0%
and move out the past
 
04:34:46.551 --> 04:34:46.561 align:start position:0%
all right you did representative schultz
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to yourself
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
yes isn't it fun when representative roy
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i agree and we agree
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
um we have already passed section three
 
04:35:00.390 --> 04:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
before i realize not everybody
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh was on this committee at that time
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
but we in the house did pass that before
 
04:35:04.639 --> 04:35:05.429 align:start position:0%
but we in the house did pass that before
and

04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
um i happen to know uh rick eames and
 
04:35:09.520 --> 04:35:10.310 align:start position:0%
um i happen to know uh rick eames and
his

04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
his
 
04:35:12.629 --> 04:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm is infectious
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
that both of the other two sections are
 
04:35:22.150 --> 04:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
um very good it is my understanding
 
04:35:22.160 --> 04:35:23.670 align:start position:0%
um very good it is my understanding
that

04:35:23.670 --> 04:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:25.429 --> 04:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
and i will say my knowledge of this is
 
04:35:25.439 --> 04:35:26.470 align:start position:0%
and i will say my knowledge of this is
limited

04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
limited
 
04:35:26.480 --> 04:35:27.269 align:start position:0%
limited
but

04:35:27.269 --> 04:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the way copyright
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
law works is
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
if you have representation and lawyers
 
04:35:38.230 --> 04:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
who push
 
04:35:40.470 --> 04:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing then it
 
04:35:42.390 --> 04:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
might be enforced to some degree but
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
she's already given us permission in her
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
testimony for anyone to use her song
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
with that with her permission i think
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
that is actually all you need
 
04:35:56.709 --> 04:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer uh but having worked at
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
churches where copyright is
 
04:36:01.990 --> 04:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually making sure your chorale and
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
your uh
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
sunday services are properly uh copy
 
04:36:06.799 --> 04:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
sunday services are properly uh copy
written

04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:36:10.869 --> 04:36:10.879 align:start position:0%
uh that process is taken very seriously
 
04:36:13.269 --> 04:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
and i think you literally only need the
 
04:36:15.670 --> 04:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
permission of the songwriter i might be
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
wrong on that but i'm fairly certain
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
04:36:18.959 --> 04:36:19.750 align:start position:0%
that's the case
um

04:36:19.750 --> 04:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:24.070 --> 04:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
i think all three sections are um
 
04:36:27.670 --> 04:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
great and i hope that we can agree on
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
this on the bus bill thank you great
 
04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
representative schuett you have a
 
04:36:32.959 --> 04:36:34.470 align:start position:0%
representative schuett you have a
comment

04:36:34.470 --> 04:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
comment
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:36:38.070 --> 04:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
actually i guess
 
04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
a comment and a question
 
04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
question of the chair first
 
04:36:42.240 --> 04:36:43.269 align:start position:0%
question of the chair first
um

04:36:43.269 --> 04:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
if we just do ought to pass then you are
 
04:36:48.709 --> 04:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
not going to bring your amendments on
 
04:36:51.750 --> 04:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is that correct
 
04:36:51.760 --> 04:36:54.230 align:start position:0%
this bill is that correct
i'm

04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.750 --> 04:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh that is the motion if
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
while we're discussing it i might move
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
either of them
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
the point is that i
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
personally fully support
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse day i don't really
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
care about the saints song and i
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
kind of think
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
another cancer awareness day seems
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
redundant because it's
 
04:37:20.949 --> 04:37:20.959 align:start position:0%
it's more effective if the
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
the cancer group
 
04:37:24.789 --> 04:37:24.799 align:start position:0%
each year petitions the governor because
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
it keeps them involved we've opposed
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
special days for that reason
 
04:37:30.480 --> 04:37:31.670 align:start position:0%
special days for that reason
but

04:37:31.670 --> 04:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not opposed enough to fight the
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:38.949 --> 04:37:38.959 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:37:38.959 --> 04:37:40.070 align:start position:0%
thank you um
follow-up

04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes just a suggestion to um
 
04:37:45.990 --> 04:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative roy if if this motion
 
04:37:46.000 --> 04:37:47.429 align:start position:0%
representative roy if if this motion
prevails

04:37:47.429 --> 04:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
prevails
 
04:37:50.070 --> 04:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh to be sure and
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
state in the blurb which will establish
 
04:37:56.789 --> 04:37:56.799 align:start position:0%
legislative intent ms murphy's remarks
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
that she does
 
04:38:01.269 --> 04:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
give unequivocal permission
 
04:38:05.189 --> 04:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.199 --> 04:38:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
the issue about the song hasn't been
 
04:38:17.189 --> 04:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
resolved i will not be voting for this
 
04:38:17.199 --> 04:38:18.709 align:start position:0%
resolved i will not be voting for this
um

04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:18.719 --> 04:38:19.990 align:start position:0%
um
bill

04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:38:21.510 --> 04:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
i would rather support what your
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that just includes the number
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
three the solar eclipse day that's the
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
only thing that i'm interested in at the
 
04:38:28.240 --> 04:38:29.029 align:start position:0%
only thing that i'm interested in at the
time

04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:38:30.789 --> 04:38:30.799 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to let you know
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:38:38.629 --> 04:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:41.590 --> 04:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too will be
 
04:38:44.789 --> 04:38:44.799 align:start position:0%
voting against this motion hoping that
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh your amendment will be brought
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
forward for just uh
 
04:38:50.830 --> 04:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse day um
 
04:38:50.840 --> 04:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse day um
i

04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
told the members of this committee
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
before my stance is on continuing to
 
04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
name days as we get
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
five or six of those bills every year
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
and it's just
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelming as we go on and i think it
 
04:39:04.709 --> 04:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
dilutes the purpose
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
um for that reason i won't support this
 
04:39:08.629 --> 04:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
motion and hopefully
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh support your amendment coming forward
 
04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fontenot
 
04:39:16.310 --> 04:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and it's a
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
question i guess and maybe i should have
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
asked it earlier but um
 
04:39:20.400 --> 04:39:22.150 align:start position:0%
asked it earlier but um
clarification

04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:39:24.310 --> 04:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
i was concerned about the song when i
 
04:39:27.269 --> 04:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
was thinking it was being named the
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
state song
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
but apparently
 
04:39:32.629 --> 04:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
it's just a
 
04:39:35.830 --> 04:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
state song uh to be shared with numerous
 
04:39:37.590 --> 04:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
others i i guess i don't know what the
 
04:39:39.670 --> 04:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
difference is and maybe somebody on the
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee can
 
04:39:44.310 --> 04:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
other songs that are labeled as
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
as state songs at the moment
 
04:39:47.520 --> 04:39:48.470 align:start position:0%
as state songs at the moment
so

04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of rare it's an honorary
 
04:39:50.878 --> 04:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of rare it's an honorary
title

04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
title
 
04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
so i would have no opposition to it in
 
04:39:54.480 --> 04:39:56.070 align:start position:0%
so i would have no opposition to it in
that

04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
04:39:58.560 --> 04:40:01.030 align:start position:0%
in that case
representative

04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
um allegra you uh i would uh i could
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
address the whole bill
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit later uh as we move on but
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
i want to address a couple of the
 
04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
elements of it
 
04:40:14.470 --> 04:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
i was just about to say we already have
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
a states on and there are i guess
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere between eight and ten
 
04:40:22.150 --> 04:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
that receive honorable mention
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
our current state zone which is old new
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire actually
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
talks about lakes fields forest rivers
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
rails and so again it touches on the
 
04:40:34.390 --> 04:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
natural aspects of new hampshire
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's another aspect which
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
makes it a little bit more difficult for
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
me yet what happens
 
04:40:43.590 --> 04:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
when area codes are no longer in use or
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
when new hampshire splits into two area
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
codes which is inevitable
 
04:40:51.910 --> 04:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
well i'll just uh
 
04:40:56.788 --> 04:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that for that bill
 
04:41:00.150 --> 04:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
breast cancer awareness we just have
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
in spite of what some people might
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
suggest we have tremendous
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh efforts going on around the country
 
04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the state for breast cancer awareness
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
and then also often the other comments
 
04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
for a little bit later if the
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
um i agree with the others who uh
 
04:41:23.750 --> 04:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
support part three i see the solar
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
eclipse day more as a economic
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
development thing than anything else
 
04:41:31.190 --> 04:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
you know i agree that
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
i mean there are many
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
diseases cancers that are fatal
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
and all of them could use additional
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:44.628 --> 04:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
there's a power to tremendous publicity
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
about breast cancer i mean maybe they
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
could work in that community to get a
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
particular the metastatic thing
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
recognized more
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
think we have some concerns with the
 
04:41:56.708 --> 04:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
copyright issue in the state so
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i'd prefer the amendment that
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
governor wanted to all right
 
04:42:04.470 --> 04:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i have some
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
reservations with regard
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
the song aspect um
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
although she seemed quite open to
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
letting us use it and so forth she
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
seemed quite uncertain about several
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
aspects of it uh and i i think we would
 
04:42:24.480 --> 04:42:25.270 align:start position:0%
aspects of it uh and i i think we would
be

04:42:25.270 --> 04:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
remiss in our responsibility if we
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
didn't check with uh
 
04:42:29.280 --> 04:42:30.628 align:start position:0%
didn't check with uh
uh

04:42:30.628 --> 04:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
house attorney or someone to see what
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
the law is
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
as harmless as as it might seem to the
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
degree with that we jump in on something
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
where we
 
04:42:47.670 --> 04:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
inadvertently goof it up
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
just for lack of a little bit of
 
04:42:49.440 --> 04:42:50.390 align:start position:0%
just for lack of a little bit of
foresight

04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
foresight
 
04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh would be a shame because i haven't
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
had a chance to hear this song i agree
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
with representative allegra that that uh
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
my 603 i thought right off the bat we
 
04:43:02.550 --> 04:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
all almost split up already and i think
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's inevitable that we will um and
 
04:43:05.760 --> 04:43:06.550 align:start position:0%
it's inevitable that we will um and
so

04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:08.070 --> 04:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's there are a couple of aspects
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
there uh so i think that um
 
04:43:14.230 --> 04:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly in favor of alerting the
 
04:43:14.240 --> 04:43:15.190 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly in favor of alerting the
public

04:43:15.190 --> 04:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
and the uh the
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
the economy
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is of the solar eclipse is
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to be enormous
 
04:43:24.080 --> 04:43:25.350 align:start position:0%
going to be enormous
um

04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:27.510 --> 04:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to have thousands of people
 
04:43:30.550 --> 04:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
who are going to regret if they got into
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
it too late just for lack of information
 
04:43:36.230 --> 04:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
so we should absolutely pass that the
 
04:43:38.948 --> 04:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
other stuff i've spoken to thank you
 
04:43:38.958 --> 04:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
other stuff i've spoken to thank you
representative

04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this is um
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
i guess in the guise of a parliamentary
 
04:43:46.958 --> 04:43:49.350 align:start position:0%
i guess in the guise of a parliamentary
inquiry

04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
if ought to pass fails
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
then the bill would not be subject to
 
04:43:58.830 --> 04:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative i would as soon as the
 
04:44:03.670 --> 04:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
last person which was yourself had
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
spoken i was about to move the amendment
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:13.510 --> 04:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:15.430 --> 04:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
seeing only people who have spoken
 
04:44:15.440 --> 04:44:16.708 align:start position:0%
seeing only people who have spoken
before

04:44:16.708 --> 04:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
i i move amendment 0901
 
04:44:20.798 --> 04:44:22.150 align:start position:0%
i i move amendment 0901
h

04:44:22.150 --> 04:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
h
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
which deletes sections 1 and 2.
 
04:44:29.670 --> 04:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
is there a second oh second
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.080 --> 04:44:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
well we have roy and schultz already
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
i prepared this because just looking at
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm as representative goalie is i'm
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about announcing
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
special days when we already have so
 
04:45:01.910 --> 04:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.920 --> 04:45:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
remember the time when we had a hearing
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
on a special day that happened to occur
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
on congenital heart disease day
 
04:45:13.110 --> 04:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
february 14th by the way and nobody in
 
04:45:17.590 --> 04:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
the committee or the sponsors of the
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
bill knew that that was a special day so
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
i'm convinced that
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
asking the governor to announce a
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
special day is more useful
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
than uh
 
04:45:32.230 --> 04:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
than putting it into statute can be
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
quietly forgotten
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the song
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
breaks on lovely we've got 10 already
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
of the need so
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm moving this amendment
 
04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.708 --> 04:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well the thing is
 
04:45:58.708 --> 04:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know the lyrics i don't know the
 
04:46:08.868 --> 04:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
melody uh and
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i i would hate to dismiss the offer
 
04:46:13.510 --> 04:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
out of hand
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
until i've heard it until what we've
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
checked and and checked on the
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
the copyright aspect of it uh so
 
04:46:24.480 --> 04:46:26.948 align:start position:0%
the copyright aspect of it uh so
um

04:46:26.948 --> 04:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
that that i think because the amendment
 
04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
dismisses the song
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
in its
 
04:46:36.628 --> 04:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
application as as the bill suggests
 
04:46:39.990 --> 04:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
so i won't vote for the amendment but uh
 
04:46:42.390 --> 04:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think we're going at it
 
04:46:42.400 --> 04:46:44.948 align:start position:0%
i think we're going at it
um

04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think we're going at it wrong
 
04:46:49.430 --> 04:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
senator roy
 
04:46:50.628 --> 04:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:50.638 --> 04:46:52.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:46:52.390 --> 04:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:53.670 --> 04:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to the song
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
we have a citizen in new hampshire who
 
04:47:01.750 --> 04:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated some time and energy
 
04:47:04.950 --> 04:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
is willing to donate a song that that's
 
04:47:04.960 --> 04:47:06.310 align:start position:0%
is willing to donate a song that that's
[Music]

04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:09.110 --> 04:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
to be used as one of our songs the
 
04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
governor's already shown an interest in
 
04:47:10.798 --> 04:47:11.150 align:start position:0%
governor's already shown an interest in
it

04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:47:11.160 --> 04:47:13.190 align:start position:0%
it
[Music]

04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that this type of creativity
 
04:47:17.690 --> 04:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
should be encouraged by the legislature
 
04:47:17.700 --> 04:47:19.030 align:start position:0%
should be encouraged by the legislature
[Music]

04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:19.040 --> 04:47:21.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
furthermore

04:47:21.430 --> 04:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
it does not hurt to feature
 
04:47:23.760 --> 04:47:24.868 align:start position:0%
it does not hurt to feature
our

04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:47:26.480 --> 04:47:26.490 align:start position:0%
our artistic
 
04:47:26.490 --> 04:47:28.830 align:start position:0%
our artistic
[Music]

04:47:28.830 --> 04:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
citizens it's just it's another good
 
04:47:33.270 --> 04:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
thing to show that new hampshire you
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
know produces we have artists we have
 
04:47:38.708 --> 04:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
painters we have songwriters so there's
 
04:47:40.550 --> 04:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with featuring one it
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt anybody to add it to the
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
list of songs however many they may be
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's comes down to just a matter of
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
principle either being for or against
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that when we're talking
 
04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
about one of our fellow citizens it
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt to be four
 
04:47:56.470 --> 04:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to the breast cancer
 
04:48:00.070 --> 04:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
awareness day again this is i i am
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
totally on board with we should not be
 
04:48:04.628 --> 04:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
having all a list of holidays
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
but as far as days where we
 
04:48:09.910 --> 04:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
call awareness to something
 
04:48:09.920 --> 04:48:11.110 align:start position:0%
call awareness to something
again

04:48:11.110 --> 04:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
there's only upside to to this
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
particular one we're talking about a
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
horrific disease
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
and to be able to just bring attention
 
04:48:20.550 --> 04:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
to it one day i don't again there's no
 
04:48:20.560 --> 04:48:21.510 align:start position:0%
to it one day i don't again there's no
cost

04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's no infringement on rights i
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
don't see how it
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
that does anything negative so
 
04:48:31.670 --> 04:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:33.830 --> 04:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative pearson thank
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
you very much i believe the
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
kirkwood family i believe in the
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given in reference to
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
october 13th as metastatic breast cancer
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
awareness day the the person who
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
presented indicated that that was
 
04:48:48.550 --> 04:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
already recognized in federal law as the
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
day so
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
i just don't see the necessary
 
04:48:53.270 --> 04:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
redundancy there
 
04:48:54.868 --> 04:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
and i i would agree with representative
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
goalie on on his points when it comes to
 
04:48:57.280 --> 04:48:58.948 align:start position:0%
goalie on on his points when it comes to
uh

04:48:58.948 --> 04:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:00.788 --> 04:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
the plethora of days that we are asked
 
04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
to to
 
04:49:03.990 --> 04:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
put into a dusty lava
 
04:49:09.080 --> 04:49:09.090 align:start position:0%

much there yeah you'll have to get
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
closer to a uh

200 foundation
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
pull that one over
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm voting against the bill
 
04:49:32.718 --> 04:49:34.070 align:start position:0%
so i'm voting against the bill
right

04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
right

thank you i support this amendment
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
although the other issues are important
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe that we need another
 
04:50:04.080 --> 04:50:05.030 align:start position:0%
um i don't believe that we need another

04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
song
 
04:50:07.030 --> 04:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
i also um
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe that um help having
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
metastatic cancer day is going to do
 
04:50:11.600 --> 04:50:12.868 align:start position:0%
metastatic cancer day is going to do
anything

04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
to the organization i think that
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
you know if we want to um address these
 
04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
issues there are many issues many health
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
issues i think we need to address them
 
04:50:27.670 --> 04:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
in a more significant way
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i still think that the solar eclipse
 
04:50:30.000 --> 04:50:31.030 align:start position:0%
so i still think that the solar eclipse
day

04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
does bring revenue to the state so i'll
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
be voting for the amendment and i thank
 
04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
you for submitting it
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.520 --> 04:50:46.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:50:46.708 --> 04:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:50.948 --> 04:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
i i i'm not quite sure how to say this
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
but i just want to point out
 
04:50:53.200 --> 04:50:54.310 align:start position:0%
but i just want to point out
that

04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:56.390 --> 04:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
these this this
 
04:50:59.350 --> 04:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
more staunch stand on being against
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
naming days i hear your reasons
 
04:51:05.110 --> 04:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
but unless you ban them from being
 
04:51:05.120 --> 04:51:06.788 align:start position:0%
but unless you ban them from being
introduced

04:51:06.788 --> 04:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
04:51:08.948 --> 04:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
they'll keep coming up
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to ban that
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
um it takes as much time to vote for it
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
as it does to vote against it
 
04:51:16.958 --> 04:51:17.990 align:start position:0%
as it does to vote against it
so

04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
if they've taken the time to file the
 
04:51:22.470 --> 04:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
bill because one of their constituents
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
or people that they work with on these
 
04:51:24.160 --> 04:51:25.510 align:start position:0%
or people that they work with on these
issues

04:51:25.510 --> 04:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:51:27.990 --> 04:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
are asking for this to be recognized by
 
04:51:29.830 --> 04:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
and it costs nothing and it's not
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
harmful all the other things you say
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
about it are also true
 
04:51:38.470 --> 04:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
with the you know there's a federal
 
04:51:41.190 --> 04:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
recognition too that's not a problem i
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
mean there's no harm in doing it
 
04:51:43.280 --> 04:51:44.628 align:start position:0%
mean there's no harm in doing it
whatsoever

04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
04:51:47.190 --> 04:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
none and it's a positive
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
thing to provide
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
the average citizen who otherwise may
 
04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
not be engaged in civic uh in the civic
 
04:51:57.430 --> 04:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
arena and anything else
 
04:51:57.440 --> 04:51:58.868 align:start position:0%
arena and anything else
um

04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
i just find this
 
04:52:02.550 --> 04:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
it feels kind of new to me the way that
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
there's this
 
04:52:04.708 --> 04:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
um stand to just be against all of them
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
i would like to see a more positive
 
04:52:12.718 --> 04:52:14.628 align:start position:0%
i would like to see a more positive
attitude

04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
attitude
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
um towards civic engagement just
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
to dismiss that i believe is is the
 
04:52:20.878 --> 04:52:22.070 align:start position:0%
to dismiss that i believe is is the
wrong

04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:52:25.510 --> 04:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
um approach
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
i will be supporting the amendment i
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
tend to agree
 
04:52:39.990 --> 04:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
that i'm not in favor of putting a lot
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
more things into statute
 
04:52:45.670 --> 04:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
particularly the breast cancer
 
04:52:45.680 --> 04:52:46.948 align:start position:0%
particularly the breast cancer
item

04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
item
 
04:52:50.310 --> 04:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
i'm very sympathetic to that cause
 
04:52:52.550 --> 04:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
relate to the american cancer society
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
every year
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
my mother passed away from
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
pancreatic cancer so i'm very
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to that cause but i do know
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
that the american cancer society itself
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
fights for all different
 
04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
aspects of cancer and as representative
 
04:53:12.798 --> 04:53:13.750 align:start position:0%
aspects of cancer and as representative

04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
as representative pearson pointed out
 
04:53:38.390 --> 04:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
there is
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
a national recognition day
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure the governor will support
 
04:53:46.628 --> 04:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
recognizing that without having to put
 
04:53:49.110 --> 04:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
that in statute
 
04:53:51.030 --> 04:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i definitely
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
supporting the eclipse day
 
04:53:57.670 --> 04:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
and that does not go into statute
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
representative phillips
 
04:54:06.788 --> 04:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm 110
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
in favor of this amendment
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the same reasons that i supported
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
the solar eclipse bill last time we
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
heard it it's great for tourism and it's
 
04:54:17.910 --> 04:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
also a
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity because it'll be
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
during the day i mean kids can
 
04:54:24.550 --> 04:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
well maybe they'll be on their way home
 
04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
but kids kids can learn about this
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
i have concerns about the song the
 
04:54:33.510 --> 04:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
copyright's one issue the other issue is
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
as representative allegro said you know
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we won't always be this just this
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
zip code and if if
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned about the fact that
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
promoting somebody's
 
04:54:45.840 --> 04:54:47.030 align:start position:0%
promoting somebody's
song

04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
song
 
04:54:50.310 --> 04:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
could generate revenues for them
 
04:54:52.868 --> 04:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
and that if we go start to go down that
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
road we will have more
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
people asking us to
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
adopt their songs
 
04:55:02.708 --> 04:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say thank you
 
04:55:02.718 --> 04:55:05.190 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have to say thank you
representative

04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:55:05.200 --> 04:55:06.470 align:start position:0%
representative
uh

04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear you it's in september
 
04:55:16.948 --> 04:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative schultz one of there
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
is a downside and that's that we become
 
04:55:19.760 --> 04:55:21.270 align:start position:0%
is a downside and that's that we become
anesthetized

04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
anesthetized
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
to these things here's what we do with
 
04:55:25.830 --> 04:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
state reps
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
with respect to breast cancer
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
salem dairy has a relay for life
 
04:55:34.230 --> 04:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the cancer society i've
 
04:55:36.788 --> 04:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
been going every year they've had it as
 
04:55:38.470 --> 04:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
state reps who are people in the
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
community we should talk it up with our
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
local papers and just talk it up show up
 
04:55:47.510 --> 04:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
be there at the relay for life you want
 
04:55:50.070 --> 04:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
to do something that's real that that's
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
my vote
 
04:55:51.840 --> 04:55:52.628 align:start position:0%
my vote
and

04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:55:55.110 --> 04:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
the rest i'm not in favor of really any
 
04:55:57.670 --> 04:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
of this because by the way stakes on
 
04:55:59.110 --> 04:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
don't play it if you're not worried
 
04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
about copyright uh solar eclipse it's a
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
great idea but that's what the chamber
 
04:56:05.910 --> 04:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
of commerce is about you're not the
 
04:56:08.310 --> 04:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce and i just don't
 
04:56:10.150 --> 04:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
want the additional
 
04:56:10.160 --> 04:56:11.750 align:start position:0%
want the additional
clutter

04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
clutter
 
04:56:11.760 --> 04:56:12.628 align:start position:0%
clutter
uh

04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:15.670 --> 04:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
so well it's not harmful it's not
 
04:56:18.310 --> 04:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
helpful either i'm done
 
04:56:18.320 --> 04:56:20.550 align:start position:0%
helpful either i'm done
simple

04:56:20.550 --> 04:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
simple
 
04:56:22.470 --> 04:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for recognizing
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
me representative scitec stole my line
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
which was a central issue for me
 
04:56:29.110 --> 04:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
i look on my shoulder and there's a
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
shelf with just thousands and thousands
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
of rsas
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that the solar eclipse thing
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
is a tremendous business development
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity but it should be handled by
 
04:56:40.708 --> 04:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
the chamber of commerce and other
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
business development agencies in the
 
04:56:42.400 --> 04:56:43.430 align:start position:0%
business development agencies in the
state

04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:56:46.788 --> 04:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:48.868 --> 04:56:48.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not strongly in favor of the
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
amendment at all
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
i want to say i also agree with
 
04:56:55.110 --> 04:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative cellos during the
 
04:56:55.120 --> 04:56:57.190 align:start position:0%
representative cellos during the
testimony

04:56:57.190 --> 04:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
on state song
 
04:57:01.030 --> 04:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
i couldn't help but be concerned that
 
04:57:03.110 --> 04:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is really a
 
04:57:05.830 --> 04:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for the songwriter as
 
04:57:08.180 --> 04:57:08.190 align:start position:0%
much as it was anything else um
 
04:57:08.190 --> 04:57:10.150 align:start position:0%
much as it was anything else um
[Music]

04:57:10.150 --> 04:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:57:12.550 --> 04:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
and that that was just my opinion
 
04:57:14.628 --> 04:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
i just we have so many laws and
 
04:57:17.520 --> 04:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
i just we have so many laws and
and

04:57:18.120 --> 04:57:18.130 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:18.130 --> 04:57:19.590 align:start position:0%
and

04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going to enjoy and
 
04:57:23.320 --> 04:57:23.330 align:start position:0%
be present and
 
04:57:23.330 --> 04:57:24.550 align:start position:0%
be present and
[Music]

04:57:24.550 --> 04:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
doing things on solar eclipse day no
 
04:57:26.638 --> 04:57:28.310 align:start position:0%
doing things on solar eclipse day no
doubt

04:57:28.310 --> 04:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
but i just don't think we need yet
 
04:57:30.160 --> 04:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
but i just don't think we need yet
another

04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
law in this area
 
04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:38.948 --> 04:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
that's actually not a new statute it's a
 
04:57:40.708 --> 04:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
session one i'm sorry
 
04:57:42.550 --> 04:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's not a new statute it's just
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
session one
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
it disappears it disappears yes
 
04:57:47.520 --> 04:57:51.910 align:start position:0%
it disappears it disappears yes
representative

04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.750 --> 04:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i'll be brief
 
04:57:53.760 --> 04:57:56.070 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i'll be brief
um

04:57:56.070 --> 04:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
establishing a state song as
 
04:58:01.990 --> 04:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh six of my 603 as a state song
 
04:58:03.910 --> 04:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
like we said there's already a number of
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
them on the books and i don't think uh
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
at least i don't believe anyone
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
on this could state all of them that are
 
04:58:13.910 --> 04:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
listed currently
 
04:58:13.920 --> 04:58:15.750 align:start position:0%
listed currently
[Music]

04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:58:20.550 --> 04:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
and as of naming october 13th i i think
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
we already recognize
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
the month of october as breast cancer
 
04:58:27.190 --> 04:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
awareness month i think we've all worn
 
04:58:29.510 --> 04:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
either a pink ribbon or something pink
 
04:58:31.030 --> 04:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
during the month
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
a whole month of october and to add
 
04:58:34.708 --> 04:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
another day
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
specifically for a specific
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
breast cancer i think
 
04:58:40.550 --> 04:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
those individuals
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
have that ability during that month
 
04:58:45.910 --> 04:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
to get their point across as to the
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
different kinds of breast cancer that
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
are out there
 
04:58:51.270 --> 04:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
um without having to have a specific day
 
04:58:52.550 --> 04:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
during the month
 
04:58:53.830 --> 04:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
for that reason i'll support your
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and uh that's all i have to
 
04:58:57.750 --> 04:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
say thank you
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to support the amendment i
 
04:59:04.150 --> 04:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
think there's one more element to
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
solar eclipse state beyond just an
 
04:59:07.510 --> 04:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
economic drive and that is a
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
an educational
 
04:59:12.070 --> 04:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
um driver then in the schools i i happen
 
04:59:13.030 --> 04:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
yeah this would be shocking i happen to
 
04:59:17.670 --> 04:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
be a senior in high school the last time
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
this happened in 1994 and uh recall all
 
04:59:23.350 --> 04:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
of the things that occurred at pinkerton
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
academy um in reference to that day and
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
what we did so i
 
04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know i don't want the the
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
educational aspect of this lost lost in
 
04:59:34.150 --> 04:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
the discussion as well so i'll be
 
04:59:34.160 --> 04:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
the discussion as well so i'll be
supporting

04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
04:59:40.708 --> 04:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
um i just feel like first of all i have
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
a question uh did i see correctly that
 
04:59:47.910 --> 04:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
this omnibus legislation passed the
 
04:59:53.430 --> 04:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.430 --> 04:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's very likely yes
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
i did and i i get that we can you know
 
05:00:01.270 --> 05:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
kill anything the senate gives us
 
05:00:01.280 --> 05:00:02.150 align:start position:0%
kill anything the senate gives us
and

05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:03.510 --> 05:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know there's a reason why these
 
05:00:03.520 --> 05:00:05.110 align:start position:0%
you know there's a reason why these
senators

05:00:05.110 --> 05:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
senators
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
brought this to us
 
05:00:07.200 --> 05:00:09.910 align:start position:0%
brought this to us
um

05:00:09.910 --> 05:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
having a hard time expressing my
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
frustration other than to say
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that they took the time to file

in that case perhaps we can go on to
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:55.190 --> 05:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think we got any of that
 
05:09:55.200 --> 05:09:57.750 align:start position:0%
i don't think we got any of that
representatives

05:09:57.750 --> 05:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
of not having voted the ought to pass
 
05:10:03.270 --> 05:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
before voting on the
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
amendment but we never vote on what to
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
yes the parliamentary procedure is that
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
someone has to has to
 
05:10:27.030 --> 05:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
essentially move ought to pass and then
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
move the amendment
 
05:10:31.910 --> 05:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
normally it's not a full motion on the
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:10:33.360 --> 05:10:34.868 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
because

05:10:34.868 --> 05:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:10:37.590 --> 05:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment is part of it in this case
 
05:10:40.628 --> 05:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment came out because the
 
05:10:40.638 --> 05:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
the amendment came out because the
uh

05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
because the discussion on the bill
 
05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
revealed that there are many people
 
05:10:49.430 --> 05:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about it and therefore an
 
05:10:51.990 --> 05:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment was
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
legitimate perhaps we should should have
 
05:10:57.190 --> 05:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
voted on the ought to pass before we
 
05:10:58.708 --> 05:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
took up the amendment
 
05:11:00.470 --> 05:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not objecting it's just that i have
 
05:11:02.230 --> 05:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
to write another piece of paper that's
 
05:11:02.240 --> 05:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
to write another piece of paper that's
all

05:11:03.030 --> 05:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:11:04.630 --> 05:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'm terribly sorry
 
05:11:04.640 --> 05:11:11.350 align:start position:0%
i'm terribly sorry

05:11:59.190 --> 05:11:59.200 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:12:21.750 --> 05:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:23.190 --> 05:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on this
 
05:12:23.200 --> 05:12:29.590 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on this
amendment

05:12:29.590 --> 05:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.150 --> 05:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
i can say that um excuse me i can say
 
05:12:36.310 --> 05:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
that um this amendment clarifies the um
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
earlier amendment
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
involving the house of representatives
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
and the senate with on the committee
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
and that that is addressed in paragraph
 
05:12:50.470 --> 05:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
eight on page one of the amendment
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
so i think this amendment addresses the
 
05:12:54.550 --> 05:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that the committee had
 
05:12:57.990 --> 05:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
with the original house bill 187 excuse
 
05:13:00.390 --> 05:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
me of uh representative lucas i didn't
 
05:13:00.400 --> 05:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
me of uh representative lucas i didn't
realize

05:13:01.670 --> 05:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
realize
 
05:13:03.510 --> 05:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
until i started speaking that perhaps
 
05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
you want to say something
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
well you you made the motion so you get
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
to speak first
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
president pearson do you have anything
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
to add uh well you know uh the
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment that i withdrew we
 
05:13:19.110 --> 05:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
discussed and uh
 
05:13:20.470 --> 05:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
and that later brought us into the
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on the the first part of this
 
05:13:22.320 --> 05:13:24.948 align:start position:0%
discussion on the the first part of this
so

05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:26.960 --> 05:13:26.970 align:start position:0%
reading through it it looks like uh
 
05:13:26.970 --> 05:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
reading through it it looks like uh
[Music]

05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:13:31.350 --> 05:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
to put it in plain english he did what
 
05:13:34.788 --> 05:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think that that's you know certainly
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
up for discussion but i'm i'm happy with
 
05:13:41.590 --> 05:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
it representative lucas do you have a
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
comment uh i just had a question and and
 
05:13:46.310 --> 05:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
i expected the sponsors are the people
 
05:13:49.830 --> 05:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
moving the amount to speak first so not
 
05:13:51.030 --> 05:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
a problem at all
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
um is this basically some of the process
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh for java cars if they object to a
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
rule yes
 
05:13:59.040 --> 05:14:00.628 align:start position:0%
rule yes
yes

05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
they can review and discuss and advise
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
the commission the commissioner in this
 
05:14:05.440 --> 05:14:06.390 align:start position:0%
the commission the commissioner in this
case

05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
no problem
 
05:14:07.760 --> 05:14:08.948 align:start position:0%
no problem
but

05:14:08.948 --> 05:14:08.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
in order to actually block it they need
 
05:14:14.070 --> 05:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
to get the full legislative legislature
 
05:14:14.080 --> 05:14:15.190 align:start position:0%
to get the full legislative legislature
behind

05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
behind
 
05:14:18.150 --> 05:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
so yes they sponsor a resolution
 
05:14:20.708 --> 05:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
and to rescind her okay
 
05:14:23.110 --> 05:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
um follow-up fellow
 
05:14:24.948 --> 05:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
yeah i uh
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
you know i kind of prefer i did prefer
 
05:14:26.958 --> 05:14:27.910 align:start position:0%
you know i kind of prefer i did prefer
what

05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
the bill was doing and it was doing
 
05:14:29.920 --> 05:14:31.030 align:start position:0%
the bill was doing and it was doing
originally

05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
originally
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
but if there is actually a rules problem
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%

that the

05:15:02.628 --> 05:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
because the commissioner's order until

that
discussion

05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%

05:15:38.150 --> 05:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
there are serious
 
05:15:38.160 --> 05:15:39.670 align:start position:0%

have it on wednesday
 
05:21:51.270 --> 05:21:51.280 align:start position:0%

05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
senate bills
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
if we can
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
vote on any of them it's a plus
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
if we can't
 
05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's that time
 
05:22:13.920 --> 05:22:14.948 align:start position:0%
it's that time
so

05:22:14.948 --> 05:22:14.958 align:start position:0%

presumably it's a question uh madam
chair

05:22:27.910 --> 05:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:22:31.510 --> 05:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh 141 and 417 is that is that the
 
05:22:33.350 --> 05:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
remaining work we have that's the
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
remaining house bills
 
05:22:38.070 --> 05:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
as far as my records are are set
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
up i will be checking with the
 
05:22:42.550 --> 05:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
with our
 
05:22:44.070 --> 05:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee assistant to make sure i
 
05:22:44.080 --> 05:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
committee assistant to make sure i
haven't

05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:55.590 --> 05:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
yes just to
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
am i correct in assuming that uh
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
even though we will be executing some
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
senate bills that they would not be on
 
05:23:06.788 --> 05:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
the calendar in our three
 
05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
session days in april is that
 
05:23:09.200 --> 05:23:11.350 align:start position:0%
session days in april is that
likely

05:23:11.350 --> 05:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
likely
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
my thought is that if they are on
 
05:23:16.550 --> 05:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
consent they might very well go on the
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
calendar if they are not on consent
 
05:23:22.708 --> 05:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
they will probably not
 
05:23:25.270 --> 05:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that insight
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
even if they decided to i mean on the
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
senate bill part but just don't get to
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
it yeah and even if they were on the
 
05:23:37.200 --> 05:23:38.390 align:start position:0%
it yeah and even if they were on the
calendar

05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
they they could be easily special
 
05:23:42.868 --> 05:23:42.878 align:start position:0%
ordered to the end
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
and if we don't get to them there's no
 
05:23:44.638 --> 05:23:48.150 align:start position:0%
and if we don't get to them there's no
deadline

05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:52.708 --> 05:23:52.718 align:start position:0%
