00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
all right good morning everyone
 
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
all right so um yeah uh
 
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
well I guess at first I want to give
 
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
everybody the ground rules for what
 
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing today just so everybody
 
00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 align:start position:0%
understands what we're what's happening
 
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right uh so it needs to say there is
 
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
to be no way we could go through all
 
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
these 27 bills in one day
 
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
um what we're what we're going to be
 
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
discussing here is that um for some of
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
you may or may not know but last session
 
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh this committee had
 
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
no floor debates except one brief
 
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
crypto I think we had a little
 
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
discussion on the floor but otherwise
 
00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
this committee is a 10-10 committee and
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
I have been working with the leader in
 
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
saying that what we want to do is that
 
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 align:start position:0%
we want to find legislation that we can
 
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
more than more than 10 10 can agree on
 
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
and that way we can go forward with and
 
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and so what we're going to be
 
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
discussing today is uh which bills have
 
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
that potential that we can go that we
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
can find some consensus that we can find
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
something that we can send to the floor
 
00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.930 align:start position:0%
something that we can send to the floor
sure

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I just want
 
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to make um a slight change
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
to the 1010 rule which is that
 
00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
um for an issue that we feel really
 
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 align:start position:0%
strongly about and that we feel that we
 
00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
want to be on the floor um we're going
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
to go forward we're not going to
 
00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
obviously do it if there's one person or
 
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
or two people but for something like
 
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.170 align:start position:0%
or two people but for something like
pfas

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
um we are going to go to P fast we've
 
00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
already agreed that we want to I'm just
 
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
saying I'm just saying there may or may
 
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
not be another issue where we want to do
 
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
that well I think I think we have a
 
00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
potential for a pfas solution okay okay
 
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
and that's we will take that up first uh
 
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
because I know that the uh Des has to
 
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
they have another meeting so right okay
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to Ambush you if that
 
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
turns out I I was going to qualify my
 
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
statement to be going forward here that
 
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
at this moment we have a couple of bills
 
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh the that that
 
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't you would think might be
 
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
a 10 10 but that
 
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
um uh I I have
 
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully proven myself that I am
 
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
determined to find a solution that we
 
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
can go forward and that is the the pfas
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 align:start position:0%
I I could really care less about what
 
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
happens with those special elections uh
 
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
all I care about is what happens in this
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
committee and also the reputation of
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
this committee that when we send bills
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
to the floor we are not going to wait to
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
decide who shows up that day that is
 
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
just not a good way to to run government
 
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you might think that's a
 
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
good thing I don't so at any rate so uh
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
having said that uh I just want to
 
00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 align:start position:0%
emphasize that people would say you know
 
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
like uh whether you want to come and
 
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
testify or whether you're going to you
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
know how much discussion we're going to
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
have and in any of these individual
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
bills it's really going to be is is
 
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.650 align:start position:0%
bills it's really going to be is is
um scheduling

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
um scheduling
 
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
going forward for the the next month uh
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
scheduling when we will discuss more uh
 
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
down and deep on any of that any
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
particular bill so we'll start out with
 
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
the pfas issue
 
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
um we have two pfas bills we have 242
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
and 465 and Mike
 
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
there you are all right
 
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
and uh and I have been talking with Mike
 
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.990 align:start position:0%
and and
um

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
didn't what's important is the es in
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
both of these bills Des is suppose is
 
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
the regulatory agency entity that'll
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
have to enforce these statutes
 
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.350 align:start position:0%
have to enforce these statutes
and

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I think is
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
important and I hope we do the Democrats
 
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
think is important is passing something
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
that is enforceable
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
and that we have a state entity that is
 
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
ready willing to enforce it
 
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so that's why I'm
 
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
interested in here what Mike has to say
 
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
so yes representative spear
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh one comment I would make
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure that whether or not it's
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
enforceable is the most important part
 
00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
I think part of it the most important
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
part is to get it to stop
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
and if we can join and have something on
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
the books that say New Hampshire is
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
against the flooding of pfas into the
 
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.110 align:start position:0%
against the flooding of pfas into the
state

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
eventually if enough States get to it
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
and right now there's 24 States looking
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
at it if we can join that has power so
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure that just having
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
something that's enforceable is the most
 
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
important criteria I think it's the
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
power behind a lot of states
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
telling the manufacturers enough is
 
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.790 align:start position:0%
telling the manufacturers enough is
enough

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay so um uh well I disagree and I I I
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
I find uh over my 30 years 30 plus years
 
00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:49.139 align:start position:0%
of doing this the most important of any
 
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
anything we pass
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
is enforceability because putting
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
something on the books that just simply
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
says you can't do it and have uh have it
 
00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
says you can't do it and have uh have it
unenforceable

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh is is just feel good legislation and
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
and I I'm and I I I feel good is when I
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
pass things that are enforceable so that
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually we actually can do something
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
you're on uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mike wimsat I service

I know you've got a tight schedule today
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how deep you'll go today
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
but if there are questions from
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
committee members regarding potential
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
health effects and concerns about you
 
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
know why we're concerned about pfas I

say that you know we the agency first
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
um more than nine years ago now that
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
time we thought we had a problem related
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
to just firefighting Foams and we
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
started paying attention to that we
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
really didn't know about these
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
contaminants prior to that didn't know
 
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
much about them but then two years later
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
we discovered the impacts of widespread
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
air emissions that have caused
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
widespread groundwater and drinking
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
water contamination in Southern New
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and since that time we have
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
been working feversely that's more than
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
seven years ago I'm trying to address
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
and understand this problem we now know
 
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:38.220 align:start position:0%
based on the work that we've done that
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
we have pfas is really throughout
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
Commerce and as a result it's in our
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
food it's in the products we buy and
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
it's in our bodies and so one of the
 
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
things we said early on became very
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
evident to us and I think I'm on record
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
in early probably 2016 17 at legislative
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
hearings saying that we're working hard
 
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
to deal with this and on the tail end
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with you know Water and
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
Wastewater drinking water trying to make
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
sure people aren't drinking contaminated
 
00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:08.459 align:start position:0%
water but at the end of the day we're
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
not going to solve this problem unless
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
we get it out of Commerce in a way that
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
obviously you're not necessarily going
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
to get it out of all Commerce but there
 
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
are certain areas of Commerce where it's
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
debatable whether it's really a
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
necessary ingredient in the
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing process and uh we're just
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to be fighting a losing
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
battle if we don't reduce the amount of
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
pfas in the products that we purchase
 
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
and use
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
so having said that I want to just say
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we obviously you all know
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
from speaking with the Department
 
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
representatives in the past that we're
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
never in a position to say exactly where
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to be on a bill to we know
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
what the bill says until we've had a
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
chance to vet it through our department
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
leadership and through the governor's
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
office but what I can tell you today is
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
that um as as representative spear
 
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
indicated there are a number of states
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
that have already passed on pfas related
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislation related to the presence of
 
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
pfas and various products there are many
 
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
more states that are looking closely at
 
00:11:05.329 --> 00:11:05.339 align:start position:0%
that and an organization that that the
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
state has long belonged to since its
 
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:09.260 align:start position:0%
Inception the Northeast Waste Management
 
00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
officials Association which is an
 
00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339 align:start position:0%
association of basically the the waste
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
executive waste directors from from the
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
northeast states the eight northeast
 
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
states has been working on pfas model
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
legislation and that went out for
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
comment last spring it was very Broad
 
00:11:27.769 --> 00:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
and sweeping and I think the comments
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
that the group got have shown that
 
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
probably need to narrow the focus of
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
that legislation for it to really be
 
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:35.579 align:start position:0%
workable and implementable in the early
 
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
going here so we are working on that as
 
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact I'm headed to a meeting
 
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
there tomorrow with my counterparts in
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
the other states and that's one going to
 
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
be one of the topics of discussion but
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
in essence what we think we're going to
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
have is probably by December a model
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
legislation that's been narrowed down in
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
terms of its focus and what products IT
 
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
addresses by by December and being able
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
to vote on that so that would be
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
basically numoa's the organization's
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation for an appropriate model
 
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
legislation throughout the Northeast or
 
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
even the country and so I think that
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
what what we really would like to see as
 
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
an agency we'd like to see this issue
 
00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:13.019 align:start position:0%
stay in play in the coming session of
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature so we can talk about it
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
so we can be informed by what numoa
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
develops and what the other states are
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
doing I think that I've spoken with the
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
chair about this a couple of times I
 
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
think that when it comes to something
 
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:27.980 align:start position:0%
that des and the agency can get behind
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
something that is as a reasonable Focus
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
that has implementability through the
 
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
through the participation in a
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse if you know if all these
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
States passed laws with these kinds of
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
bans and certification requirements and
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
they all have a slightly different law
 
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
and they all in as a manufacturer of
 
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
business Community member you have to go
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
out to each one of those States figure
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
out what they want you to do and do it
 
00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.019 align:start position:0%
that's just not workable we never try to
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
get behind legislation like that but if
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
we can have uniform relatively uniform
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
legislation that can be effectively
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
administered through a Clearinghouse and
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
we have history with this with our
 
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
Mercury band that goes way back decades
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was a leader on that and
 
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
we really helped to drive getting
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
Mercury out of products which was a very
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
important thing to accomplish we can do
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
the same thing I think with pfas through
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
a clearing house we had a Mercury
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse that really does most of
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
the heavy lifting for us so it's not a
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
big burden or an expense for the state
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
to administer that program we think we
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
could use that model to do the same
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
thing for pfas and we believe that the
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
Internet Interstate Chemicals
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse which is administered
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
through pneumoa and the toxics and
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
packaging Clearinghouse which is also
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
administered through pneumoa we already
 
00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459 align:start position:0%
have good examples of how those can work
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
for a modest membership fee states can
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
participate and basically have a lot of
 
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:49.100 align:start position:0%
that notification and record keeping
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
burden taken off of them while at the
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
same time taking the burden off the
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
business Community because then instead
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
of going to a bunch of states the
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
business Community if they're marketing
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
products in the Northeast for example
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
just go to that Clearinghouse make their
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
certifications make their reporting and
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
then it becomes available to all the
 
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
states it's really shown to be a very
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
cost effective and efficient model and
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
we believe that with a bill that would
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
allow us to do that would give us
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
authority to participate in a
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse and administer whatever
 
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
ban the legislature decides is
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate we think that's a great
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
model so we'd very much like to see a
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill in play for the coming session
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
okay so um uh I'll take a question in a
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
second but I just want to clear up
 
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.670 align:start position:0%
second but I just want to clear up
something

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so our situation is that we have to
 
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
have this uh uh we have to take action
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
by November 17th
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
which is prior to that December date
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
um will there be something that we can
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
use that we can pass we can get on
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
obviously once uh that 17th then January
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
the first week of January would be voted
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
on by the house floor and then it would
 
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate so that in anywhere
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
along that process it can be amended to
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
address whatever changes that it comes
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
out in the model legislation but can we
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
have something before then that we can
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
use to at least get it out of this
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
committee sure the agency would be more
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
than happy to provide whatever technical
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
assistance in drafting that that is
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
desired to try to get you something that
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
you could be comfortable with by that
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
time okay absolutely all right now
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you it may be a
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
modification a little bit of what you
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
just asked we have two bills in front of
 
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
us right now that specify the use of a
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse for two specific areas of
 
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
products uh food packaging and carpeting
 
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.629 align:start position:0%
products uh food packaging and carpeting
textiles

00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
textiles
 
00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
is your recommendation that we wait on
 
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
that until we can see how this
 
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse is going to work and how
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
what no I guess what I mean is what the
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
model legislation looks like
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
sure well I I will tell you I will I
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
will know more in a couple of days
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
because I'm meeting with my counterparts
 
00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
who've been working on this at the end
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
of this week and I think that even
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
though we may not the the board may not
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
have voted on it yet which really for
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
this committee probably doesn't hold
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really matter that much but
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
I think certainly if you're looking at
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
um doing something in October or
 
00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.090 align:start position:0%
um doing something in October or
November

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
um we would have probably some good
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
language that we could help you know to
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
but is it still I looked at your other
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
model legislation just a couple of weeks
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
ago at least what was online and you and
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
I spoke at that time or actually a month
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
ago and at that time uh it looked like
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
it was Banning pretty much all of pfest
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that we really want to
 
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
do that because there are places where
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's useful I'm not suggesting that at
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
all no you're absolutely right it is
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
much broader and that was the the
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
comments that the that the organization
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
got were really aligned with that
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
concern I think what we're going to have
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
um soon is a and I believe it may
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
already exist I just haven't seen it is
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
a a revision to that model legislative
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
station that will be quite a bit
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
narrower than that original piece and
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
that's something we could certainly
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
share and help would help to inform an
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
amendment to one of these bills thank
 
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
amendment to one of these bills thank
you

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
okay so how much time do you need uh so
 
00:17:09.409 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
given this is so important to this
 
00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:10.909 align:start position:0%
given this is so important to this
committee

00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
um our first uh available day would be
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
October 3rd
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
that's a little early okay it could be a
 
00:17:20.449 --> 00:17:20.459 align:start position:0%
little later than that that would be
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
great but obviously we'll do it we will
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
provide whatever systems
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
I mean working from Tuesday you got 3 10
 
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
or 17.
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
can we go with 17. we want to go with 17
 
00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:34.730 align:start position:0%
can we go with 17. we want to go with 17
okay

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:17:39.169 --> 00:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry did you say November 17th
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
October October 17th
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
that that well basically I had
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
originally planned to have everything
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
out of this committee by the by the end
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
of my end of that week but I did not
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
realize that we had all the way out to
 
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.350 align:start position:0%
realize that we had all the way out to
November

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
so now that I know that we have November
 
00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:00.419 align:start position:0%
I have no problems setting that 17.
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
that's a proposal date for for the
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to work on that coming up
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
with uh some resolution to this so what
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming is that
 
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.610 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming is that
um

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:12.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
you too will stay together glued
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
together like Elmer's I don't know if
 
00:18:20.409 --> 00:18:20.419 align:start position:0%
Elmer's just got P fast in it
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
yeah work this out and so that when we
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
get to the 17 that you can be just as
 
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
happy and and and I have to be frank
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
what appeals to me most about this is
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
that we're not just targeting two
 
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
that we're not just targeting two
products

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:41.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll solve this polymer you
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
know one polymer versus two or more
 
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
polymer issue I don't know if that you
 
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:51.500 align:start position:0%
guys have resolution on that yet but
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I want to know yet there's
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
been a question about you know what's an
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate definition and that is a
 
00:18:59.810 --> 00:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
little nettlesome it's important we will
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
have that worked out I don't have I
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
can't tell you exactly I can't recite
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
what I think the exact definition should
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
be for this but but we'll that's some
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's something we can sort out
 
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:10.740 align:start position:0%
certainly okay okay sounds good and
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're not understand we're not trying to
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
ban all pfas because there are places
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
like space stations and stuff where it's
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
perfect I just heard that honeywell's
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
new Freon has had it has a one polymer
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
pfas in it so John if there's if there's
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
something out there that that I'll be
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
clearly the marketplace is created as a
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
result I'm trying to get pfas out of it
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
and that this is where it is and and I
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
hope I hope it's this and again that's
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
the reason why I like this legislative
 
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse concept
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
and we all did and it's in both of the
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
this you can't be then
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
you could be here on the third you know
 
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
so so but in terms of your thoughts
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
please yeah please send it send a text
 
00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
to the you know send an email to the
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
committee appreciate that okay uh
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
everybody okay now P pass all right so
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
we got we got through two bills thank
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
you very much gentlemen thank you Mr
 
00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:37.370 align:start position:0%
you very much gentlemen thank you Mr
chairman

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.289 align:start position:0%
chairman
okay

00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:39.299 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
all right now we'll go back to the
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
beginning of the schedule all right
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
first up is
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 225 relative to
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the use of currency that
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
could be detrimental to privacy rights
 
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.830 align:start position:0%
could be detrimental to privacy rights
um

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
did anybody here want wait and I I'm I'm
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
okay with interim studying this issue
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
just simply so we can keep it alive that
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
we can always be aware of some some
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
crazy thing that occurs that we as a we
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
can then come next year we can urge to
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
have legislation pass if something
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
occurs so representative spear
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
besides recommending that we itl this
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
I've spent many too many hours over the
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
summer investigating what this bill is
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
and what the implications are and I've
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
talked about implications and I don't
 
00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
want to talk about that again
 
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
the bill exists in a set in a place in
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
the RSA that protects privacy for
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
transaction types in other words loans
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
and various different types of loans it
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't in any way try to Define what a
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
legal currency is which is what this
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
bill tries to do this bill is trying to
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
Define what legal tender is the United
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
States has a legal tender it is the
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
dollar it is the only legal tender and
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
coins being a subset of dollars
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
the other part to that is the bill
 
00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:09.059 align:start position:0%
mashes together loan transactions credit
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
card transactions and cryptocurrency
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
transactions cryptocurrency is a barter
 
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:18.980 align:start position:0%
it is not money it is not legal tender
 
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
loans are not currency they are loans
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
credit cards are high risk loans
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
other kinds of loans like mortgage loans
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
or low risk loans and they all have the
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
characteristics of some of the things
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
that this bill wants to ban
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
those characteristics are already there
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
you have very little privacy with a
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
credit card loan you have a lot of
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
privacy with a mortgage loan but not
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
when the Federal Reserve issues dollars
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
they are not private they are anonymous
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
big difference if you drop a dollar on
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
the floor anybody gets it it doesn't
 
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
when you when the the Federal Reserve
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
used to issue bonds to personal people
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
like me or anybody
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
in 1982 they were prohibited from doing
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
that a bill was passed the regulation
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
was passed saying that if you're going
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
to issue a bond to an individual then
 
00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:24.020 align:start position:0%
you also have to keep track of the taxes
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
on the interest
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve said
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
screw that
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
and said no we will no longer deal with
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
the public and they don't and they have
 
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.630 align:start position:0%
the public and they don't and they have
not

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
the Federal Reserve also our dollars are
 
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
the National currency and the only
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
legitimate currency of 12 countries and
 
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.270 align:start position:0%
legitimate currency of 12 countries and
six

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh what do you call it the territories
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
the United States doesn't really nearly
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
change the characteristics but the most
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
important thing about this and why it
 
00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:57.419 align:start position:0%
seems to be getting mixed up with
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
somebody's idea of what's going on in
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
China I can't even begin to understand
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
but the most critical part of this I
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
think I think you got your point across
 
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
one okay why don't we hear from the
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
sponsor and to have okay have
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
him convince us why
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
why we shouldn't we should uh keep this
 
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:18.260 align:start position:0%
bill alive at interim study rather than
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
killing it all together because of where
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
it is in the statute and what you
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
identifying in the statute
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair for the record
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
replica pull it right up uh you can see
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
me I'm a hugging mine okay uh for the
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
record rep Mike Belcher out of Wakefield
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you received I had
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
had a printout that I had copies made I
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if that was delivered down
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
yet yes thank you excellent
 
00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:47.510 align:start position:0%
yet yes thank you excellent
um

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
when this was first introduced this
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
could easily have been seen as as
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge or outside of this sort of
 
00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.890 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge or outside of this sort of
mainstream

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
mainstream
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
however I would note at this point if
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
you were to look at that paper at this
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
point many people
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
um including presidential candidates
 
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
have outright called for the Banning of
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
a central bank digital currency because
 
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
of the implications that it could have
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
on the freedoms of Americans
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
um so this is this is not a radical
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
issue it's it's now a very mainstream
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
issue in fact a bill was just introduced
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
in Congress that would have a similar
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
effect to this one although I I don't
 
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
have a lot of Hope for a passing in
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
Congress anytime soon
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
um to address some of the points that
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
were just made uh the the the point of
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
um is certainly not intended to Define
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
what a currency is that is that is way
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of what we're seeking
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
to do with this
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
um what we're looking to do is very
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
simply to protect the rights
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire residents
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
to use an official currency whatever
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
that official currency may be
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
without being without there being any
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
capacity for the federal government the
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
Federal Reserve or any third party
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
through which a quasi-official currency
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
may be issued to automatically or
 
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
remotely block a transaction
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
which is a feature of programmable
 
00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:23.059 align:start position:0%
digital currencies
 
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh to to avoid having such
 
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.230 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh to to avoid having such
currency

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
currency
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily inflated or expire
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
which is something we have seen
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
programmed in digital currencies Central
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
digital currencies in other places China
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
would be one of those places we also see
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
at this point the development of a
 
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
potential supranational digital currency
 
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
through the IMF
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh so that's another route that this
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
could eventually take
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
um so that that's where this is trying
 
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
to address it's not it's not a bill
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
about trying to address or Define
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
currency it's about trying to protect
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
the rights of your individual citizen to
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
go out and anonymously conduct their
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
business without the government knowing
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
everything about it and without the
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
government being able to block it
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.539 --> 00:27:19.370 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I know this may seem like a fringe
 
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.750 align:start position:0%
so I know this may seem like a fringe
issue

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
um one of the best tools to learn about
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
how this is advancing around the world
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
is the Atlantic Council
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
right so I'll just read a couple of the
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
bullet points here
 
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
130 countries representing these are key
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
findings from their study of this issue
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
130 countries representing 98 of global
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
GDP are exploring a central bank digital
 
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.049 align:start position:0%
GDP are exploring a central bank digital
currency

00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
currency
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
19 of the G20 countries are now in the
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
advanced stage of cbdc development
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
11 countries have fully launched the
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
digital currency China's pilot on and on
 
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
and it goes on but
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is this issue technology
 
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
advances very quickly and it takes us a
 
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
little while to catch up and this is one
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
of those moments where we're trying to
 
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:15.140 align:start position:0%
catch up to this uh because it is
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
happening around the world and
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
there are just there's discussions of it
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
happening maybe at some point here we
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly what it's going to
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
look like is the issue I I think one of
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
the problems that we have is the notion
 
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
that a digital currency is something
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
different than the dollar
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
80 percent of our currency exists as
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
notations in an electronic Ledger eighty
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
percent of all the currency including
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
the transactions hold on I'm not there
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
yet okay the estimate the estimate that
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
I read said that it is a billions of
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
dollars in Bank fees and Swift fees
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
to transfer money from the United States
 
00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
to France or anywhere else you want to
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
transfer it if you're using Swift if you
 
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't use Swift you got to use something
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
else Swift is not a bank and it's not a
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
transmission effort it is the
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
replacement for a check all it is it
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
says take money from this bank account
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
and put it in that bank account that is
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
all that it does and they charge money
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
the countries got together and said we
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
we're paying billions upon billions of
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
dollars for that why don't we use
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
another transmission method and
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
blockchain came along it has nothing to
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
do with generating a different currency
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
it says that we can cut out billions of
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in fees if all we do is just use
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
a blockchain and use the Ledger from a
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
blockchain that's all that they're
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
trying to do I get it I got it Indiana
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
good questions
 
00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:48.299 align:start position:0%
two questions representative um one
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
curious who put forth that bill who's
 
00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:51.539 align:start position:0%
sponsoring that bill that went to
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
Congress and the second part of my
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
question is how do you think your bill
 
00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:57.500 align:start position:0%
would impact
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
taxation of citizens the IRS doing their
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
job and organize crime or terrorism in
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
terms of um in terms of looking at it on
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
a monetary basis uh thank you for those
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
questions I I don't recall the name I
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the handout right in front of
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
me because I left the original with the
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
copy machine but on that handout
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
identifies the prime sponsor in Congress
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
of the anti-cbdc bill
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
um as far as addressing how my bill
 
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.430 align:start position:0%
um as far as addressing how my bill
would

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
I really I think the broad part of the
 
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
question is how would it affect the
 
00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.169 align:start position:0%
question is how would it affect the
states

00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
relationship to the federal government
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the federal
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
government's coinage powers and what
 
00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539 align:start position:0%
they currently do
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
and that's a very good question that
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
needs to be explored because right now
 
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
the way it works is at least the way
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to work if everything is
 
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
done correctly is the federal government
 
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
only gets access to private information
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
about sales and things of that nature
 
00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:58.700 align:start position:0%
that individual citizens are conducting
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
with a warrant
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
and such a central bank digital currency
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
would completely do away with the
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
necessity to have a warrant before
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
accessing that sort of information if
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's programmed in a certain way that
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
this bill is seeking to address so the
 
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
answer would be if the federal
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
government decides that it wants to
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
introduce essential Bank digital
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
currency whether it does it through the
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
government itself through the Federal
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
Reserve or through some other third
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
party that it's acting as a quasi-public
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
private actor
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
um it wouldn't ultimately make much
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
difference it would
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to obtain that
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
information without a warrant through
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
cbdc and we blocked the implement the
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
implementation of that currency within
 
00:31:45.769 --> 00:31:45.779 align:start position:0%
this state then they would not be able
 
00:31:47.529 --> 00:31:47.539 align:start position:0%
to have access to that information which
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
pointedly is precisely what this bill is
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish
 
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
okay so here's let's just show you guys
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
all know where I'm coming from on this
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
issue over the years we would have bills
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
that we uh there were resolutions
 
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
that would urge Congress to pass
 
00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.889 align:start position:0%
that would urge Congress to pass
something

00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay and as some of you might know I
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
vote I always vote against resolutions
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't think they're worth the
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
paper they're printed on okay because
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
they don't have any effect Congress is
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
going to do whatever it wants to do
 
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
whether things is right or wrong but the
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
reason the compelling reason why people
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
do it is that they want to send the
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
message they want where we are with
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
something where we're thinking okay and
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
the classic example was uh Crow
 
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
Dickinson uh was always upset that Maine
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
would send over uh uh Tax Collectors to
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
North Conway and see if anybody was
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
selling refrigerators into Maine okay
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
and he wanted to to borrow it he wanted
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
to ban it well we we weren't gonna you
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
know pass laws to do that but we always
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
kept his bill alive
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
and the live is it would send any
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
message that we are aware of this issue
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
we have a vehicle that is something were
 
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
we the state could try to do something
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
not in this case probably if the federal
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
government actually did pass it which I
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
guess people want the federal government
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
to pass something but in some cases if
 
00:33:15.889 --> 00:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
some you know something different but so
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
the reason why I recommend interim study
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay and I know this your first term so
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
just you know right an interim study the
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
advantage of an inner study you know or
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
disadvantage is one way to look at it is
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is debt
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay the real the bill really is itl but
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
the committee still has it
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
so we would get to vote on it one more
 
00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:40.909 align:start position:0%
so we would get to vote on it one more
time

00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
a year from now
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay and a year from now
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
we can either say recommend for future
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend for future
 
00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:52.610 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend for future
legislation

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:55.460 align:start position:0%
and Anita will back me up last year
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
every single bill that was interim
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
studied was itl
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
we said not recommended for information
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
but the key element was that we kept it
 
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
alive we always allowed the discussion
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
to occur anybody can come forward and
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
say oh by the way you know that issue
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
look what I just saw in the paper you
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
know look what I see what's going on in
 
00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
El Salvador who is the one who's got
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency as their currency okay
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying else I mean whoever
 
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
people want to make those reference
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
points okay so yes the bill as it's
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
written is clearly flawed because it's
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
making references that it shouldn't have
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
it could absolutely be in the wrong
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
section but at the same time interim
 
00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:41.099 align:start position:0%
study is we're not closing the door that
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
we will be willing to take more
 
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.510 align:start position:0%
we will be willing to take more
information

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
along an issue now I would just remind
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
you they're going to be some other bills
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
farther down
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
you know over in that health insurance
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
categories okay that it's gonna I'm
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
gonna recommend the same thing and
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay the question I have is
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
this as the bill is written the only
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
people that get punished
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
for the feds doing whatever currency
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
thing this thing seems to think might
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
happen our New Hampshire residents and
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
as long as the bill says that that we
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
alone are going to get punished that we
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
are forbidden to use that currency
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
I I can't see keeping this alive you're
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
I understand you're making a case of why
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
this bill is is highly flawed and it's
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
the way it's written
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
the end of the case is is what was as I
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
always say every bill has a grained of
 
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.150 align:start position:0%
always say every bill has a grained of
Truth

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
Truth
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
every bill has a grand truth and all I'm
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
saying is is it really worth it you know
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
to you know intermediate because again
 
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
this is a 10 10 otherwise it's a 10 10
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
issue again I don't know it is I think
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's you think that's people that
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
actually want to punish New Hampshire
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
residents I for some crazy currency
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
thing that they absolutely think that
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
this Republicans uh are are are are are
 
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:02.579 align:start position:0%
very much concerned
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
as reading the reading these findings
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
are very much concerned about what is
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
going on out there therefore they would
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
want us to pass something now I know
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
this is not what we would pass
 
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.270 align:start position:0%
this is not what we would pass
okay

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have this conversation go
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
for it we're gonna have this
 
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
conversation multiple times
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
what I'm just saying is we're not voting
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
today okay we're not voting today
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're not at this point this is a
 
00:36:30.589 --> 00:36:30.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommend you know looking
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
at subcommittee recommendation okay so
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh and this is the business subcommittee
 
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
so I don't know who's here from the
 
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.370 align:start position:0%
so I don't know who's here from the
business

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:39.380 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we got one two three four
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
five who else is on the business up
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
getting six okay that sure looks like a
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.329 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
how many more things do you have on here
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
that you're worried that you're that
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
you're all lined up again oh my God no I
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
promise though these are the only two I
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
care about I'll be quiet about
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
everything else okay I promise okay okay
 
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:15.260 align:start position:0%

exactly 2024 you can do you know
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
whoever's in this chair can do what they
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
think is the radius thing okay uh HB 227
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
relative Fair access to financial
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
services so this is another similar
 
00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.050 align:start position:0%
services so this is another similar
issue

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm just recommending thank you very
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
much I'm recommending to interim study
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill is not ready for
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
prime time but we want to send the
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
message that we definitely don't want to
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
hear that you know abuse by Financial
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
incentives and using uh this is this is
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right but also now this is
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
the red line
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative we we also did pass one
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
of your bills last year
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
that's another kid but I'm saying we the
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
right and this is just trying to go
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so you turn the mic on okay so or
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
would you be okay with us uh interim
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
studying this bill and just keeping this
 
00:39:29.569 --> 00:39:29.579 align:start position:0%
issue alive so we can talk about it and
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
specially pay attention to if we find
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
out that some financial institution
 
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
really was
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
selling it sold to to ESG
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
I I certainly would be uh
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
agreeable to that I what was submitted
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
however was
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
last uh spring when you reviewed
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
reviewed the bill there were some
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
various issues that were raised by uh
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
opponents of the bill and an amendment
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
was crafted and you never got a chance
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
to look at it right so what you have
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
should have in front of you is that
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment from OLX that's excellent
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's great that I really appreciate
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
having this now okay thank you very much
 
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
okay all right does the subcommittee
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
need to well I I would prefer to have
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
some discussion on this before we Italy
 
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:23.339 align:start position:0%
no we're not in ital we're interim study
 
00:40:26.089 --> 00:40:26.099 align:start position:0%
even before we do that okay know more
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
about the bill
 
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.290 align:start position:0%
about the bill
well

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:29.300 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
if knowing about it means if you heard
 
00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:35.339 align:start position:0%
my Spiel at the beginning here that if
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend time learning
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
delving deep into a bill then I'm going
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
to schedule it for another day
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
well let's just have a preliminary
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
discussion about it
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear what the gentleman has
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
turn your mic on make sure thank you uh
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
what the amendment did uh and you should
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
have the amendment from OLS and then and
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
then another copy which gives you the
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
amended language in Red so it's easy to
 
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.450 align:start position:0%
amended language in Red so it's easy to
see

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
one of the uh or two of the various uh
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
opponents of the bill were concerned
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
that uh the
 
00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
um the bill would cause them to have to
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
change the scope of their actions an
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
agricultural bill or agricultural bank
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
and a Trust Bank we're concerned that
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
the bill would make them have to open up
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
their Bank to
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
every member of the public so that was
 
00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:41.660 align:start position:0%
addressed in section A 1A
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
saying that that's not the case
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association were concerned
 
00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.210 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association were concerned
that

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:50.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
um those that were feeling aggrieved by
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
working with the bank would become
 
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
hostile and volatile and and the bankers
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
could not use uh could not
 
00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:05.170 align:start position:0%
could not use uh could not
um

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:05.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
stop the process from going forward
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
because of the way the bill was written
 
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
and and section B amends that language
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
to basically say that if you have a
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
client that's becoming hostile and
 
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
volatile that is reason for the bank not
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
dealing with them a legitimate reason so
 
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
it takes that issue off the table
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and one of the last things was the
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
penalty section was inappropriately
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
cited the wrong RSA was given so that
 
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
was fixed
 
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
so those those fundamental issues were
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
changed the key premise of the bill
 
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
however remains that there is is a is
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
potential a problem here there's this is
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
a forward-looking bill looking at what
 
00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:53.339 align:start position:0%
people are in the banking industry are
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
saying they are going to do and when I
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
say people in the banking industry the
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
top six banks in the United States say
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
they are going to implement these kinds
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
of tactics the chairman of Bank of
 
00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
America and I'm going to give you the
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
one takeaway quote here
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
take our 200 000 people our three
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
trillion dollar balance sheet are 60
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
billion of expenses you start aiming
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
that gun and you take across all these
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
companies it's huge
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
so if they're going to implement these
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of tactics
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
you have the senior major banks in the
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
United States agreeing that implementing
 
00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
these kinds of tactics is something they
 
00:43:44.329 --> 00:43:44.339 align:start position:0%
are looking to do they haven't done it
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
yet if you look at their program first
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
they look at their Bank themselves
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
how are we going to operate within ESG
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
criteria next they look at all their
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
suppliers and the third step which we're
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
not at yet is they look at their clients
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
this bill is forward-looking to say
 
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
you're not going to look at your clients
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to stop it
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
got it thank you very much
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
do we really want to keep going no no
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
this is a this is such a slight
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
difference this I just I'd like to ask
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
the chair going forward that we not
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
start the conversation by asking the
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
person testifying wouldn't you agree
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%

first okay if you want me not to try to
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
move things along that's fine I can I
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
would not categorize it as moving things
 
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:36.770 align:start position:0%
would not categorize it as moving things
okay

many times we did pass it at one point
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
in time with the uh uh the six months uh
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%

is there anybody feel that want to
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
discuss it rather than it yelling it
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're seeing none all those in favor
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%

all right
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
um relative to the condominium
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
um I have this also is itl
 
00:48:12.849 --> 00:48:12.859 align:start position:0%
uh anybody
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to go to carpet on that it
 
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:22.460 align:start position:0%
all in this one
 
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
okay question I have a question yes is
 
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
the are these two bills uh 178 and
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh 239 are they uh together no they're
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
yeah the the 178 is about putting it
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
have letting tenants to throw uh uh uh
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
put liens on on their neighbors uh I
 
00:48:53.089 --> 00:48:53.099 align:start position:0%
think was what that was the Killer
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
Killer part of that one and uh 239 is uh
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
just the financial trying to get
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
financial informations out of out of
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
these uh boards and and I think there
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
was even a bond issue in there or
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
something but I don't know it was it was
 
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
it was pretty much unenforceable and it
 
00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:17.579 align:start position:0%
was problematic for condos okay so itl
 
00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:19.099 align:start position:0%
with that one
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh that was representative alamy's bill
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%

um I I have recommend an inexperience to
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
legislate we already we had passed
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
something last session I thought we had
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know we had resolved the issues but
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
um that they're just this putt it just
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
continues to get stirred yes I I would
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
recommend the interim interim study on
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
this as well I think we we've had these
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
people before us uh over a couple of
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
times I think the the bill on the other
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
side I think they that was almost
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
unanimously passed and I think we should
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
take up a study of this I I really think
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
we owe it to these people
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not opposed to that that's fine
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
because it's really killing a bill when
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
you interim study ability bill but it
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
means you're we are concerned about an
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
issue that we would like to keep it
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
around to discuss it
 
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay everybody in favor of interim study
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure I got the right list can
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
you read that list again
 
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh yes for business banking yes the
 
00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
spear okay so we got Aaron Cole action
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
oh yeah and you're missing a Democrat so
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
you're replacing that Democrat did you
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
approve that chair
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
you're both okay so stop voting
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
you're not on it
 
00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.870 align:start position:0%
you're not on it
yeah

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay so this
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
this list is wrong then no no that's
 
00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:14.329 align:start position:0%
this list is wrong then no no that's
right

00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
I had I thought I printed the official
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
list and send it out on this let's take
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
a photo this email but on this didn't I
 
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
was in her page two in this email that I
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
I just didn't print
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
so um it was on 115 for the 115 but it
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
the list of people who are on the
 
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.450 align:start position:0%
the list of people who are on the
insurance

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:40.460 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
oh I see the list yeah the list at the
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
bottom here I'm not unassure
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know according to it so that's
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
who I have for your banking
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
that's from the very beginning yeah this
 
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.030 align:start position:0%
that's from the very beginning yeah this
is

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
yeah no this is Insurance that's
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
insurance so where's the afternoon oh
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
that one didn't happen didn't have it
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not going to worry about it too
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
much because if the motion is interim
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
study all those in favor raise your hand
 
00:52:10.319 --> 00:52:12.730 align:start position:0%
study all those in favor raise your hand
and

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:12.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:22.940 align:start position:0%
all right on to my next category
 
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh 73 right to uh repair of Home
 
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.549 align:start position:0%
uh 73 right to uh repair of Home
Appliances

00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
Appliances
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
so this bill started out to be it was
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
all about big appliances and now all of
 
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:35.579 align:start position:0%
a sudden you know they come in with
 
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
little appliances that frankly are I
 
00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
don't even think you need the manual for
 
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
because you're just going to throw it
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
out and get another one but
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
I do have a I have a very expensive gas
 
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
stove and I probably wouldn't throw out
 
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
but I don't know how how complicated it
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
is to repair it but
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
so okay I I I was not uh too excited
 
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
about passing it says him when he want
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
to Pat Uh keep this bill around in room
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
study it or talk about it some more or
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
do we
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
you have something you want to say Keith
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
yeah just quickly um so I think this is
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
going to be one of those perennial
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
issues until it gets resolved so
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
I guess interim study if we want to
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
follow the same philosophy of keeping an
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
issue alive uh just because we know it's
 
00:53:26.049 --> 00:53:26.059 align:start position:0%
going to come back again okay
 
00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay interim study all those in favor of
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
interim study please raise your hand
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay all the pose
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
good enough okay
 
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:44.099 align:start position:0%
all right next up
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
is prohibiting the state from
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
Contracting the Chinese government or
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
Affiliated technology manufacturers
 
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay so I was going to interim study
 
00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
this because people were worried about
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
it but I don't know
 
00:53:59.770 --> 00:53:59.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I was worried that uh the the
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
governor did say that that the
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
um the state
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
was prohibiting so I wasn't really sure
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
what the governor's order begins or ends
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
or this goes a little farther than the
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay question yes didn't think I read
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's order at one point and it
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
seemed to say that
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
the state for state-owned computers
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
correct they would not buy from the
 
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:35.990 align:start position:0%
correct they would not buy from the
Chinese

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
Chinese
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of fact the federal
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
government doesn't allow any of the
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
federal agencies to buy from the Chinese
 
00:54:47.089 --> 00:54:47.099 align:start position:0%
but private people I don't know that
 
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
anything says that you can't do that
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
well I hope not because everybody's
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
that let alone be confusing which China
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what this bill does so
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear on what this bill does
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay so you want to kill it or enter
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
Jesus we already got it yeah I was going
 
00:55:15.049 --> 00:55:15.059 align:start position:0%
to understudy it just just just just to
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
send the message that we we care but we
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
don't want to clutter up our statutes
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
with China so all those in favor of
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
we got
 
00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:32.630 align:start position:0%
we got
one

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.809 align:start position:0%
one
okay

00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:39.020 align:start position:0%
to hold up somebody okay let's go
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
but you don't know what you're holding
 
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:59.290 --> 00:55:59.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
yeah uh House Bill 173 related to toilet
 
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
facilities provided by restaurants uh I
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
think we wanted to repeal the statue
 
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.589 align:start position:0%
think we wanted to repeal the statue
right

00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
okay so so we we need to drop an
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
amendment to repeal it and can you I
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
know that you had some other yeah why
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
don't you come on up introduce yourself
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we're going to ask you to do a
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
good morning Phil Sherman chair of the
 
00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:32.339 align:start position:0%
building code review board uh the
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that I found on the website
 
00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.809 align:start position:0%
amendment that I found on the website
already

00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
deletes one of the Clauses okay we speak
 
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:40.460 align:start position:0%
in favor of that
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
as I testified I think to the
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
subcommittee getting rid of the whole
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
thing would be even better but I'm not
 
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
going to fall in my sword on that one I
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
do think that the separate fixture issue
 
00:56:55.569 --> 00:56:55.579 align:start position:0%
I'll refer to it as all gender
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
that train has left the station so the
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
plumbing and the building codes already
 
00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:04.430 align:start position:0%
plumbing and the building codes already
address

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I'll call it the current thinking on
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
that the upcoming building code will
 
00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
permit uh what I'll refer to as the
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
European style of one big room with a
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
bunch of stalls and sinks in the middle
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
or whatever to be used by everybody the
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
current codes sometimes it's referred to
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
as a Dunkin Donuts Amendment basically
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
if you have two unisex rooms they must
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
be posted for use by everybody you can't
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
can't assign them so this conflicts with
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
the code I think it's a might out of
 
00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.410 align:start position:0%
the code I think it's a might out of
date

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:35.420 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:39.780 align:start position:0%
RSA 155 seems to be the closet of of
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
Public Safety stuff and once in a while
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
probably not the best
 
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.589 align:start position:0%
probably not the best
simile

00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
simile
 
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
okay so but if if you had your drugs we
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
should just uh repeal the whole
 
00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.849 align:start position:0%
should just uh repeal the whole
paragraph

00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
because you know I love repeal I love
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
that word the rest of this section uh
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
gives the
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
DHHS the right to
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
provide relief but they've still got to
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
get really from the building code
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
so it's it's really dealt with through
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
the codes at this point the only thing
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
this does do is it brings in alcoholic
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
beverage service the building code
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
separates between restaurants and what
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
they call taverns or bars so clearly
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's restaurants with alcohol without
 
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
alcohol not clear that that really ought
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
to lead us to a different approach to
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
but we wouldn't have any problem with
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
deleting the whole section
 
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
okay he's talking about so this would be
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
155 colon 4 Roman numeral one
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
I believe it's colon 40 isn't it excuse
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
me I said 40 40. Roman number one that's
 
00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
correct just repeal that
 
00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:58.910 align:start position:0%
correct just repeal that
okay

00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
who wants to do that Amendment anybody
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
okay you want to take care of that you
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
get that Amendment drawn up okay great
 
00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:08.579 align:start position:0%
so you just just go to legislative
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
Services the old men it'll be Amendment
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
and it'll be just to remove
 
00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
it would actually would be uh it would
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
it would change the whole bill it would
 
00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:21.260 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
amend the entire bill after the entitle
 
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
so he doesn't he's telling you right I'm
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
telling you right now what it's going to
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
be so I'm yeah so so I'll talk we'll
 
00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:36.059 align:start position:0%
talk afterwards so but every what it'll
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
be is it'll say
 
00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.589 align:start position:0%
be is it'll say
um

00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
I meant replace everything after the
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
enacting clause
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
and then it's going to say repeal RSA
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
155 colon 40 Roman numeral one
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
and then it'll have
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
the and the effective date will stay the
 
00:59:57.059 --> 00:59:59.390 align:start position:0%
the and the effective date will stay the
same

00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
very simple just love that piece of cake
 
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
one year I passed I peeled with one bill
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
I had two whole rsas repealed we are
 
01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:09.140 align:start position:0%
saving the state of New Hampshire
 
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
that's the Pinnacle of my repeal
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
statutes okay all right thank you very
 
01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.069 align:start position:0%
statutes okay all right thank you very
much

01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
so that would be odd to pass as amended
 
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
all those in the subcommittee agreed to
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
that please raise your hand
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
this is the business everything's
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
business to this morning you're not on
 
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.210 align:start position:0%
business to this morning you're not on
business

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.089 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm sorry all right good
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
you're on all right you're on today no
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
matter what okay all those in favor of
 
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
repealing of of uh the lot to pass as
 
01:00:49.970 --> 01:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
amended please raise your hand okay one
 
01:00:55.930 --> 01:00:55.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
all those who opposed to not to pass
 
01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:01.140 align:start position:0%
this amendment saying none okay
 
01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.730 align:start position:0%
this amendment saying none okay
unanimously

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.089 --> 01:01:13.099 align:start position:0%
all right uh okay now we're to
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 201 relative to resale of
 
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
event tickets
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
so as we all know this is not a problem
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
just to eventic it's it's uh hotels
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
another other what other
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
vacation rentals I think that you can
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
take you can sometimes choose the wrong
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
booking company 201
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
yes in line with your idea that if the
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill is not enforceable we probably
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.329 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes any discussion on the motion
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative not enforceable is
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
that the concern it's not important it's
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
totally unenforceable okay
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
I mean yeah you're yeah you're gonna go
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
chase the internet you know companies
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
that that are based out of China or
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
whoever they are I'm trying to remember
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion this is this is the one
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
where I know I remember the bill I'm
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
talking about the enforcement discussion
 
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
wasn't it was going to be under the AG's
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
office or something uh it was a
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
violation of the consumer protection act
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
and under the consumer protection act uh
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
and you know it's the Attorney General's
 
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
or the consumer protection division
 
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
and I believe he's he was here but I
 
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't see him today
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
and he the enforcement was is you know
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
he everybody's aware of this problem and
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
like I say it happens more with hotels
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
I mean the you know bookings
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
my wife did it uh this this past year
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
and then she she started telling the
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
story and the person
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
and never said oh by the way that you
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
know you're you're not talking to the
 
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
hotel you're talking to this a booking
 
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.130 align:start position:0%
hotel you're talking to this a booking
company

01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:03.140 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and then of course because we
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
were intimately found out what happened
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
by the time when we checked in and then
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
the instructions were lost
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
didn't get through so
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
but the ticket this this ticket scalping
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
you know it's a detectively it's not
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
scalping but how it was outrageous to
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
hear that
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
um they they promised something and they
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
they might not even have that ticket and
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
then they go then they call up and and
 
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
buy the ticket through the actual
 
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
through Ticketmaster and then turn
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
around and sell it to you for a fee
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
and they and they in in your purchasing
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
with them you pre you agree to a
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
purchasing fee Without Really realizing
 
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
that's that's what you did wasn't part
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
of it like a disclosure to like you have
 
01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
to disclose that you're not buying it
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't that the point of this build
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
mainly was like if you're on
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
Ticketmaster you say hey this is not
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
being bought directly from whatever
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
browse theater or something like that
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
right exactly
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
I mean that and then there's the other
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
part which is you have to own it
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
outright to be able to sell it but you
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
could you actually had to have it in
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
possession right right so how do you
 
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
enforce that that's the part that's hard
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
to what were the other parts the other
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
part enforceable because then you can
 
01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
just make sure that it's disclosed
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:19.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
director of The Palace Theater
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
um has
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
um indicated on the website that if you
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't buy that you should buy the ticket
 
01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
at The Palace Theater website so they
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
can do that so the companies can you
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
know assure individuals that if they buy
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
that ticket with them where the events
 
01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
no I understand I was just saying like I
 
01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.150 align:start position:0%
no I understand I was just saying like I
think

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
and it might be hard to enforce because
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're a small state but like yeah this
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
would require like StubHub to to have a
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
thing saying you're not buying it from
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
the past how do we how do we mandate
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
that yeah how do we bend it you can
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.049 align:start position:0%
that yeah how do we bend it you can
notify

01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059 align:start position:0%
notify
 
01:04:54.059 --> 01:04:55.130 align:start position:0%
notify
right

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
so by the end I I mean I mean it's this
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
is one of those classic cases I wish we
 
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
could help inform
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
the general public and you know in the
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
old days if Google it used to admit that
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
you got to look for the line but now the
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
line is so thin you can barely see it
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's like it's a dotted line and that so
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
when you look at a listing above the
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
above front is the advertisers
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
and then just under you'll see just a
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
little little dots and under that is
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
actually the actual entity that you were
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
seeking you would even if you typed in
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
Palace Theater however I have now found
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
for myself personally that and and it's
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
and it's in and I'm so far I'm betting a
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
hundred percent that when you type in
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
Palace Theater
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
over in the right
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
is the map
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
is the mapping is Google Maps and if you
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
click on the Google Maps it will then
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
pull up and say would you like the web
 
01:05:58.370 --> 01:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
page and that has worked for me a
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
so if I could if I could tell anybody in
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
the room if you're Googling if you want
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're getting the actual
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
people you're trying to deal with
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually go look at the Google Map and
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
click on the icon in the Google Map now
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
having said that it's amazing how many
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
times I've done that and I look on it
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
and it says do you own this site that
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
means the actual owners the actual
 
01:06:28.970 --> 01:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
business doesn't even realize it's there
 
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
and that happened to me years ago
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
several years ago and immediately
 
01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
because someone someone had put on my
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
property and wrote it not what I I call
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
it Sunrise Castle they put it up as hunt
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
castle and I immediately said oh yeah I
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
own that
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
oh you know and and uh and then took it
 
01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
over and made sure that nobody else
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
could then post you know
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
post up to it but so all right but
 
01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable you take a picture
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
you take a picture and if and and make a
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
comment this is a great you know runner
 
01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
runner ever Google will then ask you and
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
I say you know can we identify can we
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
identify that location people do this
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
that's right right but yeah that you can
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
you're online so yeah it's ironically
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
then you can then identify a location
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
and best of all they even give you a a
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
web listing you can get a web listing
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
for free
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
whoever heard Google gave anything away
 
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
for free but yes there's a nice view I
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that I saw in
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
heard during that discussion and one of
 
01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
the worst things was there's this big
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
company in the UK
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
that routinely
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
um commandeers websites for these kinds
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
of things and I tried to book a
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
a thing over in uh what is it in Nashua
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
at the at the art center and that site
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
did did that and charged like three
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
times the amount of what the ticket was
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
when I was trying to go to the Nashua
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
Arts Center your site
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
and I there's no way to to legislate
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
against something happening in the UK
 
01:08:20.289 --> 01:08:20.299 align:start position:0%
and we were told that they were
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
constantly under lawsuits and they don't
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
care they're just a factor of business
 
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor of interim study
 
01:08:31.849 --> 01:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
right is that where we're at interim
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
study or itl
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
itl okay all those in favor of itl raise
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
uh itl
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
all right we're almost there
 
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
but believe it or not okay uh all right
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis for retail sales
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
um uh the the commission is meeting
 
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
they're moving right along
 
01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.709 align:start position:0%
they're moving right along
um

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
I'm on the commission
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
and uh it's uh it's a very Lively
 
01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
discussion because uh they're all the
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%
all the potential opposition is also on
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
the commission so we have the chief of
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
police and we have uh but the ACLU is
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
right and actually represent field is on
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
it and represented Sullivan's on it so
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
Commerce is well represented on this
 
01:09:28.679 --> 01:09:31.030 align:start position:0%
Commerce is well represented on this
Commission

01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.570 align:start position:0%
Commission
so

01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
um and I'm fully confident that that we
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
will come up with legislation in the end
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
but we'll keep this one alive just to
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
have it around
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor of interim study
 
01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:49.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
all right all right it could be liquor

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan okay
 
01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
um all those in favor of interim study
 
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
um the legalizing cannabis for retail
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
sales five five forty four okay
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
and all those opposed
 
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay five to one
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
five to one
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
interim study okay
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
and last but not least Senate Bill 180
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
relative to product labeling and
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
prohibition of the sale of hemp products
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
containing THC
 
01:11:21.659 --> 01:11:22.510 align:start position:0%
containing THC
so

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.030 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.729 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:11:27.729 --> 01:11:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
Delta Delta nine yes
 
01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a serious
 
01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
ly yeah right so what addressed some of
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
them this one got overcome didn't it by
 
01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:39.980 align:start position:0%
611. so what happened what what happened
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
in the end that the the bill that passed
 
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
the study committee the commission
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
included this uh ban a Delta 9 but
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
it has a caveat that it's sun sets
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
so uh and and I'll take responsibility
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
for that because I wanted to put the
 
01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
pressure on getting the commission bill
 
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.649 align:start position:0%
pressure on getting the commission bill
passed

01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
so one of the ideas of having that we
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
will deal with the Delta 9 Delta a Delta
 
01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:15.140 align:start position:0%
9 issue in
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
in that legislation so that's why Sunset
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
it so for all intents and purposes you
 
01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
know we can just uh interim study this
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
just to keep it alive well so what
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
happens if the bill doesn't if we don't
 
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
get something passed or signed this year
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
so if something didn't happen when we
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
meet a year from now
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
when does it sunset the sunset is is uh
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 2024.
 
01:12:43.679 --> 01:12:45.830 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 2024.
so

01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
isn't this 2023 yeah July 1 2024 so six
 
01:12:49.679 --> 01:12:50.630 align:start position:0%
isn't this 2023 yeah July 1 2024 so six
months

01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
well it'd be six months not six months
 
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
it was six months the effective date was
 
01:12:58.330 --> 01:12:58.340 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the year so the the um
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
that so a year from now let's say if it
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
didn't happen
 
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
you know if it didn't get passed then we
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
we can then recommend for future
 
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:09.370 align:start position:0%
we can then recommend for future
legislation

01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:09.380 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
if we still want to be in it but I'm not
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
sure the committee was fully I think we
 
01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
were all concerned that there was no age
 
01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
requirement if I recall the conversation
 
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.590 align:start position:0%
requirement if I recall the conversation
requirements

01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
and the the labeling and I would say
 
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
that it you know the commission where we
 
01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
talked about packaging
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
the problem with the Delta Packaging is
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
it it is appealing to kids right
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
and and that's clearly a problem yeah I
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
mean but if we're gonna I guess I'd just
 
01:13:40.370 --> 01:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
be concerned that if we're going to
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
struggle to get cannabis legalized which
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
we've been struggling with various
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
different models we wouldn't want to
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
like throw the baby out with a bath
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
water not have something like this go
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
through which would actually make a real
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
difference for potentially a young child
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
buying these things that are completely
 
01:13:57.169 --> 01:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
unregulated and it sounds like when
 
01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who actually gets like
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
poisoning from THC it's generally this
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
synthetic THC not the stuff you get from
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana so but I think
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
I think we shouldn't I don't know I
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't know the best way to deal with it
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we want to work on it
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
because when we talked about it before I
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
raised a question about I'm not really
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
supportive of initially Banning it but
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
like putting an age restriction on it
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
right now there is none I almost wonder
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
if we just tweaked it to add data
 
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
description versus not right band and
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
then passed it so that's true we could
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
fix it by age restriction and packaging
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
requirements I wonder if that might be a
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
useful thing problem with that is the
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
packaging requirements then is going to
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
who what state entity is then going to
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
be regulating the packaging and and so
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
therefore the packet because you had the
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
packaging means you they have to submit
 
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
it to a a state entity which in this
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
case when we're done with the commission
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
will be the Liquor Commission right okay
 
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
the liquid commission will have a set up
 
01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
a division within the marijuana board
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
that would be approving packaging that
 
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
that is not child child interesting
 
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
so we are now gonna if we were to try to
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
pass that now
 
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
it's before that entity has even been
 
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
created so it's somewhat problematic to
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
try to do that now
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
could you still do the age requirements
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
requirement revisit the packaging I mean
 
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
at least at least then I doubt that
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people buying it around
 
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
your age but I'm sure there are some and
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
so this would at least maybe eliminate
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
right so yeah can you pull up the bill
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
um so we could just
 
01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
um so we could just
um

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
remember that also the bill needed
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it was about the 0.03 or
 
01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:44.900 align:start position:0%
something of THC it was ahead had
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
just say what it is okay that's right
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
all right so retail approaches
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
Association yeah so it had the 0.03
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
rather than certain points yeah there
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:38.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:38.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:43.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
which is fine the eight that's right
 
01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
because it was that's right Simon was
 
01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:50.060 align:start position:0%
involved in the assignment he was yeah
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
he was he was ensuring that he was
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
ensuring that only he could sell it
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
right rather than than the store is
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
selling it which would take care of the
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
21 year old problem because he had to be
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
21 to get into an ATC
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's why he doesn't say anything about
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh when we last left
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
that bill we corrected the value of uh
 
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.590 align:start position:0%
that bill we corrected the value of uh
hemp

01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
hemp
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
but we did not correct the direction
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
in other words it's the way it was last
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
left it's legislating against hemp over
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
Point greater than 0.03 and hemp is not
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
greater than 0.03 it's less than it
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
should be less than greater than is pot
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
and cannabis
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
right so you got to change
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
to less than not greater than because
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
then you're stepping on marijuana
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.199 --> 01:18:02.209 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
just hit her up say it I mean you want
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
to work on this element you want to you
 
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
want to take charge of this it sounds
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
and we did this amendment and it sounds
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
like we just we just changed to less
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
than so what is the complicate what's
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
what why are we so right now right now
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have anything to do about the
 
01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:18.500 align:start position:0%
21. right okay because the 21
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
is is because it says it can only be
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
sold through
 
01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
the it's medical marijuana people
 
01:18:27.179 --> 01:18:29.470 align:start position:0%
the it's medical marijuana people
um

01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:36.659 align:start position:0%
we're looking at Senate Bill 180 as
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:45.239 --> 01:18:52.910 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:55.209 --> 01:18:55.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
was that going to get repealed in six
 
01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:08.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
yesterday

01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
right okay no that's fine that's right
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
because I I knew that we addressed it in
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
611. yeah I think
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
so right now so right now it it did was
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:38.890 align:start position:0%
 
.

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
age there's no age requirement and no
 
01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
and no atcs they just just took that
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
just lifted just that paragraph and did
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
the less less than it's him yeah so okay
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's happy if there's too much
 
01:19:59.090 --> 01:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
THC in them then you know it's you get
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
nucleus problems okay so that's why
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
greater than is correct and
 
01:20:02.159 --> 01:20:07.910 align:start position:0%
greater than is correct and
representative

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's talking about the level of THC in
 
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
hemp right so right it's defined as less
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
than 0.03 that's the definition of hemp
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
well so the prohibition is against
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
anything greater than 0.3 that's what
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
the prohibition is you can't sell any
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
hemp that has THC that's greater
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
but that's not hemp I'm sorry that's not
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
him if it's greater than 0.03 it's not
 
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
him it's synthetic right so well the key
 
01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
elements is somebody might call it him
 
01:20:38.699 --> 01:20:39.530 align:start position:0%
elements is somebody might call it him
yeah

01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:41.580 align:start position:0%
if you're saying that or someone might
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
call it him but it's and in your mind
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's not hemp it's marijuana and this
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
statute says you're that that is correct
 
01:20:51.770 --> 01:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
if you're calling it you know THC and if
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
it's greater than 0.3 then it ain't hemp
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
right it's illegal
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay so that's in effect until until the
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.310 align:start position:0%
end of the
right

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
so all right so theoretically
 
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
theoretically if we interim study it
 
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.229 align:start position:0%
theoretically if we interim study it
then

01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
like we get here a year from now and
 
01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
let's say nothing passed through the
 
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.209 align:start position:0%
let's say nothing passed through the
marijuana

01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:17.219 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
that would have expired so yes we would
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
then probably would want that
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
legislation we would actually do move a
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
year from now as recommend for future
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
legislation so I would say we should
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to make my notes here
 
01:21:39.239 --> 01:21:41.390 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to make my notes here
okay

01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
all right all those on the Merrell
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
liquor committee
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
all those on the liquor committee agree
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
agree with interim study please raise
 
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
your hand one two three four five
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
I'm still lost on the 0.03 versus 0.3
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
yes the 0.03 is wrong it is now it's 0.3
 
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
yes the 0.03 is wrong it is now it's 0.3
okay

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
all right so you're okay with that now
 
01:22:11.219 --> 01:22:12.250 align:start position:0%
all right so you're okay with that now
okay

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:12.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
unbelievable huh
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay so what I have for my notes just to
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
summarize is
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
um on the 17th of October we will be uh
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
focusing in on House Bill 645 the
 
01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:37.340 align:start position:0%
decentralized autonomous organizations
 
01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:40.820 align:start position:0%
and uh the pfas
 
01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:44.470 align:start position:0%
and legislation
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:45.770 align:start position:0%
and legislation
[Music]

01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
and that's actually two of them but I
 
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
think one of them will end up
 
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
interim studying it once we're once we
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
find one that we can agree on with a new
 
01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
find one that we can agree on with a new
solution

01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.689 align:start position:0%
solution
okay

01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much and we'll do
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
this again
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
just insurance
 
01:23:11.159 --> 01:23:12.770 align:start position:0%
just insurance
yes

01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
and I broke it up into I broke it up
 
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
into insurance and then Property and
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah no it's all pretty much health
 
01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.219 align:start position:0%
insurance I don't think we had too many
 
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:15.410 --> 03:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
we'll get started here
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
um the room looks a little lighter than
 
03:16:21.590 --> 03:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
03:16:23.389 --> 03:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
but I guess that's because this issue is
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
a little more narrow
 
03:16:26.990 --> 03:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:16:28.730 --> 03:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
um so somewhat picking up where we left
 
03:16:31.250 --> 03:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
off House Bill 414 related to health
 
03:16:34.670 --> 03:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for preventative pfas
 
03:16:34.680 --> 03:16:36.349 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for preventative pfas
carrier

03:16:36.349 --> 03:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
carrier
 
03:16:39.710 --> 03:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
anybody wanna
 
03:16:46.190 --> 03:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.200 --> 03:16:50.809 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:16:50.809 --> 03:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:50.819 --> 03:16:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.880 --> 03:17:00.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:04.010 --> 03:17:04.020 align:start position:0%

um I was gonna ask for itl because of
 
03:19:35.929 --> 03:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
the um commission ongoing but I was
 
03:19:38.090 --> 03:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
asked by representative Stringham if we
 
03:19:38.100 --> 03:19:38.809 align:start position:0%
asked by representative Stringham if we
could

03:19:38.809 --> 03:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
um if we could do interim study because
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
he thought there might be one or two
 
03:19:43.370 --> 03:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
elements in the bill that would
 
03:19:44.990 --> 03:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
complement what the commissioner is
 
03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:46.010 align:start position:0%
complement what the commissioner is
doing

03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%

03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:19:49.020 --> 03:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
with that
okay

03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%

I'm interested how that's going Mr
 
03:20:15.359 --> 03:20:21.889 align:start position:0%
I'm interested how that's going Mr
commissioner

03:20:21.889 --> 03:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:23.210 --> 03:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
this is official
 
03:20:25.610 --> 03:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
to get sworn in this morning too they're
 
03:20:28.969 --> 03:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:31.730 --> 03:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
I would only just comment that uh I have
 
03:20:33.710 --> 03:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
great respect and admiration for New
 
03:20:35.809 --> 03:20:35.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's unique form of democracy but
 
03:20:37.730 --> 03:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
that Council process certainly has its
 
03:20:40.010 --> 03:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
harrowing moments it does it's a it's a
 
03:20:41.750 --> 03:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
roller coaster ride in it it certainly
 
03:20:44.389 --> 03:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
is it certainly is so the update is that
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
in about two weeks time three weeks time
 
03:20:47.809 --> 03:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
we will have a comprehensive
 
03:20:50.330 --> 03:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
presentation ready for you
 
03:20:53.809 --> 03:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
to give you a sneak peek of what you
 
03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
might expect I've kind of envisioned
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
that this will
 
03:21:00.290 --> 03:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
have three parts to to it uh the
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
presentation will the first part will
 
03:21:07.370 --> 03:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
lay out the numbers as it pertains to a
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
very narrowly tailored definition of
 
03:21:11.630 --> 03:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
prompt pay
 
03:21:13.790 --> 03:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
and what you're going to find is based
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
off of the MCAS data
 
03:21:17.809 --> 03:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
that if you're just looking at again
 
03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
that narrow definition of 30 days
 
03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the New Hampshire
 
03:21:25.429 --> 03:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
carriers are almost 97 percent in
 
03:21:29.330 --> 03:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
compliance which is right in line with
 
03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
the national average we're actually
 
03:21:32.030 --> 03:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
slightly better than the national
 
03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:32.990 align:start position:0%
slightly better than the national
average

03:21:32.990 --> 03:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
average
 
03:21:34.730 --> 03:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we obviously know
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
that there are some issues that we've
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
got to deal with
 
03:21:39.889 --> 03:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
and so what it demonstrates to us is
 
03:21:41.510 --> 03:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
that if you're looking at the issue
 
03:21:43.969 --> 03:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
purely within prompt pay 30 days you're
 
03:21:46.730 --> 03:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
not getting at the heart of what has
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
been at issue with carriers and the
 
03:21:52.250 --> 03:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
hospitals and so there has to be
 
03:21:55.250 --> 03:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
something more to the problem and so we
 
03:21:57.889 --> 03:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
intend to identify some of those issues
 
03:22:00.349 --> 03:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
share with you what they are
 
03:22:02.950 --> 03:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then perhaps provide some
 
03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:05.939 align:start position:0%
recommendations for you all to consider
 
03:22:08.690 --> 03:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
certainly our team to think about and
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
consider I know that all of you want to
 
03:22:13.730 --> 03:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
resolve these issues we want to resolve
 
03:22:15.650 --> 03:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
these issues I've made a commitment to
 
03:22:17.210 --> 03:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
the executive Council to do everything
 
03:22:19.730 --> 03:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
that I can to help bring this to
 
03:22:21.290 --> 03:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
resolution and that's what we will do
 
03:22:23.929 --> 03:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
and then we will take a look at the
 
03:22:25.730 --> 03:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
report that the New Hampshire Hospital
 
03:22:28.130 --> 03:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
Association put forward and again we'll
 
03:22:30.769 --> 03:22:30.779 align:start position:0%
do a deep dive analysis of that and I
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
think that all three of those pieces
 
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
will complement each other very very
 
03:22:37.130 --> 03:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
well and will give you a clear and
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive picture as to what's
 
03:22:41.809 --> 03:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
what's really going on
 
03:22:43.730 --> 03:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
so that's my update as it pertains to
 
03:22:45.769 --> 03:22:45.779 align:start position:0%
that legislation and when did you expect
 
03:22:48.170 --> 03:22:48.180 align:start position:0%
this to two three weeks that would mean
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
you tell us if you want to come back and
 
03:22:51.530 --> 03:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
you know whatever works for your
 
03:22:53.030 --> 03:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
schedule like I said I think we'll be
 
03:22:54.410 --> 03:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
ready to roll in about two weeks time
 
03:23:00.530 --> 03:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:00.540 --> 03:23:15.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:23:15.170 --> 03:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:20.330 --> 03:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
all right any questions for any comments
 
03:23:25.729 --> 03:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:25.739 --> 03:23:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%

03:23:56.090 --> 03:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
number of meetings
 
03:23:59.450 --> 03:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
um with really interested parties this
 
03:24:01.250 --> 03:24:01.260 align:start position:0%

03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:08.090 align:start position:0%
um and we've identified
um

03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
a number of billing codes that are
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
relevant to this issue and
 
03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
um we have another meeting set up to try
 
03:24:19.269 --> 03:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
to get final confirmation
 
03:24:23.469 --> 03:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
that those billing codes are
 
03:24:26.410 --> 03:24:26.420 align:start position:0%
the ones that are you know not being
 
03:24:29.450 --> 03:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
successfully build
 
03:24:32.929 --> 03:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
um and once we do that we'll be able
 
03:24:34.790 --> 03:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
we'll be in a position to basically
 
03:24:38.510 --> 03:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:24:42.050 --> 03:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
so while you're there I know there's
 
03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
um how's your the study committee on
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
coverage for Reproductive Health Care
 
03:24:52.610 --> 03:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
you guys were doing a study committee on
 
03:24:55.429 --> 03:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
that was our 198 which we had ours was
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.570 --> 03:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
you want to give us an update on that
 
03:25:01.790 --> 03:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
while you're there
 
03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
so the report it has been concluded it's
 
03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
been done we used our contractor to do
 
03:25:08.929 --> 03:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
it I believe it's been distributed to
 
03:25:11.090 --> 03:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders
 
03:25:13.309 --> 03:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
this point
 
03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
we'll make be sure to get a copy to you
 
03:25:17.510 --> 03:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
as well well I don't have that one I'm
 
03:25:19.309 --> 03:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
not a mistakeholder but hey I don't
 
03:25:21.229 --> 03:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
think I ever seen it yet so we will get
 
03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
that to you ASAP it was just concluded I
 
03:25:26.090 --> 03:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
think late last week okay uh it was just
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
concluded late last week can you give us
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
I was in Scotland
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
the number is big
 
03:25:39.769 --> 03:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
that's what I can tell you the number is
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
big it is Big it's big yeah well some
 
03:25:45.769 --> 03:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
some of us had predicted when that got
 
03:25:48.170 --> 03:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
passed that it would be big yes
 
03:25:50.090 --> 03:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative spear
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's not exactly a question but it is a
 
03:25:54.889 --> 03:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
a comment based on some research I did
 
03:25:57.170 --> 03:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
over the summer on this bill it's we're
 
03:25:58.610 --> 03:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
talking about the reproductive Health
 
03:25:59.929 --> 03:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
Care One
 
03:25:59.939 --> 03:26:01.610 align:start position:0%
Care One
okay

03:26:01.610 --> 03:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
no state in this country has such a bill
 
03:26:07.490 --> 03:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
has such a law that is true
 
03:26:11.330 --> 03:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
five countries in the world have the law
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
and the only that's with some extent and
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
those countries have all got
 
03:26:19.210 --> 03:26:19.220 align:start position:0%
um Universal Health Care kind of things
 
03:26:23.269 --> 03:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:23.279 --> 03:26:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:26:28.250 --> 03:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we should even
 
03:26:30.769 --> 03:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
consider it based on that kind of a
 
03:26:33.170 --> 03:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
thing no I I will get to that but I just
 
03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
want to hear how the department so the
 
03:26:38.090 --> 03:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
only other question did it have because
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
you also have the you know because you
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
have all the secret formula stuff here
 
03:26:44.090 --> 03:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
so one of the numbers we've always been
 
03:26:46.070 --> 03:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
this committee's always been intrigued
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
by is what percentage of quote unquote
 
03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
mandates have on our overall premium and
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
I know that that does create a judgment
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
call of what the premiums and then we've
 
03:27:01.490 --> 03:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
we've heard you know anywhere from three
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
to three to eight or something on there
 
03:27:05.929 --> 03:27:05.939 align:start position:0%
we've heard numbers
 
03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
um do we have an idea what percentage
 
03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
this had impact it had on
 
03:27:14.570 --> 03:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much of the impact this
 
03:27:16.370 --> 03:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
specific would have right I mean I think
 
03:27:18.530 --> 03:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
as you appreciate chairman hunt
 
03:27:20.929 --> 03:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
rarely is it the case now this is an
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
exception to that but rarely is it the
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
case that any single mandate is going to
 
03:27:26.929 --> 03:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
significantly put upward pressure on
 
03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
premium the problem is of course the
 
03:27:31.490 --> 03:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
cumulative effect of all of them and
 
03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
what does that introduce into the
 
03:27:34.969 --> 03:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
dynamic such that it could put upward
 
03:27:36.889 --> 03:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
pressure on premiums
 
03:27:40.190 --> 03:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding from my team as it
 
03:27:42.830 --> 03:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
pertains to this piece of legislation is
 
03:27:45.229 --> 03:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
that they faced a really difficult
 
03:27:47.450 --> 03:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
barrier in terms of how the legislation
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
was drafted
 
03:27:50.870 --> 03:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
and so what I would I say this all the
 
03:27:52.729 --> 03:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
time but is a general rule but in this
 
03:27:52.739 --> 03:27:53.710 align:start position:0%
time but is a general rule but in this
case

03:27:53.710 --> 03:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
case
 
03:27:56.809 --> 03:27:56.819 align:start position:0%
we're happy to be a resource to anyone
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
who would like us to review
 
03:28:00.830 --> 03:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to ensure that it is
 
03:28:03.410 --> 03:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
achieving the objective that you as
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
policy makers are hoping to to achieve
 
03:28:09.830 --> 03:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's difficult when folks get
 
03:28:11.929 --> 03:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
results back from us
 
03:28:14.570 --> 03:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
um they're not happy with the results
 
03:28:18.050 --> 03:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
that came back out we can only assess
 
03:28:20.450 --> 03:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
the legislation based off of what's
 
03:28:22.610 --> 03:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
there on the paper in terms of what
 
03:28:24.670 --> 03:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
would become statute if it were to
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
become law
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh and so there were there were some
 
03:28:30.769 --> 03:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
drafting issues Freeman I think did the
 
03:28:32.090 --> 03:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
best they could
 
03:28:34.729 --> 03:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
to assess it based off of how it was
 
03:28:37.910 --> 03:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
drafted and so I will be sure to get the
 
03:28:39.950 --> 03:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
the study to you before the end of the
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
day okay
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
sure you're telling me I have to have
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
another mandate to do a baseline to
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
compare this one we have some
 
03:28:49.370 --> 03:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
information that we can we can make
 
03:28:50.929 --> 03:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
available to you know on the on the
 
03:28:53.150 --> 03:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
global question that'd be great
 
03:28:55.250 --> 03:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
um if I might Mr chairman I'd update the
 
03:28:56.750 --> 03:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee on one other item as it
 
03:28:59.030 --> 03:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
pertains to a ground ambulance which I
 
03:29:01.250 --> 03:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
know is a topic okay yeah yeah that's
 
03:29:02.929 --> 03:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
true yeah that'd be good so as
 
03:29:04.610 --> 03:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs knows and I
 
03:29:06.170 --> 03:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
believe I made you aware of this too
 
03:29:08.090 --> 03:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
representative hunt the New Hampshire
 
03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
insurance department is trying to take a
 
03:29:14.030 --> 03:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
proactive approach to resolving a
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
developing situation it's been
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
developing for some time but it's really
 
03:29:20.570 --> 03:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
I think coming to a bit of a crisis
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
Point as it pertains to ground ambulance
 
03:29:26.450 --> 03:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
providers particularly the private
 
03:29:29.630 --> 03:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance providers at the end of
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
the day the municipals are under the
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
same pressure but they have safety nets
 
03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
underneath them the safety nets being
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
other areas of their communities fire
 
03:29:41.450 --> 03:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
department budget or ultimately all of
 
03:29:44.450 --> 03:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
us as property taxpayers to our
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
communities but the privates of course
 
03:29:50.690 --> 03:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
do not have that safety net and so I
 
03:29:52.670 --> 03:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
have convened what I've called an
 
03:29:54.170 --> 03:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
ambulance Summit for lack of a better
 
03:29:56.330 --> 03:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
term but I've brought together some
 
03:29:59.030 --> 03:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from the ambulance provider
 
03:30:01.969 --> 03:30:01.979 align:start position:0%
Community uh led by uh state senator
 
03:30:04.070 --> 03:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
Susan Prentice she's kind of identified
 
03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
some of the key players there at the
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
table all of the commercial carriers are
 
03:30:12.170 --> 03:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
at the table we have had some very
 
03:30:14.570 --> 03:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
positive discussions so far
 
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have had the group break into I think
 
03:30:20.330 --> 03:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
three or four subgroups that are looking
 
03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
at different aspects of this uh and and
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to hopefully make
 
03:30:29.210 --> 03:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
some progress I'm not entirely sure that
 
03:30:31.670 --> 03:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
we'll need any sort of legislation to
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
address this which is good news
 
03:30:36.650 --> 03:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
obviously but it is possible
 
03:30:39.170 --> 03:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
and I want to stress possible
 
03:30:43.190 --> 03:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
though I am an optimist that there may
 
03:30:45.650 --> 03:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
be an agreement around
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
some form of limited prohibition on
 
03:30:50.570 --> 03:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
balance billing as it pertains to ground
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
ambulance that both sides through that
 
03:30:55.969 --> 03:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
give and take process may be able to
 
03:30:57.469 --> 03:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
reach an agreement
 
03:31:00.710 --> 03:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
and so that be the case
 
03:31:02.570 --> 03:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
um where representative Burroughs bill
 
03:31:05.210 --> 03:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
is in interim study I assume that it is
 
03:31:07.250 --> 03:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
still viable to potentially become a
 
03:31:10.130 --> 03:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
vehicle toward an agreement uh before
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
you've got to get things out uh I think
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
your deadline is the beginning of
 
03:31:16.130 --> 03:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
November yeah well at the end of the day
 
03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
we could have it till the first week of
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
January okay because the first week of
 
03:31:22.130 --> 03:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
January we could then come in with a
 
03:31:23.990 --> 03:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
different motion if that was an
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
amendment great well as I said I am an
 
03:31:28.010 --> 03:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
optimist but I'm not making any promises
 
03:31:30.969 --> 03:31:30.979 align:start position:0%
as most of you know this has been a many
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
decades-long issue but I think that
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
given the Confluence of events facing
 
03:31:38.570 --> 03:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
the situation here in New Hampshire with
 
03:31:41.870 --> 03:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
ambulances it may be the opportune
 
03:31:44.450 --> 03:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
moment for some sort of a grand a
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
compromise in a package of things that
 
03:31:49.490 --> 03:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
will hopefully resolve the issue
 
03:31:53.990 --> 03:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:57.650 --> 03:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
okay now to the last one uh excuse me Mr
 
03:32:00.830 --> 03:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
chairman yep so are we deferring to 35
 
03:32:04.790 --> 03:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
and 198 to a later date two yes uh yeah
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
235 uh which we just discussed yes we
 
03:32:09.650 --> 03:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
will we will uh I guess we'll take him
 
03:32:14.590 --> 03:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
foreign so we have three bills date
 
03:32:19.849 --> 03:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
specific now for the 17th okay now four
 
03:32:22.490 --> 03:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
now we have yet no not this afternoon
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
the 17th two from this morning you are
 
03:32:26.929 --> 03:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
here well I mean this subcommittee yeah
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:30.000 --> 03:32:31.130 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:32:31.130 --> 03:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:32:34.250 --> 03:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
all right uh HP 130 repealing the drug
 
03:32:40.450 --> 03:32:40.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move itl because apparently
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
um there's been progress made
 
03:32:48.590 --> 03:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
um in the budget and and other ways of
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
dealing with it there was
 
03:32:52.190 --> 03:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
that is true okay
 
03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
any discussion on inexpensive legislate
 
03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
in HP 130
 
03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
see none all those in favor say aye aye
 
03:33:04.849 --> 03:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
aye those opposed
 
03:33:07.130 --> 03:33:07.140 align:start position:0%
Moody Ansley
 
03:33:07.140 --> 03:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
Moody Ansley
okay

03:33:09.830 --> 03:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.840 --> 03:33:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:33:12.229 --> 03:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:15.290 --> 03:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
I think it's the same situation for 172.
 
03:33:15.300 --> 03:33:17.450 align:start position:0%
I think it's the same situation for 172.
so

03:33:17.450 --> 03:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:17.460 --> 03:33:19.190 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:22.130 --> 03:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
right right so we can ID all that one
 
03:33:22.140 --> 03:33:28.670 align:start position:0%
right right so we can ID all that one
also

03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.309 --> 03:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor of inexpensive
 
03:33:35.450 --> 03:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
legislate say aye aye those opposed
 
03:33:38.929 --> 03:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.769 --> 03:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
so representative Calabro wants to give
 
03:33:48.889 --> 03:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
um how how many different mandates are
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
in or entities change the words for that
 
03:33:56.090 --> 03:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to have the sponsor of the
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
bill give us a reworded version of this
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
as we had discussed at our last
 
03:34:02.450 --> 03:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
committee meeting okay but can you give
 
03:34:04.990 --> 03:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
me a thumbnail of how many
 
03:34:07.250 --> 03:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
of the you have
 
03:34:11.090 --> 03:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
303 somehow it seemed like you threw the
 
03:34:13.130 --> 03:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
kitchen sink at it he really did which
 
03:34:15.769 --> 03:34:15.779 align:start position:0%
is why we need more time so I know but I
 
03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
just want to know
 
03:34:21.170 --> 03:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
so for the rest of the committee members
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.150 --> 03:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
can't even remember
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh we had a bill to mandate a natural
 
03:34:32.269 --> 03:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
pass to be
 
03:34:35.050 --> 03:34:35.060 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians
 
03:34:38.809 --> 03:34:38.819 align:start position:0%
and uh and natural paths are what could
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
be close to into the same categories as
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
these people and
 
03:34:48.590 --> 03:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
um the end result was that uh the this
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee said okay
 
03:34:54.290 --> 03:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
we'll instead of having shall
 
03:34:57.769 --> 03:34:57.779 align:start position:0%
we turn it into a May
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
which means that doesn't mandate the
 
03:35:02.330 --> 03:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to do it
 
03:35:06.530 --> 03:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
it just means that they're that they're
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
there there is a parameters that they
 
03:35:10.250 --> 03:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
could do it and what the parameters
 
03:35:12.830 --> 03:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
would be if they did want to do it
 
03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:14.210 align:start position:0%
would be if they did want to do it
and

03:35:14.210 --> 03:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:16.729 --> 03:35:16.739 align:start position:0%
um I have not heard too much pushback on
 
03:35:19.010 --> 03:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
the natural pass May haven't heard much
 
03:35:21.469 --> 03:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
any complain about it so I would speak a
 
03:35:22.849 --> 03:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
little bit about what I know the
 
03:35:22.859 --> 03:35:24.349 align:start position:0%
little bit about what I know the
sponsors

03:35:24.349 --> 03:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
03:35:26.809 --> 03:35:26.819 align:start position:0%
um were willing to concede about
 
03:35:28.309 --> 03:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
um and what I've discussed with some
 
03:35:30.889 --> 03:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
members here in Commerce that um
 
03:35:34.090 --> 03:35:34.100 align:start position:0%
had originally wanted it to be tabled
 
03:35:37.130 --> 03:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
the um are retained
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
essentially we have
 
03:35:39.960 --> 03:35:40.729 align:start position:0%
essentially we have
um

03:35:40.729 --> 03:35:40.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:43.490 --> 03:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
a system where a primary care provider
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
like myself has a patient in chronic
 
03:35:48.170 --> 03:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
pain they generally on average have
 
03:35:49.969 --> 03:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
about 10 years of chronic pain before
 
03:35:52.729 --> 03:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
they make any progress in getting the
 
03:35:55.190 --> 03:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
treatment and getting efficacy
 
03:35:56.929 --> 03:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
in the short period of time that I've
 
03:35:59.450 --> 03:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
been a part of hb66 committee which
 
03:36:02.530 --> 03:36:02.540 align:start position:0%
studies The Chronic the treatment for
 
03:36:04.370 --> 03:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
non-pharmaceutical treatment of chronic
 
03:36:04.380 --> 03:36:05.210 align:start position:0%
non-pharmaceutical treatment of chronic
pain

03:36:05.210 --> 03:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
pain
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's become very clear that most of the
 
03:36:12.410 --> 03:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
models that we see I'm not as fond of
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping we can find a better model
 
03:36:16.610 --> 03:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
but essentially what I know Nagel and
 
03:36:18.229 --> 03:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
Merchant were willing to concede was
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
they agreed that it needs to be licensed
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
by the state a
 
03:36:25.910 --> 03:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
B we need to make sure that it has a
 
03:36:28.790 --> 03:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
limit we need to cap what is acceptable
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
and 12 seem to be the magic number that
 
03:36:33.050 --> 03:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
insurance companies were happy with
 
03:36:36.830 --> 03:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
and the third part
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
was what I told him was that a mandate
 
03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
isn't going to get past anybody and I
 
03:36:43.610 --> 03:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to mandate anything
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's enough of evidence for the research
 
03:36:47.330 --> 03:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
that we've done thus far that is showing
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
that this is a more economical solution
 
03:36:53.809 --> 03:36:53.819 align:start position:0%
and if it's six weeks of efficacy and
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
less than one and a half epidural
 
03:36:56.809 --> 03:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
injections I think we should be
 
03:36:58.729 --> 03:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
evaluating it which we're doing in this
 
03:36:58.739 --> 03:36:59.870 align:start position:0%
evaluating it which we're doing in this
committee

03:36:59.870 --> 03:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
not this committee but that committee
 
03:37:05.210 --> 03:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
I want to at least get the ball rolling
 
03:37:07.190 --> 03:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
so that providers like myself have a
 
03:37:08.210 --> 03:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
little more options than just
 
03:37:15.429 --> 03:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.530 --> 03:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.540 --> 03:37:25.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:25.090 --> 03:37:25.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
oh I like that's good good okay I want
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
this done safely and not with just
 
03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
somebody who says I'm a health care
 
03:37:34.250 --> 03:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
provider okay sorry licensing is
 
03:37:34.260 --> 03:37:35.150 align:start position:0%
provider okay sorry licensing is
important

03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:37:35.160 --> 03:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
important
great

03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:37.920 --> 03:37:42.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:42.239 --> 03:37:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:43.370 --> 03:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:37:45.410 --> 03:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
so um I urge you guys to get that
 
03:37:47.090 --> 03:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment drawn up right away and get it
 
03:37:48.410 --> 03:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
out to the Committee Member so we can
 
03:37:49.969 --> 03:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
see it ahead of time
 
03:37:51.769 --> 03:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
and so at least we can get it and if
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's any questions we could smooth it
 
03:37:56.330 --> 03:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
so by the time we get to the to the 17th
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
we can have it resolved
 
03:37:59.279 --> 03:38:13.969 align:start position:0%
we can have it resolved
okay

03:38:13.969 --> 03:38:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:13.979 --> 03:38:17.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:38:17.269 --> 03:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.279 --> 03:38:18.889 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:38:18.889 --> 03:38:18.899 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
everybody ready to move on from that one
 
03:38:24.590 --> 03:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
okay 383 relative provider contract
 
03:38:30.889 --> 03:38:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
if everybody understand now what a PBM
 
03:38:35.450 --> 03:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
is that it's just an offshoot of the
 
03:38:37.370 --> 03:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
insurance company and
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
the idea of Licensing and regulating
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:47.570 --> 03:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
so I looked this one up
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
and six states have exactly the same
 
03:38:52.680 --> 03:38:53.809 align:start position:0%
and six states have exactly the same
words

03:38:53.809 --> 03:38:53.819 align:start position:0%
words
 
03:38:56.450 --> 03:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
that this bill has
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
and on the surface it seems like a good
 
03:38:58.439 --> 03:38:59.510 align:start position:0%
and on the surface it seems like a good
idea

03:38:59.510 --> 03:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
idea
 
03:39:02.570 --> 03:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
accept that and every other state that
 
03:39:05.150 --> 03:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
has this there's a lot of other laws
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
around it that say things like mac
 
03:39:11.570 --> 03:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
prices have to be published
 
03:39:14.570 --> 03:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
the sources for the drugs have to be
 
03:39:18.170 --> 03:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
available and noticed
 
03:39:21.410 --> 03:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
they don't have it with this bill the
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
wording of this bill by itself it needs
 
03:39:25.849 --> 03:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
to have the other stuff that goes around
 
03:39:25.859 --> 03:39:27.950 align:start position:0%
to have the other stuff that goes around
it

03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:39:31.490 --> 03:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to do that
 
03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
then this bill kind of leaves us with a
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
situation where the drug companies or
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
the I'm not I don't mean the drug
 
03:39:41.210 --> 03:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
companies the pbms can say well then in
 
03:39:42.830 --> 03:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
that case we're just going to raise the
 
03:39:45.349 --> 03:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
price to whatever you can get it for
 
03:39:45.359 --> 03:39:47.570 align:start position:0%
price to whatever you can get it for
so

03:39:47.570 --> 03:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:49.610 --> 03:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should leave the bill
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
is not viable by itself to do us any
 
03:39:54.290 --> 03:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
good at all so I'm kind of thinking
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
maybe we better not do it
 
03:40:00.650 --> 03:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.450 --> 03:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh would you repeat that question what
 
03:40:06.530 --> 03:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
other states you said had oh Ohio uh had
 
03:40:09.950 --> 03:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
this laundry list of uh I have a list I
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
do want me to get I'm interested in any
 
03:40:15.050 --> 03:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:15.060 --> 03:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
remember

03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
remember
 
03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:23.090 --> 03:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
and I write everything down so I've got
 
03:40:23.100 --> 03:40:25.250 align:start position:0%
and I write everything down so I've got
it

03:40:25.250 --> 03:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
curious as to why you're you're asking
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
I I know we do tend to think of
 
03:40:37.490 --> 03:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
ourselves as being the most highly
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
regarded region in the country but I
 
03:40:40.969 --> 03:40:40.979 align:start position:0%
wondered what under it was on the line
 
03:40:44.389 --> 03:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
here but uh because the same carriers
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.330 --> 03:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
not everyone might have known that New
 
03:40:56.330 --> 03:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
York California Kentucky Ohio Hawaii and
 
03:40:58.429 --> 03:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
Illinois and then I went fell asleep and
 
03:41:01.729 --> 03:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
but I thought that was a nice
 
03:41:06.530 --> 03:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
cross-section of states that did it
 
03:41:09.530 --> 03:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
all right you're all right itl yeah
 
03:41:11.570 --> 03:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with itl yeah
 
03:41:11.580 --> 03:41:12.769 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with itl yeah
okay

03:41:12.769 --> 03:41:12.779 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:41:14.389 --> 03:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
all those in favor Innings being
 
03:41:18.190 --> 03:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:27.290 --> 03:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll make my daughter's soccer
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
game after all okay granddaughters all
 
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
right relative to affordability and
 
03:41:41.349 --> 03:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
Bill and uh we had a little conversation
 
03:41:44.640 --> 03:41:46.429 align:start position:0%
Bill and uh we had a little conversation
and

03:41:46.429 --> 03:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
um at this point
 
03:41:48.060 --> 03:41:49.610 align:start position:0%
um at this point
um

03:41:49.610 --> 03:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:52.670 --> 03:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
the issue is great that to really get us
 
03:41:55.610 --> 03:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
all informed to knowing about what this
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
is what's going on out there
 
03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
um but at this point uh my radical idea
 
03:42:03.650 --> 03:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
was maybe a little too radical and
 
03:42:06.650 --> 03:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
people weren't exactly ready for it and
 
03:42:08.150 --> 03:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think I would like to interim
 
03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
study this just so we keep the that
 
03:42:17.389 --> 03:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
relationship uh balanced in terms of how
 
03:42:20.330 --> 03:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh what the hospitals are charging
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
um for these uh these
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
rare and unique books what was your
 
03:42:30.769 --> 03:42:30.779 align:start position:0%
um that that they had basically had to
 
03:42:32.450 --> 03:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
use pbms
 
03:42:34.849 --> 03:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
use the PBF pricing rather than their
 
03:42:36.889 --> 03:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
in-house pricing the proprietary nature
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
of that seems to be the big sticking
 
03:42:38.520 --> 03:42:40.729 align:start position:0%
of that seems to be the big sticking
point

03:42:40.729 --> 03:42:40.739 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:42:40.739 --> 03:42:41.750 align:start position:0%
point
so

03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
is everybody okay with interim study
 
03:42:47.809 --> 03:42:47.819 align:start position:0%
about 513 for 5 13. yeah
 
03:42:50.750 --> 03:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor say aye those
 
03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:51.950 align:start position:0%
okay all those in favor say aye those
opposed

03:42:51.950 --> 03:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
so moved unanimously
 
03:42:57.469 --> 03:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh last but not least uh directing the
 
03:42:58.849 --> 03:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
insurance department to conduct a
 
03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
custody of providing coverage for
 
03:43:04.870 --> 03:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:11.570 --> 03:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:16.150 --> 03:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:17.929 --> 03:43:17.939 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
03:43:17.939 --> 03:43:20.570 align:start position:0%
yeah right
um

03:43:20.570 --> 03:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:22.729 --> 03:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
03:43:25.550 --> 03:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
I thought there was two different ones I
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
thought the the issue
 
03:43:32.809 --> 03:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
the issue I forgot that it was it was
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
the cost study involved in it
 
03:43:35.819 --> 03:43:37.550 align:start position:0%
the cost study involved in it
uh

03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:39.889 --> 03:43:39.899 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
03:43:39.899 --> 03:43:42.950 align:start position:0%
right okay
but

03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.469 --> 03:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
at this point we're we're we we put it
 
03:43:48.290 --> 03:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
off to the 17th to actually get
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
the study so that but it would be a
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
little premature for us to kill this
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
building until we until he actually seen
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
the study but but yes representative two
 
03:44:00.720 --> 03:44:01.670 align:start position:0%
the study but but yes representative two
points

03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:44:04.190 --> 03:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
no insurance company is prohibited from
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
doing it for instance if you want to
 
03:44:09.530 --> 03:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
work for uh what is it the coffee
 
03:44:09.540 --> 03:44:10.610 align:start position:0%
work for uh what is it the coffee
company

03:44:10.610 --> 03:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
company
 
03:44:14.090 --> 03:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
um Starbucks they offer it nobody's
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing it
 
03:44:19.010 --> 03:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
where the problem comes in in my mind is
 
03:44:21.650 --> 03:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
forgetting about the cost for a minute
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has some of the best uh
 
03:44:26.809 --> 03:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
fertility or infertility Insurance in
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
the country they're among the 15 best
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
states in the country for for
 
03:44:30.720 --> 03:44:33.290 align:start position:0%
states in the country for for
infertility

03:44:33.290 --> 03:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
infertility
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
if we do something like this
 
03:44:38.090 --> 03:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that says in our
 
03:44:41.389 --> 03:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
laws is that we cannot provide any
 
03:44:41.399 --> 03:44:42.590 align:start position:0%
laws is that we cannot provide any
insurance

03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
and this is health insurance by the way
 
03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
any insurance to a heterosexual couple
 
03:44:50.150 --> 03:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
that cannot be provided to a same-sex
 
03:44:52.670 --> 03:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
couple it has to be the same
 
03:44:55.010 --> 03:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
but they limit it to medical insurance
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:01.849 --> 03:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
if a heterosexual couple
 
03:45:04.849 --> 03:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
wants to go the route that would result
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
from this being enacted that would mean
 
03:45:10.969 --> 03:45:10.979 align:start position:0%
that anybody
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
could then go
 
03:45:15.769 --> 03:45:15.779 align:start position:0%
and say well I don't want to have sex
 
03:45:18.110 --> 03:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
with my partner
 
03:45:20.570 --> 03:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
so I want the insurance if they're going
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
to make it equal so I want the insurance
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
company to pay for
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
the various uh procedures that can be
 
03:45:32.210 --> 03:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
done you know uh
 
03:45:34.370 --> 03:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
in vitro fertilization all that kind of
 
03:45:36.670 --> 03:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
stuff if we're going to make it equal
 
03:45:39.530 --> 03:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
then everybody can say well I think my
 
03:45:40.969 --> 03:45:40.979 align:start position:0%
husband is an ugly and I don't want
 
03:45:42.349 --> 03:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
anything to do with them so I'm gonna go
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
03:45:50.450 --> 03:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
and you can cancel that out
 
03:45:52.490 --> 03:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
but that but it but it really gets down
 
03:45:55.130 --> 03:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
to that if we make this equal where do
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
you draw the line
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay we're not debating this bill right
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
now I understand and we we absolutely
 
03:46:11.710 --> 03:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
as I remind everyone everything is now
 
03:46:16.330 --> 03:46:16.340 align:start position:0%
on YouTube
 
03:46:16.340 --> 03:46:18.190 align:start position:0%
on YouTube
Forever

03:46:18.190 --> 03:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
Forever
 
03:46:21.290 --> 03:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
I'm so old at this point forever is only
 
03:46:29.260 --> 03:46:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:29.270 --> 03:46:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:41.210 --> 03:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
right on that note okay
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
all right so what I have is that that we
 
03:46:51.050 --> 03:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a
 
03:46:51.060 --> 03:46:52.010 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a
um

03:46:52.010 --> 03:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
four day four week vacation from this
 
03:46:55.319 --> 03:46:56.269 align:start position:0%
four day four week vacation from this
committee

03:46:56.269 --> 03:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:46:59.570 --> 03:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
so we all come back on the 17th
 
03:46:59.580 --> 03:47:01.070 align:start position:0%
so we all come back on the 17th
and

03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:01.080 --> 03:47:03.050 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:47:03.050 --> 03:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
and just so you know what that does
 
03:47:08.090 --> 03:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
because I that following week I will be
 
03:47:12.170 --> 03:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh in Europe so that would mean uh okay
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
so we have two two e seventh in the 14
 
03:47:16.370 --> 03:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
yeah we definitely have two weeks after
 
03:47:20.570 --> 03:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
that into into November uh to uh take
 
03:47:22.910 --> 03:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know have the committee exec all
 
03:47:24.889 --> 03:47:24.899 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
um I want I would want to say is that um
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
the actions that the subcommittees did
 
03:47:30.840 --> 03:47:32.510 align:start position:0%
the actions that the subcommittees did
today

03:47:32.510 --> 03:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:47:32.520 --> 03:47:34.250 align:start position:0%
today
um

03:47:34.250 --> 03:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:37.130 --> 03:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
is is is obviously not cast in stone yet
 
03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
because the committee is not voted on it
 
03:47:41.690 --> 03:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
so in anyone if there's if there's a
 
03:47:43.250 --> 03:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
conversation or something and someone
 
03:47:46.010 --> 03:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
feels you know one way the other
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
um you know where it's obviously free
 
03:47:50.090 --> 03:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
free to be rediscussed
 
03:47:52.250 --> 03:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
at when we exec it but that I'm
 
03:47:54.290 --> 03:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
obviously I hope that when we get to the
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
exact session it'll be another one of
 
03:47:57.650 --> 03:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
our wonderful
 
03:47:59.870 --> 03:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh moving in move it out and get her
 
03:48:02.450 --> 03:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
done uh exact session so at this point
 
03:48:03.950 --> 03:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
we have one
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:14.150 --> 03:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
and then oh the excuse me uh we do have
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh some liquor bill one little liquor
 
03:48:20.090 --> 03:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
bill and we are waiting for the
 
03:48:22.250 --> 03:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
Department to
 
03:48:22.260 --> 03:48:23.210 align:start position:0%
Department to
um

03:48:23.210 --> 03:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:26.750 --> 03:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
to work it that out in terms of
 
03:48:29.690 --> 03:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
um and I know that there has been some
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
discussion around
 
03:48:32.040 --> 03:48:32.929 align:start position:0%
discussion around
um

03:48:32.929 --> 03:48:32.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the over serving you know
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
that it you know that with it you know
 
03:48:37.439 --> 03:48:38.210 align:start position:0%
that it you know that with it you know
the

03:48:38.210 --> 03:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:38.220 --> 03:48:39.710 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:48:39.710 --> 03:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of like uh the seventh you know
 
03:48:43.969 --> 03:48:43.979 align:start position:0%
where you get this the days 10 days 30
 
03:48:46.729 --> 03:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
days you know first first suspension
 
03:48:50.570 --> 03:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
second best the the underlying theme of
 
03:48:52.150 --> 03:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
course is that the Liquor Commission
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
definitely pursues every case
 
03:48:59.570 --> 03:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
uh and and so that that there was some
 
03:49:02.450 --> 03:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
conversation we want give them an up to
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
so that it's the severity of the case
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
that that could kick in the 30 days
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
that if it's if it's considered that
 
03:49:13.370 --> 03:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
that you know the commission is
 
03:49:15.290 --> 03:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
obviously and I would have to say that
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
if if someone you know anyone can appeal
 
03:49:19.250 --> 03:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
a commission's decision they actually
 
03:49:20.690 --> 03:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
can take it to court if you don't like
 
03:49:23.630 --> 03:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
the decision but that that if the court
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
if the commission you know feels the
 
03:49:29.450 --> 03:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
severity of the case I mean the reality
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
is you know we don't have a lot of this
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank God in New Hampshire that you know
 
03:49:35.090 --> 03:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
people dying
 
03:49:38.510 --> 03:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
um and so every time it does happen it
 
03:49:41.090 --> 03:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
it does feel severe and it feels you
 
03:49:44.030 --> 03:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
know uh but that there are extenuating
 
03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances and
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
um the commission definitely does its
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
homework and and research it and pursues
 
03:49:53.150 --> 03:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
it like a full legal case in terms of
 
03:49:55.070 --> 03:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
analyzing it and
 
03:49:57.290 --> 03:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
representative Terry
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh in complete agreement uh Mr
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
chairman with what you've just said uh
 
03:50:05.570 --> 03:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
but uh in addition I think to be a bit
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
more specific conversation was around
 
03:50:12.349 --> 03:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
recommending that there be a mandatory
 
03:50:12.359 --> 03:50:13.429 align:start position:0%
recommending that there be a mandatory
minimum

03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
03:50:15.769 --> 03:50:15.779 align:start position:0%
on the second offense of at least seven
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
days so that the discretion would fall
 
03:50:21.769 --> 03:50:21.779 align:start position:0%
between seven days and 30 days
 
03:50:24.050 --> 03:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you bye
 
03:50:26.150 --> 03:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
and Sullivan I know you care about this
 
03:50:28.190 --> 03:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
issue do you have any
 
03:50:30.290 --> 03:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
you want to weigh in on
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
no I'll be interested to see what they
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
have I mean
 
03:50:37.729 --> 03:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:39.469 --> 03:50:39.479 align:start position:0%
they could be unintended consequences if
 
03:50:39.479 --> 03:50:40.370 align:start position:0%
they could be unintended consequences if
we

03:50:40.370 --> 03:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
go really extreme on it and so I'll be
 
03:50:43.849 --> 03:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
curious to see what the language looks
 
03:50:45.769 --> 03:50:45.779 align:start position:0%
like I wouldn't be super comfortable
 
03:50:48.530 --> 03:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
with this potential bill would be
 
03:50:50.210 --> 03:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
putting restaurants out of business for
 
03:50:52.729 --> 03:50:52.739 align:start position:0%
an offense or whatever so but you know
 
03:50:54.170 --> 03:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
so I'll be curious to see what it is we
 
03:50:55.490 --> 03:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
can have that discussion when it comes I
 
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
think that I think everyone generally
 
03:50:58.969 --> 03:50:58.979 align:start position:0%
agrees if it was if it was the first
 
03:50:58.979 --> 03:51:00.349 align:start position:0%
agrees if it was if it was the first
offense

03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
offense
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard to imagine to go for a full
 
03:51:07.429 --> 03:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
30-day suspension but the underlying
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
could the underlying you know situation
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
been there with such blatant abuse that
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
they establishment should have known
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
sure and I think there was other things
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
that we talked about too like like time
 
03:51:19.010 --> 03:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
limits like if you have a first offense
 
03:51:22.130 --> 03:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
this year and then in 2031 we have a
 
03:51:23.630 --> 03:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
second offense right how the time the
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
time would be time there's a lot of
 
03:51:26.269 --> 03:51:26.279 align:start position:0%
things that we talked about that I think
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
we need to think about just because
 
03:51:31.250 --> 03:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be like yeah you
 
03:51:33.290 --> 03:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
a decade passes and they have another
 
03:51:35.570 --> 03:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
defense is that going to put or whatever
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know something that's been open for
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
40 years 50 years you don't want to be
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
like these things are going to happen no
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
matter what we can't right get rid of it
 
03:51:44.750 --> 03:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I do know that I am sponsored a bill
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
for the commission that uh is taking
 
03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
some of the rule making for some of the
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
license the ones like the tobacco and
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
taking it excuse me taking it out of
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
statutory and put it into rule making so
 
03:51:57.530 --> 03:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
that the department could be a little
 
03:51:59.090 --> 03:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
more flexible in terms of how they
 
03:52:01.849 --> 03:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
decide how do we do that so whether you
 
03:52:03.530 --> 03:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
think that's a good or bad diet idea
 
03:52:05.389 --> 03:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
we'll be talking about that this next
 
03:52:05.399 --> 03:52:07.010 align:start position:0%
we'll be talking about that this next
session

03:52:07.010 --> 03:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
um but I think everything comes down to
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
see what they've come up
 
03:52:12.590 --> 03:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I know they're working very hard on
 
03:52:14.510 --> 03:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
getting this concluded
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
so that would make another one for this
 
03:52:18.050 --> 03:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:52:18.060 --> 03:52:20.389 align:start position:0%
for the
17th

03:52:20.389 --> 03:52:20.399 align:start position:0%
17th
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:37.130 --> 03:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:37.140 --> 03:52:38.929 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:52:38.929 --> 03:52:38.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh enjoy your fall vacation
 
03:52:46.910 --> 03:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll see you in a couple weeks
 
03:52:46.920 --> 03:52:56.030 align:start position:0%
and we'll see you in a couple weeks
