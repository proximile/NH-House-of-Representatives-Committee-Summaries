Paige Lanza and Tripp are our members
 
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
um our goal today is to figure out
 
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.070 align:start position:0%
um our goal today is to figure out
um

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh what we're going to pursue in this
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill then we won't be doing anything
 
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.689 align:start position:0%
bill then we won't be doing anything
um

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.010 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh except perhaps some independent
 
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
research between July and August and
 
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 align:start position:0%
we'll be back together again as a
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh early in September
 
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.590 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh early in September
um

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
and does anyone on the committee have
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
anything they want to say at the
 
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.270 align:start position:0%
anything they want to say at the
beginning

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
so I had reached out to Richard Farrow
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
who is who does the investigations right
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
now just to understand better what he
 
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
actually was needing in order to do his
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
job and he was able to provide me with a
 
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
list of 13 kind of specific things that
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
he's looking into under the code of
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
conduct and I've passed them all down to
 
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
everybody so everybody should have a
 
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.029 align:start position:0%
everybody so everybody should have a
copy

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
copy
 
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
and I believe this would do this would
 
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 align:start position:0%
handle about
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
um 95 of of of what he does and so I
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
think this would be a good place perhaps
 
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
it's for us to start in looking in
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
because my sense from the group was that
 
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to make this
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
or that there was hesitation for making
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
a broad-based subpoena anything but more
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
we wanted it to be what was actually
 
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
needed we wanted to have some some
 
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
limitations on it so this is kind of a
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
draft of something perhaps that we could
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative page I don't know how the
 
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
chairperson wants to proceed in terms of
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
how we take these things up but I I'm
 
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 align:start position:0%
not quite there yet in terms of what um
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
delineating what if any subpoena power I
 
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
from my perspective I still it's still
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
unclear to me
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
what the need is what the Department's
 
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
not getting
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
you know I think as we recall the
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
history of the bill
 
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
or the amendment came through
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment it's a bit
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
contorted so from my perspective I'm
 
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
still I'm not quite at the
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
point of of
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
stipulating that there's a need for
 
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
because I don't I don't see it yet
 
00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
so that would be one
 
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
issue I would would like to sort of
 
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
understand better through the summer and
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
then in the fall thank you very much
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
um anyone else want to say something
 
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.969 align:start position:0%
um anyone else want to say something
next

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:08.930 align:start position:0%
next
um

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lanza yes thank you
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
um so I would also like to say the same
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
thing that I would like to
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
um not ready to just make any decisions
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
um today and I would like to have the
 
00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 align:start position:0%
summer to discuss
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
um kind of look it over a little bit
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
better and be able to come up with some
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
kind of decision
 
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
I have good news for you representative
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
land so we are not going to make any
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
decisions today and so you are on Solid
 
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
Ground we're just trying to figure out
 
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
what the uh
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
what the issues are
 
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
um as uh representative page indicated
 
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.529 align:start position:0%
um as uh representative page indicated
um

00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
the way this came forward wasn't a
 
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
traditional way
 
00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
um nonetheless because of how we do
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
things in New Hampshire all of these
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
proposals get get good consideration our
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp that I see that you
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
were in the can you wanted to say
 
00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.450 align:start position:0%
were in the can you wanted to say
something

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
yes good go to it the uh I spent the
 
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
last couple days uh
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
researching you know what what this is
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
and uh as as representative page has has
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh you know there was an
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that was brought forward which
 
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.649 align:start position:0%
amendment that was brought forward which
uh

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
I think was
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh a solution to one of the the issues
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
that uh Ed Brunton brought up by uh
 
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:48.380 align:start position:0%
uh people that had testified
 
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
I'm uh my my dilemma is uh
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh a uh civil rights complaint is a
 
00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
fairly broad area
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
and uh I I don't know what
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
uh what limits there would be
 
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
you know for uh
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education in
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
finally in a complaint for for a person
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
one of the the people that do not want
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
to file the complaint themselves so uh
 
00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:25.339 align:start position:0%
like everyone else I'm a a little
 
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
confused I guess so like it uh
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
so it's a good thing we have the summer
 
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
too we get I'm confused thank you well
 
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
either to get unconfused or more
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
confused I can't say which it's going to
 
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
be but it will be one or the other
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I've also handed out to you
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
um a document that um
 
00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:50.779 align:start position:0%
uh is based on material that I asked
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
Mr uh
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
lamp in OLS to prepare and that is to
 
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
tell us where
 
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.610 align:start position:0%
tell us where
um

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.769 align:start position:0%
um
what

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners have power of subpoena and
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
what are the circumstances under which
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
they have that power this is a document
 
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it doesn't have on it um
 
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:23.300 align:start position:0%
uh the source and and a date but it is
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
the research that was done by OLS and as
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
you look at it you can see um
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
um it's very specific
 
00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:36.949 align:start position:0%
um it's very specific
and

um the one in Environmental Services has
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
to do exclusively with issues relating
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%

so these are other than all the finance
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
ones these are very very narrow and very
 
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.769 align:start position:0%
ones these are very very narrow and very
specific

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:39.779 align:start position:0%

00:11:39.779 --> 00:11:40.550 align:start position:0%

um

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
powers of subpoena
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
that exhausts the as I understand it and
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
I do trust Rich to be very thorough that
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
these are all of the examples
 
00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
in state where a commissioner has the
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
power of subpoena of course we all know
 
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:04.940 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
has uh the power of subpoena and is
 
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.630 align:start position:0%
has uh the power of subpoena and is
um

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:16.820 align:start position:0%
uh by by law and custom
 
00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
the legal
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
services for every Department even those
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
departments that have their own legal
 
00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:29.509 align:start position:0%
departments that have their own legal
counsel

00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
um so that there might be some branches
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
of the Attorney General's office in each
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
of these agencies but the Attorney
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
General is at the top of the tree
 
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.509 align:start position:0%
General is at the top of the tree
um

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
representative I just I just noticed
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
that the liquor commissioner is missing
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
missing from this list so I just I
 
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
wanted us to maybe just add that to our
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
list it is RSA 179 uh 56. just so that
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
we're aware that's not on this list so
 
00:12:58.129 --> 00:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it was missed or that
 
00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.910 align:start position:0%
could be
um

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
because the Liquor Commission is not in
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
the traditional structure of
 
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:09.980 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in the government
 
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.069 align:start position:0%
 
free

00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
free
 
00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
to function in a slightly different way
 
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
and that might be why it was left off
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
the list but I thank you very much for
 
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.449 align:start position:0%
the list but I thank you very much for
that

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.459 --> 00:13:25.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
is there anything you would like to
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
please sit down
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
I mean you know you could talk about the
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
rain I want to point out to everyone
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
that it has not yet rained 40 days and
 
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
40 nights so
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
put on the bike and tell us who you are
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
just press that button down in the front
 
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
there you go okay my name is Richard
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
Farrell I'm an investigator for the
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I just began my
 
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
11th year doing this prior to that I
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
spent 30 years with the New Hampshire
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
State Police as a an investigator
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
trooper I know you appeared before the
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
committee when we heard the bill yes um
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we very much appreciated your
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
testimony then so one of the questions
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
um one of the problems that we're having
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
is that as litigation increases between
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
school districts and school districts
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys superintendents and their
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
legal teams we are getting some
 
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
roadblocks put up to get information
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
concerning educated misconduct and I
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
provided 12 at the in the initial
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
hearing it was a little bit broad-based
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
we've tried to give you 12 examples
 
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
within the code of conduct to break it
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
down to be more specific and what we'd
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
be looking for
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem is that we are not
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
getting the information uh sometimes
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
from the school districts or the charter
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
schools their attorneys are telling us
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
that it's protected it's heavily
 
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
redacted sometimes they don't provide it
 
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:19.860 align:start position:0%
at all what we have been given on
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
occasion is the opportunity to come into
 
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
a legal office
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
to a conference room where we are given
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review an internal
 
00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:30.290 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to review an internal
document

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
and we're told we cannot get a copy of
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
the internal document we cannot take uh
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
any uh copies of it uh we can make notes
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
from it and when the time comes for us
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
to go to take an action against an
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
educator or an in action against an
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
educator the attorneys for Nea for
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
example or American Federation of
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
teachers really good friends and we work
 
00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:55.820 align:start position:0%
very well with them most of the time
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
they look at us and say show us the
 
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.290 align:start position:0%
they look at us and say show us the
report

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
well I can't give them the report
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't given to me
 
00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
we've been brought into school districts
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
and here here you go here's the report
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
you cannot take it you cannot copy it
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
you cannot have it
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
in the discovery process under under the
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
due process rights the Educators have
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
requires us to provide all discovery
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
from our reports and any documents
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the alleged misconduct
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
to their Union attorneys
 
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
I can't provide it because they won't
 
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
provide it to me and a subpoena power
 
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
would allow us in limited circumstances
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
to get that internal document and
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
provide it in the course of the due
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
process rights that Educators have for
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
uh hearings
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
if we don't have it
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
we can't do it we can't provide it and
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
then it becomes significantly
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
problematic many times we had found
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves in that position I can recall
 
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
one instance in particular
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
we had the intention for us was to take
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
a certain action against an educator and
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't provide Discovery to
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
the educator and and his legal team we
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
negotiated the settlement that was far
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
less agreed file less serious than we
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
would have liked and sure enough within
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
two years that educator was back in
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
front of us with a similar alleged
 
00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:26.030 align:start position:0%
front of us with a similar alleged
misconduct

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
if we had had the subpoena power and the
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
full document to provide in Discovery we
 
00:17:33.169 --> 00:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
may have had a different result and in
 
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
in these instances what we're talking
 
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.529 align:start position:0%
in these instances what we're talking
about

00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:36.539 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
we're talking about whether or not some
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
teachers very small minority of teachers
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
engage in physical emotional sexual harm
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
to children and that's what we're trying
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
to focus on and that's the list of uh
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
the 12 items that we tried to break it
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
down and be more specific for you in our
 
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
document thank you very much you said
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
many times
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
um Can can you give me an idea of how
 
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.450 align:start position:0%
um Can can you give me an idea of how
often

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.110 align:start position:0%
often
um

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
but you have met with resistance in
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get information that you feel
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
is necessary I I met with resistance
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
this week
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
and trying to get information from a a
 
00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
source and we're negotiating I'm still
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
so close that I can get it but what
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
about in a month or a year or in a year
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
probably and keep in mind these are the
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
most egregious circumstances these are
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
the circumstances where there's
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate harm to children legitimate
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
harm in many instances sexual misconduct
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
and where you believe there is where we
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
believe the allegation requires us to
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
complete a thorough investigation right
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
and keep in mind
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
many times these allegations don't rise
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the level of a criminal act because
 
00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
we work very closely with our law
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement Partners but they violate
 
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct where there's
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
grooming technique where there's
 
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
boundary issues where they violate Local
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
District policy and also the code of
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
conduct so in a course of of the year
 
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.990 align:start position:0%
conduct so in a course of of the year
um

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
how would you define many cases right
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
now we have from January 1st till now
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
we've drawn 55 cases
 
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
that 55 cases where where the total
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
cases where there is no cooperation no
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
55 total cases and within that 55 total
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
cases I would I would guess we're
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
looking at negotiations involving 10 of
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
the 55 cases where we're trying to get
 
00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
more information and keep in mind
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes this information that we're
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
searching for isn't it doesn't
 
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.990 align:start position:0%
searching for isn't it doesn't
um

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't rise to the level of a
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
misconduct allegation or misconduct
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
charge it exonerates the educator and
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that I really
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
think you should be aware of many of
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
these cases come in we get the
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
information we're looking for and we
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
exonerate the educator as opposed to
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
take sanctions against them so in the
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
course of I would say in the course of a
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
year with a hundred drawn cases in a
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
full cases that we draw our numbers for
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
there are probably
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
15 cases where we have to negotiate very
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
strongly to try and get the information
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
that we need okay thank you that that's
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
very helpful and and can you help me
 
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.150 align:start position:0%
very helpful and and can you help me
understand

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
why in those cases where you believe you
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
have strong reason to pursue them
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General's power
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
um is not helpful to you well I've done
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
the research on this and I've been
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
knocking on this door for for over 10
 
00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
years now and I'm told that the Attorney
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
General's office does not have the
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
authority to seek a subpoena for a third
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
party investigation or a third party
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
division or section of government that's
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
what we're told if if in fact it was
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
true if it were true that they would
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
provide subpoena power for us then I
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
would have done that 10 years ago
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
but they don't if I remember what
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
when you when you appeared before us and
 
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
you had a lot of information for us then
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
um you said that this 10 years ago this
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem that people cooperated
 
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't have had a case that
 
00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:27.299 align:start position:0%
it's been more recent 10 years ago we
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
had a greater cooperation in the front
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
end of Investigations and as time has
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
progressed uh that cooperation level has
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
changed uh the world is the world has
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
changed yes it certainly has there's no
 
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:42.539 align:start position:0%
question about it
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I certainly hope so if it's for the
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
good but a lot of it isn't
 
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.590 align:start position:0%
good but a lot of it isn't
um

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
the investigations that you conduct yes
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
these are all directly related to code
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
of conduct violations correct are there
 
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
any other investigations types or is it
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
strictly code of conduct so the only
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
other thing outside of the code of
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
conduct that I would involve myself in
 
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
is assisting the Bureau of credentialing
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
with criminal background checks to say
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
to clarify for example here's a criminal
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
background check on a new teacher
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
candidate and they're confused as to
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
what the background what the criminal
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
background check says so I'll I'll
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
assist them by saying look Nel Pros
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
means it doesn't exist anymore so it
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
looks like a very heinous event or crime
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
that's been charged and I would come
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
down and say no no this no longer exists
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
and you'll look at the arrest date you
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
look at the disposition date and the
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
disposition is no prostate dismissed so
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
I help them guide them through criminal
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
background checks but other than that my
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
investigation is a code of conduct
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
violations and there are five sections
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
of the code of conduct and I that's
 
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's my Lane code of conduct
 
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.409 align:start position:0%
that's my Lane code of conduct
uh

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
fine thank you uh one of the uh as I
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
uh I've been doing a bit of research on
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
on this because I I thought it was
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a little bit prepared uh
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things I believe I read is
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
when there is a complaint
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh it is typically given to
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh the superintendent or a designee
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
they will conduct the investigation on
 
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct or or whatever the
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
complaint is about uh is that something
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
truth to it well the superintendents and
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
school districts had the obligation and
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
the duty to investigate violations of
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
their policies and procedures which they
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
do and sometimes those violations of
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
policies of procedures intersect with
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct and it's in those
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
instances where we work together with
 
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
the school superintendents with their
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
designated persons which includes
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
third-party law firms or investigators
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
and it's when policy and code of conduct
 
00:24:26.529 --> 00:24:26.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
it's representative Paige
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thanks welcome again
 
00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:34.909 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thanks welcome again
um

00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble following all this to
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
be frank
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
um because from the beginning we had a
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill dealing with Human Rights
 
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.370 align:start position:0%
bill dealing with Human Rights
Commission

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
violations and then we have now a
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
non-germaine amendment that we're we're
 
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
dealing with with subpoena power
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
if my recollection serves I wouldn't
 
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
guarantee it but we can go back and
 
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.570 align:start position:0%
guarantee it but we can go back and
check

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
when you were here and whenever it was
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
March or February you indicated to the
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee that you were successful with
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
your job I am
 
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:09.059 align:start position:0%
and that the idea of a subpoena power
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
would be a prospective power another I
 
00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.230 align:start position:0%
would be a prospective power another I
think

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
I think attorney Fenton might have used
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
the term tool toolbox but I'm not sure
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
that that was that was the position at
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
that at that point is that
 
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
Fair it's fair to say that during my 10
 
00:25:24.539 --> 00:25:25.789 align:start position:0%
Fair it's fair to say that during my 10
years

00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
we have had some cooperation we have had
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
great cooperation from some places and
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
districts we've had less from others I'm
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty good at my job and I try the
 
00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:39.419 align:start position:0%
best I can to accomplish the mission But
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
as time has progressed closer to today
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
I'm getting more and more pushback
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
from entities that are not giving us the
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
full information that we're asking for
 
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
and I understand it completely
 
00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of litigation
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
involved the unions involved the
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
people's lives are involved and
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
I just am running into more difficulty
 
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
getting information that will either
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
help teachers out of a jam or
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
move forward to keep teachers that
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be around kids around kids
 
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.310 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be around kids around kids
so

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
if I could continue do I need can I just
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
run a little bit sure for not too long I
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
don't don't worry
 
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
um if I stand up and leave okay that's
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
good that's good so so I guess I'll ask
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
an open-ended question I mean
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
what what somewhat open is a dangerous
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
one I guess if it's open-ended but
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
you know what what's changed I mean are
 
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
the school districts now recalcitrin to
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
to investigate or help the doe find
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
people who might be violating some of
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
these uh Provisions I mean these are
 
00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:50.039 align:start position:0%
pretty serious
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
let me I mean these are pretty serious
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions here I I I'm having a tough
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
time seeing why a school superintendent
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
would find it in their interest or a
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
school district to
 
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
not ask or not not be helpful if they
 
00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
had information setting aside whether
 
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
they're mandatory reporters setting
 
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
aside the employment consequences that
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
they're probably investigating if these
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
things are any close to being true I
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
mean what what's changed that would
 
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
position assuming there's a number of
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
them out there superintendents the
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
school districts from striking the
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
posture that we're not going to
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
cooperate that's that's not the posture
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
the superintendent's taking
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
superintendents want to cooperate
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
cooperate to the greatest level possible
 
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
however many superintendents are
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
designating the investigations to law
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
firms or third-party investigators and
 
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
that's where the greatest problem comes
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
in I'll give you an example we were
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
brought in to a local school district
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
where there was a sexual misconduct of a
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
young boy by a a coach
 
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.190 align:start position:0%
young boy by a a coach
and

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
we looked at the chain of command and
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
how the report was failed to come
 
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
through their inner chain of command
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
they missed a lot of steps and they
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
reported It ultimately because they
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
became aware of it and he the
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
superintendent cooperated to the
 
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:14.700 align:start position:0%
greatest level and extent possible
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
there was an internal report done that
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
documented from A to Z
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
what happened when it happened the dates
 
00:28:24.049 --> 00:28:24.059 align:start position:0%
the times the locations and we were
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
offered the opportunity to go into a law
 
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
firm sit at a uh a conference send in a
 
00:28:30.409 --> 00:28:30.419 align:start position:0%
conference room in the conference room
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
desk they gave us a document they said
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
take all the time you need you can't you
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
can't copy it you can't disseminate it
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
take what you want
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
we want to take action against an
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
educator involved in the misconduct the
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
first question we got from the attorney
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
representing the educator was show us
 
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
the discovery
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
they knew there was a there was a third
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
party investigation
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
show us the discovery I couldn't show
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
them the discovery because we were not
 
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
allowed to have the discovery so we we
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
had to go by notes
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
go by parent interviews go by student
 
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
interviews and we were able to get
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
something out of that misconduct the
 
00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:13.940 align:start position:0%
allegation but we weren't able to get
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
what should have happened
 
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:18.860 align:start position:0%
you're all familiar with the the
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
conquered case the infamous conquered
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
case uh where Mr lewing has now just
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
pleaded guilty to multiple constant
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
sexual assault involving a middle school
 
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.450 align:start position:0%
sexual assault involving a middle school
girl

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
girl
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
we were not allowed to have that copies
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
of that information the superintendent
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
the principal the superintendent This
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
legal team for the for the district
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
initially did not give us any of that
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
information then we would had difficulty
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
trying to get uh information from the
 
00:29:48.289 --> 00:29:48.299 align:start position:0%
local police that wasn't redacted
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
we we were successful ultimately in
 
00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
getting the license revoked but it took
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
us a far longer to do it
 
00:29:59.330 --> 00:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
it took us great far more difficulty in
 
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
getting it done and Discovery again
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
became a problem
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
so the thing that's changed is that the
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
school district attorneys are now saying
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
don't give this information
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
or they're allowing you to review it in
 
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:15.539 align:start position:0%
camera if you will correct so you are
 
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
seeing it you are seeing the data the
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
evidence the we're seeing the
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
information dates so
 
00:30:21.299 --> 00:30:22.730 align:start position:0%
information dates so
so

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
is there has there been a change in and
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
maybe there's someone from the school
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
boards that could help us with this but
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
has there been a change in
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
litigation Theory where the school
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
districts up until you know two years
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
ago have now decided they're
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
going to take this approach assuming
 
00:30:39.889 --> 00:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
that's what they're doing again it's not
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
all it's some and there is a there is a
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
change and there is a concern for
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
litigation and I think that that's where
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
the holdup is and allowing us to have
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
subpoena power to go in and get that
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
full document for full Discovery would
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
be helpful in going after or exonerating
 
00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
Educators or going after the education
 
00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be there anymore so just one
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
one more if you don't mind it when there
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
are other ways to get you know there are
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
other ways to get the information
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
outside of the document that you review
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
in a school district office right I mean
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
if you were able to and I don't mean to
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
be testy about it but I'm but I'm trying
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
to understand if you see the document
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
with the information
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be if that is valuable
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
information you've got it
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
right and so you have a way to figure
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
out and that may be part of the
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
investigative process and assuming this
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
has happened assuming it's happened on
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
multiple cases but I would be curious to
 
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
to get more information on that but
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
you know if if you've seen the document
 
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
in the room with the information
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
you have the information just not in the
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
document well we have the information we
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
don't have the document which means the
 
00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539 align:start position:0%
the the the the other side the attorneys
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
representing the accused educator are
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
looking for that document
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
and we can't give it to them but you
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
would and I'm I'll you would be able to
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
verify that information or seek and
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
invest through your own investigate
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
process to be able to sort of whatever
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
the document says about whomever and
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
whenever to sort of use this sleuthing
 
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220 align:start position:0%
power to to probably figure out that and
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
get it without that and be able I can
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
independently well first of all the
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
document is heavily redacted so that's
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
part of the problem
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
it's all very definitely redacted in
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
terms of FERPA protections of students
 
00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:31.140 align:start position:0%
the other problem is the the people that
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
are representing the educator know it
 
00:32:33.059 --> 00:32:34.310 align:start position:0%
are representing the educator know it
exists

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
and I can't give it to them
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
so I can go out I can do everything I
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
can I can go find the kid I can go find
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
the parents I can go find the Educators
 
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
and try and fill in the missing pieces
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
which I do
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
but sometimes I don't
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day any good
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
attorney is going to in the discovery
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
process say where are the documents
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
and if I can't provide them then we're
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
now in a negotiating phase
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
I guess there are more than one ways to
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
establish a fact besides the document
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
that's produced by the school district
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
but what you've just said you were able
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll stop and I know representative
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
Tripp has some questions
 
00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:19.610 align:start position:0%
Tripp has some questions
apparently

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.169 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
you say that the uh the investigation
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
which uh is
 
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:30.380 align:start position:0%
initiated by the superintendent no
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
investigations for us are not initiated
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
by the superintendent the investigations
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
are initiated by superintendents
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
self-reporting which they are required
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
to do if they're aware of it they come
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
to us from the police they come to us
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
from Individual individual parents they
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
come from us from dcyf reports
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
those are how we get our investigations
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
some some are self-reported by the
 
00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.029 align:start position:0%
some some are self-reported by the
superintendent

00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's true and the superintendents do
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
conduct investigations they either
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
designate someone within the chain of
 
00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
command if the school is big enough the
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
school district is big enough or they
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
hire third party either law firms or
 
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
third party investigators to come in and
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
conduct those investigations
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
so they do conduct investigations but
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
they're not the only source of
 
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.930 align:start position:0%
they're not the only source of
Investigations

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
Investigations
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
I went I called a superintendent on
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
Monday of this week and said we have a
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
problem I have a report from dcyf
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
indicating that one of your staff
 
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.020 align:start position:0%
members is engaged in misconduct
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
superintendent said what are you talking
 
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.869 align:start position:0%
superintendent said what are you talking
about

00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
and at that point I gave him the
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
information over the phone he goes I'll
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
be in touch with my attorney I'll be in
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
touch with you we'll start our internal
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
investigation that's how that works
 
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes the opposite occurs where the
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
superintendent says calls the phone and
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
said Rich we have a problem I put a
 
00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:47.339 align:start position:0%
teacher on an admin leave today this is
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
the allegation we're going to start an
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
internal process and then we parallel
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
that if it's a if it is a code of
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
conduct violation very narrow
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
if it's code of conduct violation
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
that's how it works it's not one size
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
fits all and the information comes to us
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
from multiple sources five in particular
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
and many times they come from Individual
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
parents and this time of year you'd be
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
amazed at how many complaints commit
 
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
parents are hypersensitive to
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
retaliation against their children they
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
wait until school's out and the phone
 
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
rings off the hook
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
this is what happened to my child this
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
week this is what happened to my child
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
in February we're getting those kinds of
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
complaints and then we reach back out to
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
the superintendents so the
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
superintendent does his his or her job
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
but that's not the only source of our
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
information and that's the only those
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
again please yes uh you mentioned
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
several times that there's lawyers
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
involved are are the lawyers
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
working for
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
the superintendent
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
the Union
 
00:35:59.569 --> 00:35:59.579 align:start position:0%
or the teacher all of the above all the
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
above so there could be a number of
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:13.609 align:start position:0%
 
when

00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:15.410 align:start position:0%
when
um

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
you talk about initiating against
 
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.890 align:start position:0%
you talk about initiating against
subpoena

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
who is being subpoenaed who or what
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
so what documents Instagram do you know
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
every sexual misconduct case involving
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
an educated allegation again involving
 
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
an educator every single one of those
 
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.099 align:start position:0%
allegations begins with social media
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
every single one of them
 
00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
and we have no access to social media
 
00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
this would not change it at all sure it
 
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:49.790 align:start position:0%
this would not change it at all sure it
would

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
we could reach out and subpoena
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:07.460 align:start position:0%
we know that there's significant
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty in um
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
you have to understand that I'm a
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
Luddite I I do not believe in social
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
media I think social media it provides
 
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
much more of a negative presence in our
 
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
society than a positive presence I do
 
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
not use social media I do not have a
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
social media account all that but I know
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
how important social media is in terms
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
of how people get information I also
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
know that it's very difficult
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
to get to subpoena social media to get
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
the results that you need
 
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.930 align:start position:0%
the results that you need
um

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
why having
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
of any agency have the power to subpoena
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
is more likely to achieve success than
 
00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
having the Attorney General
 
00:38:10.859 --> 00:38:12.890 align:start position:0%
having the Attorney General
subpoena

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
subpoena
 
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.270 align:start position:0%
subpoena
and

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
I also don't think he'll have success
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
but that's beside the point um
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
am I wrong on that well first of all
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
right now we have no access
 
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
and sometimes if a crime has occurred
 
00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
involving a teacher
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement will take the action
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
they need to to try and preserve the
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
information on social media and then get
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
it which happened in the the conquered
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
case for example and then we were able
 
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
to at some point we were able to get
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
some of that information for the
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
licensing issue because all we care
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
about is the licensing issue so it is
 
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
possible to get it through subpoena
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
right now I have no access to it
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever especially if no crime has
 
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.310 align:start position:0%
whatsoever especially if no crime has
occurred

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem we have a case
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
right now that came in on on last Friday
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're working on it now the Educators
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
out on administrative leave and what
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
we've already determined is that the
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
educator was sending pictures of himself
 
00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
in various stages to a 16 year old girl
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
and the 16 year old girl was likewise
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
sending images of herself to the
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
educator now we we have a problem with
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
that alleged too no it's no it's not
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
alleged any longer okay I just okay fine
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
so it's not alleged in any way shape or
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
form it's there we we have gotten access
 
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
to it because of the parent that
 
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
provided it provided that information to
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
us and so what power what would subpoena
 
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
power give you that you don't have now
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
potentially getting the information from
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
potentially getting the information from
 
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:50.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
especially in the instances where
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's no crime alleged
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
where the of Educators violating
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries but hasn't committed a crime
 
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
really yeah 16 year old
 
00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:09.410 align:start position:0%
really yeah 16 year old
well

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative give it a question
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
I just I wanted to point out I think
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
that there's kind of some crossoverlap
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
here because
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
when the bill originally came in it was
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
really to put
 
00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:25.220 align:start position:0%
it was to give the authority of the
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
education or commissioner to put rights
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
over to the Human Rights Commission and
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
it wasn't really related to the code of
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
conduct it was more related to
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination and I think that that's
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
why that there's some confusion but now
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
when we got the non-germaine amendment
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
it was something that was completely
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
unrelated to that and this isn't towards
 
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
looking into
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination but this is more like for
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
you to do your job looking into
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
um mainly the list that you gave us is
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect is that a correct
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is kind of an
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
entirely separate thing than what we're
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
originally looking at in the non when
 
00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
the non-germain amendment was made that
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
the Discrimination piece isn't really
 
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at now now it's
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
really to get into the code of conduct
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
for abuse and neglect is that correct
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
it's just to clarify it's not really
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking for it's what I'm asking
 
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.450 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking for it's what I'm asking
for

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh we're not involved in hb2 whatsoever
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're not involved in any of the
 
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
provisions for the Human Rights
 
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
Commission we're not involved in the
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
discrimination case that's not in the
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
code of conduct
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
therefore that's nothing to do with me
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
and since hb2 was passed I have
 
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
investigated exactly zero cases involved
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
with hb2 zero
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
to what are you referring human rights
 
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.410 align:start position:0%
to what are you referring human rights
discrimination

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.130 align:start position:0%
discrimination
um

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
the the things that people are most
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about as it involved in House
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
Bill too the the the idea that we're
 
00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
going to come in and investigate
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
allegations of
 
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.569 align:start position:0%
allegations of
um

00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination racial discrimination
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
lgbtq that's not my wheelhouse that's
 
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
not what I do that's not in the code of
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
conduct that's not what I do but there's
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
nothing in hb2 that well that's the
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
so-called hb2 I just I just spent nine
 
00:42:22.849 --> 00:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
and a half hours being deposed by the
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
ACLU and all we talked about was hb2 but
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
well you must be exhausted I can
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
understand that but if what you're
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
talking about
um

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't we'll let that go by I
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
mean I can explain so there I have the
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
memo on it that actually came from uh
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
the doj so it was
 
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.250 align:start position:0%
the doj so it was
um

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
it was hb2 it's just saying that
 
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.210 align:start position:0%
it was hb2 it's just saying that
um

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
the parts that he's saying that he can't
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
look into from hb2 were the teaching of
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
the children that
 
00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:54.410 align:start position:0%
the children that
um

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
a certain identified group is inherently
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
Superior inferior to people of another
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
identified group or sexist or whatever
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and those are the the pieces that
 
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
he's saying that he's not looking into
 
00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:09.020 align:start position:0%
that came from hb2 that went into RSA
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
193. correct and in fact
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
to all of our knowledge
 
00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.770 align:start position:0%
to all of our knowledge
um

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
there is there anyone in any school
 
00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.690 align:start position:0%
there is there anyone in any school
district

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
um that um
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
teaches that one group is Superior or
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
inferior to another I have no idea I
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative page
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.849 align:start position:0%
um is
um

00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
if this is a plausible line of thought
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
that although we started with the doe
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
having some sort of prosecutorial powers
 
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
for H for the divisive Concepts law that
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
was the original Bill we then had a
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment dealing with
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
subpoena powers
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't all together at least from my
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
perspective wasn't altogether clear what
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
the need was in fact
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
you know you seem very successful at
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
getting the information and getting
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of bad situations
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
um but I'm wondering if you if you could
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
just take off your investigator hat for
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
a moment and
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
is it plausible to think that there
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
might be a healthy degree of skepticism
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
given the track record of how the bill
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
and the amendment came in and
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
what seems to be a very politically
 
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.710 align:start position:0%
what seems to be a very politically
contentious

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
situation between
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
teachers and and the commission at the
 
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.829 align:start position:0%
teachers and and the commission at the
department

00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
at the moment you're right the first
 
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.710 align:start position:0%
at the moment you're right the first
time

00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner right yeah so okay well
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
so so yes so it does seem I wonder if
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
you'd grant that it's a plausible
 
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
um line of thought to think of the the
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill with the current political
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
situation I understand your your
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
position I understand your question uh
 
00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:16.859 align:start position:0%
it was not my decision at all to have
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
this as an amendment to that bill
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
um I understand completely why there's
 
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.569 align:start position:0%
um I understand completely why there's
concern

00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm just telling you what I do and
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
how I do it uh frankly
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a tool that we need and
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the litigious society
 
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
that we're in I think it's definitely
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
necessary but I can understand your
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
position and anyone else's position all
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you have a Human Rights
 
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
Commission action and now you're
 
00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:47.099 align:start position:0%
sticking a subpoena palette to it and
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
the first thing you would think of and
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
if if I were a teacher in the field I
 
00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
would think okay so the commissioner the
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
department is trying to get subpoena
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
power for that and it's not the case I
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it was a wise move
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
to do the amendment the way it was done
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not my call it's not my job I'm
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
just trying to testify as to I need and
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I want to stick to I
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
of course we'll see you again Ashley
 
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.829 align:start position:0%
of course we'll see you again Ashley
representative

00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
I know that there are people that are
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
probably going to be upset with this
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
do you sense that uh
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:40.309 align:start position:0%
in the
the

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
it's more important to protect teachers
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
now than it is to protect the students
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
no I don't I don't agree with that I
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
think everyone wants to protect kids
 
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
I think there's that's the number one
 
00:46:53.569 --> 00:46:53.579 align:start position:0%
Focus I think superintendents the
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
lawyers representing them the
 
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
investigators school boards everyone
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
wants to to protect the kids and I
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
disagree with the notion that it's uh
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
the we're spending too much time uh
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
protecting teachers I I just disagree
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
with the premise I think that this is a
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
politically sensitive topic
 
00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to do my job to
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
protect kids from teachers that are
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
predators that shouldn't be in
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
classrooms and the idea that teachers
 
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:23.099 align:start position:0%
are the problem are that people
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
representing teaches the problem that's
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely wrong categorically wrong
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
everyone is focusing on the health and
 
00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
the safety of the kids it's just how we
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
get there
 
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you anything else thank you very
 
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:37.910 align:start position:0%
thank you anything else thank you very
much

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
um chairman Ladd did you have anything
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
you wanted to contribute to this
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
conversation I I see you're here and I
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
would you come come up so that we could
 
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.370 align:start position:0%
would you come come up so that we could
yes

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:04.099 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd who's chairman of
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Rick Ladd I
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
chair House Education here in Concord
 
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:18.710 align:start position:0%
chair House Education here in Concord
um

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
I'm here primarily to listen and to
 
00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
become more familiar with what we have
 
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
going on in this particular bill
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
I I just you know hope everybody has a
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
copy of this booklet right here
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
this is the code of ethics and code of
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
conduct for New Hampshire Educators I I
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
have an extra copy I could provide the
 
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
committee here and I think it's worthy
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
that you have that we would very much
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
um back in 2022 we had a bill come
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
before the education committee which was
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
not this bill of course but it was HP
 
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
1336 and through our study and looking
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
in that and working with teachers
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
and school administrators and the school
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
board we saw some issues within the code
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
of conduct when it comes to reprimand or
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
suspension or revoking revoking the
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
credential that there's probably another
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
level that has to be considered and it's
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
in the letter that I wrote right here
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
this administrative letter to the
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
department based upon the
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the House Education
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
committee we rather see things taken
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
care of through the rulemaking process
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
than through stash story changes so I'll
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
I'll get a copy of this maybe I can give
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
a copy to Jen Jen could make a copy for
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
you so you can see that we have been
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
discussing the code of conduct
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not a perfect document but it's
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
one that we put in place several years
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
ago because we recognize the need to be
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
Havoc conduct in terms of the student
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
parents the community the profession
 
00:49:54.829 --> 00:49:54.839 align:start position:0%
and I think it's been a very valuable
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
instrument that we've had since then uh
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
I I either probably is a need that we
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
look at some of that and especially when
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
it comes to the latter part the
 
00:50:07.809 --> 00:50:07.819 align:start position:0%
reporting stages and the uh discipline
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
when you see an issue that may or may
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
not be going on so I'll stop right there
 
00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
I was here primarily today Madam chair
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
to listen see where we're going with
 
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.349 align:start position:0%
to listen see where we're going with
this

00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much and those two
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
items your letter yeah um and and the uh
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
this letter was written on behalf of the
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
committee but at the recommendation of a
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
small group in which we met and I
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
believe one of those that met with us is
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
um directly behind me and uh I think
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
it's where we all were at that time and
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
probably still are in terms of the
 
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
change that we were recommending
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's very very
 
00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.450 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's very very
helpful

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
um and and we have heard before you came
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
in that we're talking about a very small
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
number of cases
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
um where the level of cooperation isn't
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
what we would all
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh hope for but even though it's small
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
it still has to be acknowledged that's
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
correct we thank you very much and I I
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
think um our wonderful researcher can
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
help make sure that we all have copies
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
of both yes thank you very much thank
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
um representative Perez you indicated
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
Christine Perez I'm speaking as a parent
 
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:38.460 align:start position:0%
as a grandparent and um
 
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:41.099 align:start position:0%
as an individual who has seen things
 
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:44.339 align:start position:0%
that have gone wrong
 
00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:46.700 align:start position:0%
to answer a question about why now
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
because during covid
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
when parents were sitting with their
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
children at home while the children were
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
being educated a lot of things came out
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they became more aware of things
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
that were going on at the school so
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
started digging a lot deeper so I
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
personally I believe that that's one of
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
the reason on my way up here I saw one
 
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
of the big neon signs that we put up
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
that said I think 45 traffic deaths this
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
year one is too many I want you to think
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
about the fact that one one
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
teacher that has hurt a child and is
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
allowed to continue is one too many so
 
00:52:32.089 --> 00:52:32.099 align:start position:0%
the number
 
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned of how many he
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
does it just takes one one of the
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
problems that happens and it's my
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
understanding in speaking at the
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and talking to
 
00:52:49.329 --> 00:52:49.339 align:start position:0%
them is sometimes the questionable
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
Acts or questionable
 
00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.930 align:start position:0%
Acts or questionable
um

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:52.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
encounter never make it to the DOE they
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
get negotiated with at the principal and
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
superintendent level and then
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
they get to make an agreement and it
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
gets sealed
 
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
and that never makes it to the DOE
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
and then that teacher might go to
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
another District
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
and have the same type of activity
 
00:53:19.559 --> 00:53:20.750 align:start position:0%
and have the same type of activity
happen

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
and it never makes it to the DOE
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about criminal I'm
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
talking about just perhaps under
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
criminal but inappropriate education for
 
00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
a kid and it gets sealed again
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
so by the time perhaps it might reach
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
the doe there may be two or three sealed
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
that were never brought forward but yet
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
this educator or employee was allowed to
 
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.589 align:start position:0%
this educator or employee was allowed to
go

00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.890 --> 00:53:59.900 align:start position:0%
those things if perhaps the doe
 
00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:02.339 align:start position:0%
hypothetically became aware that there
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
might have been something and goes back
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
to a previous school if that
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
superintendent refuses to give it they
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
have no information for it
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
I want you to think about the fact that
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
most Educators do not do break the code
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
of conduct most Educators don't
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
most doctors are good too and I was a
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
nurse for 42 years most of them but
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
there have been nurses that have been
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
nurse Killers we've seen movies about it
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
it just takes one and to it make it
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
easier for them to do their job to stop
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
this from happening to another child I
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
think is very important
 
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.530 align:start position:0%
think is very important
um

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
things are much different than they were
 
00:54:56.089 --> 00:54:56.099 align:start position:0%
a few years ago and I think parents do
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Pat or the part about having your
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
child's a Target on your child's back
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
has been going on for many years I have
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
a 43 year old daughter I was on the
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
Hollis School Board she was in sixth
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
grade I voted against a raise her sixth
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
grade teacher
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
would not let her go to the bathroom
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
her sixth grade teacher would not answer
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
her when she raised her hands to the
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
point where my her father and I had to
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer and go to a school this
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
was in a little tiny town of Brookline
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
back in sixth grade 92
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
so parents are afraid to speak up and
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's why he's being inundated at this
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
time be aware Please be aware and
 
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
consider that there are teachers and
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
there are staff members that are not
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
perfect and these people need to be able
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
to do their job to protect
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
that's who we're here to protect the
 
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
child and sometimes allegations can be
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
made against a staff member that are
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
unwarranted by a angry parent so you're
 
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
not only protecting the child
 
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:16.140 align:start position:0%
but in some cases you could be
 
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.510 align:start position:0%
but in some cases you could be
protecting

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
the staff member as well against
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
unwarranted allegations so I just ask
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
you to keep those things in mind thank
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
you very much any questions thank you
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
very much is there anyone else here who
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and good afternoon
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
members of of the subcommittee my name
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
is Barrett Christine I'm the executive
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire school
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
boards Association
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
um by way of background I was on the
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
committee that wrote the code of conduct
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
back in I believe 2018 it was
 
00:56:59.569 --> 00:56:59.579 align:start position:0%
um and um I also want to uh just on
 
00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:00.839 align:start position:0%
behalf of the school boards Association
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
want to thank Mr Farrell for his time
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
and effort and in working basically to
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
protect kids which is
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly what what I tell
 
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
school words all the time aside from
 
00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
academics see your first priority is to
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that kids are safe when
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're when they're within the walls of
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
your school
 
00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:21.380 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot to unpack here
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
I've got a lot of different thoughts but
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
I want to be mindful of the committee's
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
time today and perhaps bring some of
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
those thoughts back at a subsequent
 
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
meeting but
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
um I want to go back to the beginning
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
um over to the Genesis of of the
 
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
um and sort of how we got here today
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
because there's some points in the
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
original bill that I think are worthy of
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
discussion relative to some comments
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
that Mr Farrell made a few minutes ago
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
if we go back to the original bill it
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
was to allow the Department of Education
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
to file complaints on behalf of parents
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
to file with the Human Rights Commission
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
for alleged violations of RSA 193
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
um 38 39 and 40. RSA 193 40 paragraph
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
four violation of this section by an
 
00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
educator shall be considered a violation
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
of the educator code of conduct that
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
justifies disciplinary sanction by the
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education so a violation
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
of this whatever we want to call this
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill the anti-discrimination bill or the
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
anti-anti-discrimination bill whatever
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
name we're gonna we're gonna give we're
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
going to give it
 
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:30.530 align:start position:0%
going to give it
um

00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
they included um that a violation of
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
that was was a violation of that statute
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
was a violation of the code of conduct
 
00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Farrell just said that there have
 
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
been no credible violations that have
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
crossed his desk relative to RSA 193 38
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
39 and 40.
 
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
I surmised that that is why the bill was
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
put in in the first place
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
so the department could file these
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
coax the language out the way the
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
department wanted to
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
alleged way it would want to and then
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
there'd be an alleged violation of the
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
statute not filed by the parent the
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
filed by the by the department in an
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
effort to then pursue cases of educator
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
misconduct both under the statute and
 
00:59:22.609 --> 00:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
then under the teacher code of conduct
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's very very interesting that none of
 
00:59:28.569 --> 00:59:28.579 align:start position:0%
these allegations under the
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
anti-anti-discrimination statute have
 
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
come forward to the Human Rights
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
Commission or have crossed Mr Farrell's
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
desk but yet we had a bill last year
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
saying that somehow this was needed
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
somehow this was needed somehow this was
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
needed let me just interrupt you for one
 
00:59:42.359 --> 00:59:43.370 align:start position:0%
needed let me just interrupt you for one
moment

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr Farrell talked about hb2 you
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
are talking about the same correct oh
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
language it's just that when it was
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
incorporated into rsas
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
um it was under those three sections
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
that you just alluded to correct thank
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
you very much Madam chair yes um these
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
provisions of Statute and RSA 193 that I
 
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
referred to were included in House Bill
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
2 in 2019 for a variety of reasons
 
01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
um so with that background I find it
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
interesting it's just very interesting
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
that Mr Farrell was saying that none of
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
the allegations under this
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
anti-anti-discrimination statute have
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
either one Cross disaster two have not
 
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
risen to a level of a violation of the
 
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
code of conduct which is a very peculiar
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
that we had a bill
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
seeking to give the department authority
 
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:35.220 align:start position:0%
to be the one to file and write these
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
complaints it's very very peculiar the
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
other aspect that I think is is is is is
 
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
important for the for the committee to
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
for for the community to be mindful of
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
when Mr Farrell testified
 
01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
um on the proposed amendment February
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
March whenever that was
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
um he said that parents are weaponizing
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct
 
01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct
um

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know what that means
 
01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
specifically I don't know if that means
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
that they're filing false allegations
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education or the
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
allegations that they are filing are not
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
um credible or if they simply don't rise
 
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
to the level of a violation under the
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
code of conduct but I went back and
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
watched that testimony to make sure I
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
had his language right Mr Farrell said
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
that parents are weaponizing the code of
 
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.970 align:start position:0%
that parents are weaponizing the code of
conduct

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
um so that should be a very very
 
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.390 align:start position:0%
um so that should be a very very
important

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
um consideration for whatever this
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
committee you know does it whatever
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
comes out at the end of this committee
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
or whatever legislation may be filed
 
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
um next fall the last aspect well maybe
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
not the last but one other aspect that
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage the committee to do
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
if you have not already take a look at
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education role Ed 511 511
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
that's the Department of Education rule
 
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
that sort of lays out the process for
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
complaints cases and investigations
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
um and it's about it's not too along to
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
about maybe four or five pages again
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
that's Ed 5 11.
 
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and just I'll read it if I you
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
indulge me just for a second or two the
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
opening paragraph says a case shall be
 
01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:11.220 align:start position:0%
opened when a complaint of possible
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
misconduct against a credentialed holder
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
has come to the attention of the
 
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
department either through direct
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
reporting or other means
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
the next paragraph after an initial
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
review if the department determines that
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
a possible violation of the code of
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
conduct has occurred and investigations
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
shall be open so I can't speak to that I
 
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
presume Mr Farrell can at some point but
 
01:02:35.450 --> 01:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
a parent calls in or a superintendent
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
calls in to to make a statement to Mr
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
Farrell or attorney Fenton a case is
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
opened and then they do some preliminary
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
investigation and then if they believe
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
you know it's warranted an investigation
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
is open so there's a case in
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
investigation relative to that nhsba's
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
position would be that
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
um if if the department is going to be
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
granted subpoena power
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
um there needs to be sort of a
 
01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
triggering effect to that we talked
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
about due to the you know you can go
 
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
broad brushed or you can go very narrow
 
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's probably something in between I
 
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
don't want to say what that would be
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
without really giving a consideration
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
looking at language looking at other
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
states things of that nature
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
um but if if the department is going to
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
be given um subpoena power there should
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
be one a triggering event and two there
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
should be parameters and criteria most
 
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
specifically and I've talked about this
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit when um when we had the the
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
hearing on the amendment
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
um if there's going to be subpoena power
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
issued there needs to be guard rails and
 
01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:41.660 align:start position:0%
safeguards for for parents and students
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
we spent we meeting this legislative
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
body both both houses spent a lot of
 
01:03:49.849 --> 01:03:49.859 align:start position:0%
time this session talking about parental
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
rights if a student is going to her
 
01:03:55.309 --> 01:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
child is going to be subpoenaed
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
um it would make sense to me that the
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
parent should be notified and the
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
parents should be given some option as
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
to whether or not to quash The subpoena
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
that usually involves hiring an attorney
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
and an additional cost or there should
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
be some sort of opt-out we hear about
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
parents being able to opt out of all
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
sorts of things in the educational realm
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
these days testing curriculum whatever
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
it might be so it seems to me that there
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
should be at least some some
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
notification to parents some explanation
 
01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:25.859 align:start position:0%
to parents of a document drawn up either
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education or the
 
01:04:30.530 --> 01:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office outlining what
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
the parental rights are in case the
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
student gets subpoenaed or in case
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
Student Records get subpoenaed and then
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
give parents some sort of options within
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
that that would be consistent with a lot
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
of the tone of a lot of bills this year
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the legislature
 
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I think those are the only comments I
 
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
have right now again there's a lot to
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
unpack here uh the school boards
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
Association will certainly be attending
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know the further committee meetings
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not over the summer or over
 
01:04:58.609 --> 01:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
um we're also here um we're happy to
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
offer um our assistance to the committee
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
um uh you know whatever resources that
 
01:05:08.329 --> 01:05:08.339 align:start position:0%
we could help with we're happy to do
 
01:05:08.339 --> 01:05:09.530 align:start position:0%
we could help with we're happy to do
that

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I know um you know Jen is often
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed and overloaded despite the
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
amazing work that she does um you know I
 
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
know it's only one person
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
um but you know we obviously have the
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
school board just New Hampshire school
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
boards Association has
 
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
um you know contacts with 49 other state
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
school boards associations and we can
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
tap into those as to what their
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
departments are doing what their laws
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
are saying
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
um how the investigative power I'm sorry
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
how The subpoena Powers with their
 
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
department and uh lie and and so on and
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
so forth so if there's anything that the
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
committee needs assistance with by all
 
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
means please reach out to myself or or
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
Becky Wilson our director governmental
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
relations as well too and we're happy to
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
help the community in whatever way we
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
can so I think that's it um for me today
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
my comments today and I'm happy to
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that the that the
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee may have
 
01:05:58.490 --> 01:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
questions representative Paige thanks
 
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you um do you know if the
 
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can currently
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
ask the Attorney General's office for a
 
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
subpoena if they needed one for some
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't know
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
the answer to that
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
and if follow-up if I may have if if
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
they could would that be a
 
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
a guardrail
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
that would certainly be one guard rail
 
01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.670 align:start position:0%
that would certainly be one guard rail
absolutely

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
um you know sort of the same way that um
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
I believe I believe the Attorney
 
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:28.700 align:start position:0%
General's office is investigating
 
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
complaints that come in under the
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
anti-anti-discrimination law if that
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
complaint initially comes to the
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Education it's my
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
understanding that the Attorney
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
General's office is reviewing them first
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
to see if they have Merit before they're
 
01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:41.339 align:start position:0%
passed on to the Human Rights Commission
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
so there's only some interplay relative
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
to maybe not directly related to
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
subpoena power but certainly within the
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
realm of what we've been talking about
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the original bill in the
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
 
01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:54.770 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you
representative

01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
so just so I'm understanding correctly
 
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
you for letting me ask
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
what I heard you say I just want to make
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
sure I'm understanding correctly that
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
generally speaking that you're you
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
support the bill as long as there's
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
safeguards and parameters in place to
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know there's some
 
01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
protection going on with it is that is
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
that a fair yeah I don't want to put
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
words in your mouth thank you very much
 
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
um for the for the question
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative I mean you know the
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
lawyer in me I'm a member of the bar I'm
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
going to say well I want to see the bill
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
first but those sorts of guard rails and
 
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
safeguards notice the parents protecting
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
the parents rights giving them Options
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
under whether it's a memorandum from the
 
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
Department that would go a long way in
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
in helping nhsba support the bill
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
because you made yourself vulnerable by
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
saying you were a lawyer first
 
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.150 align:start position:0%
saying you were a lawyer first
um

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
what we heard earlier is that
 
01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
um the superintendent might have an
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
individual superintendent and again
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
we're speaking about very very few
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
people I keep on wanting I make that
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
same point but I think it's important to
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
make again and again that the
 
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
superintendent might have been
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
um willing and previously might have
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
cooperated but
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
um as soon as the temperature rises so
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
to speak an attorney is hired and then
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
it would appear that the attorney
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
takes over and tells the superintendent
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
no you may not share this or that or
 
01:08:33.839 --> 01:08:34.669 align:start position:0%
no you may not share this or that or
whatever

01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
I was always under the impression that
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
the attorney worked for
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
the person who retained her services and
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
am I wrong about that thank you for the
 
01:08:49.570 --> 01:08:49.580 align:start position:0%
question representative to be clear
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
though I am and I'll get to your your
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
answer in a second representative
 
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
um to be clear
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
um though I am an attorney and we have a
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
staff attorney on staff at nhsb we don't
 
01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
provide direct legal services to school
 
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
districts we provide training General
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
Legal Information is there a statute
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
that says this and you point them in the
 
01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
um uh so the dis the attorneys that Mr
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
Farrell referenced and presumably works
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
with they are representing the district
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
as a as a corporate entity and then
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
obviously the school board and the
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
superintendent have fiduciary duties and
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to the district as a
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
whole I mean one of those is obviously
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
protecting kids but it's also
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
maintaining Fidelity and adherence to
 
01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
other laws such as student privacy laws
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
student confidentiality laws staff
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
confidentiality laws so on and so forth
 
01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
so but the attorney itself the attorney
 
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
as you as you ask Madam chair is
 
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
representing the district as an entity
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
and is not representing the teacher per
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
se or not representing the
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
superintendent per se at least in the
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
context of the phone calls that Mr
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
Farrell or attorney Fenton would make
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
saying may I have these documents may
 
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
have these documents
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm interested to hear what you say
 
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.550 align:start position:0%
I'm interested to hear what you say
um

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
because I know for example we have a
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
great deal of evidence that in special
 
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
education matters there are very few law
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
firms that specialize on in in
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
representing uh school school districts
 
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
representing uh school school districts
but

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
they do a very good job in that
 
01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
representation and they also get paid
 
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:38.090 align:start position:0%
representation and they also get paid
um

01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
by the hour so that it is in the
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
attorney's personal interest to what I
 
01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.250 align:start position:0%
attorney's personal interest to what I
would

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps intolerantly refer to as churn
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
to say to the principal the school
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
superintendent whatever oh we're not
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the legitimate need of
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
special education here because why
 
01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:06.140 align:start position:0%
should we pay for it let's just keep on
 
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
challenging it ending up probably
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
spending more money on legal fees than
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
they would have paid for the special
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
education and we know that that happens
 
01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:19.820 align:start position:0%
and it happens again and again so
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
when I listen to to the testimony that
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
it is the lawyers who say don't
 
01:11:33.649 --> 01:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
cooperate or we won't share the document
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can't take the document out it's not
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the best interest of the
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
child it is probably in the best
 
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
interest of the attorney
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question statement
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
well it really was a preparation I would
 
01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:49.460 align:start position:0%
guess if I um
 
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
a bad lawyer can make a case drag on for
 
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
years a good lawyer can make a case drag
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
on even longer
 
01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
oh my goodness gracious I mean I I don't
 
01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
respectfully representative you know
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're about 40 attorneys in
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
the state that
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
um that work with school districts some
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
of them it's 100 of their caseload
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
others it may be 10 or 15 percent of the
 
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.810 align:start position:0%
others it may be 10 or 15 percent of the
caseload

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
um but we're not going to name names no
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
no no but but well they do other things
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know they may have you know they may
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
represent a district in a in a right to
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
no law case but they may do some
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant stuff for drafting wills
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
and you know trust that you know as well
 
01:12:36.890 --> 01:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
you know I don't you know I
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
plenty of jokes can be made about
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys doing it for the money you
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
said they bill by the hour they they
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
bill every six or ten minutes depending
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
on what the depending on what their
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
firm's practice is so I mean are the
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys doing it to rack up their
 
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
bills I certainly hope not
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
I guess my my question was that
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
are we do we have a problem here with
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
the school administration
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
or do we have a problem with legal
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
representation of the school
 
01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
administration because that's a
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
different matter sure and I think
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
but again respectfully representative I
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
don't you asked do we have a problem
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
with the administration or a problem
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
with the attorneys I don't think there's
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
a problem with either of them I think
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
the I think the superintendents are
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
doing what they can do in the best
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
interest of of students and keeping
 
01:13:27.050 --> 01:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
students safe and the attorneys are
 
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
doing the best that they can do to
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
advise the school district in their in
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
the superintendent on how to proceed
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
under a myriad of very complex laws
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
whether it's special education student
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
privacy you know FERPA Student Records
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a there's a myriad of
 
01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:43.990 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a there's a myriad of
very

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
complex issues at play when when student
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
records and staff records that are
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise exempt from disclosure under
 
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
both state and federal law are being
 
01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:56.219 align:start position:0%
asked to turn over to somebody you know
 
01:13:56.219 --> 01:13:58.010 align:start position:0%
asked to turn over to somebody you know
who's

01:13:58.010 --> 01:13:58.020 align:start position:0%
who's
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
you know to an agency who's
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
motives may be in question
 
01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:07.580 align:start position:0%
thank you any anything else yes
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative I won't having made a
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
living on those six minute increments I
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
won't I won't take offense to the chairs
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
questioning but but uh
 
01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
um here is a question
 
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
um even that going back to that
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
um sort of in-camera review of this
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
document that might exist about yeah
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
whatever it is and I recognize that the
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
school district may be the school board
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
or whatever may be the the client at the
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
end of the day you know it's
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
it's not the superintendent versus so
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
and so it's you know
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
Exeter School essays right the district
 
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
is either the plaintiff or the defendant
 
01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
right so so but in that moment when the
 
01:14:46.490 --> 01:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
superintendents sort of been charged
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
with their responsibilities and they're
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be fair to say that the
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
superintendent would have that or
 
01:14:59.689 --> 01:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
discretion in terms of
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
um that document release if he's
 
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
listening to his legal counsel I know
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
that some may be more cautious and may
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
say well I'm gonna run this through
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
executive session or what have you but
 
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if that that would be a
 
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
possibility wouldn't it certainly thank
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative I
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
mean part of it would have to be what is
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
being asked to be produced you know it
 
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
it take take take out the The subpoena
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
power aspects just for a second and the
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
code of conduct just for a second
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know you get a voluminous right to
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
know law request under 91a a
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent can look at it and say
 
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
you know yeah these five things we know
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
are public records I can disclose those
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
right now these five things that are
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
being asked for I need to run it by
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
Council because I really have no idea
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
and and and the exemption statute RSA
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
9185 documents that are exempt from
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
disclosure that's a mess that statute is
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
a mess it's complex it's convoluted it's
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
vague you know representative we've had
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
numerous numerous right to know law
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
bills the last 10 years in this in this
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
room and there's always trying to tweak
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
it so you know does a superintendent
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
have some discretion with that but you
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
know as I said we're soft in the first
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
line we don't give direct legal advice
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
if a superintendent called me and said
 
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
we got a subpoena from the Department
 
01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
asking for these 10 things I'd say you
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
need to call Private Council I said
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
don't try and figure that out for
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
yourself why why take a risk making a
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
mistake and disclosing something that
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
should not be disclosed and contains
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
private confidential information that's
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
sort of the other thing too I didn't
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
mention this but you got me going on it
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative I'm speaking to the guard
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
rails as we as we talked about I know
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
there are some Provisions in FERPA the
 
01:16:44.689 --> 01:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
federal education rights Privacy Act
 
01:16:46.729 --> 01:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
that relates to Student Records and he
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
can't be disclosed without you know
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
parental consent there's there is a
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
subpoena exception in there but there
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
should we should also put some guard
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
rails in whatever statue comes out of
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:16:58.370 --> 01:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
what is the department going to do with
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
those records once they have them and
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
how long are they going to retain them
 
01:17:04.729 --> 01:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
for are they destroyed are they what are
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
they kept in a file if there's an
 
01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
investigation I don't I don't know that
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
there may be a law enforcement aspect of
 
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
that that I'm simply not aware of but
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
another another aspect for the
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I hope I answered your question
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your time it was very
 
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
helpful if you do want to
 
01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:32.990 align:start position:0%
helpful if you do want to
um

01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
put in writing your initial statement
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
um and send it to us we would appreciate
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
that it would
 
01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.669 align:start position:0%
that it would
um

01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
we need to add to our body of knowledge
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
and we recognize that with that's what
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
we're committed to we don't know we
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a final determination we
 
01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
and if this were easy we wouldn't be
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
sitting here right we know it's very
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
complicated and
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
um any information that helps inform us
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
um would be welcome and so I appreciate
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
your willingness is there anyone else
 
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you is there
 
01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
anyone else Madam chair could I just
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
make one layer one thing on to that
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
comment that you were just
 
01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the information that
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
you might find you you run in the
 
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
circles of school boards and
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
superintendents and so on and perhaps
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
there's a way for you to um distill to
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
what extent if any
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
um you know this this resistance if you
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
will that seems to be new
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
either a exists and why
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
um you know so I'm not asking you to
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
answer that now or you may say I'm not
 
01:18:47.209 --> 01:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
going to answer it but that's fine but
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
just in terms of your calling
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
information sure just to make sure I'm
 
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
clear on the question so as to why
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
things are different today than they
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
were perhaps 10 years ago was that the
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
question I must have missed what you're
 
01:18:59.810 --> 01:18:59.820 align:start position:0%
actually yeah so so part of the
 
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
conversation I think we're having today
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
was um this idea that um
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason superintendents or
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
school districts are reluctant to give
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
any information that might be helpful to
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
the doe in that investigation you know
 
01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:15.659 align:start position:0%
of alleged an activity bad activity so
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
something's changed because that seems
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
to be new and and and it seems from the
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
timeline so you know is that occurring
 
01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
at what extent you know and then uh if
 
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
so what explains it if we don't right I
 
01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
I prefer to give that some more thought
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
if that's okay oh yeah yeah I don't want
 
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
you to answer it now I mean like a
 
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
deliberative thought on it right thank
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you madam chair
 
01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else here who would like to add
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
to our knowledge
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
or subtract from our knowledge I mean
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's also possible
 
01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:52.310 align:start position:0%
that's also possible
um

01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to make sure
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
anyone who wanted to be heard was heard
 
01:19:56.699 --> 01:19:59.030 align:start position:0%
anyone who wanted to be heard was heard
um

01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
the question is are we
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
better situated now than we were an hour
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
and a half ago in terms of
 
01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:13.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.689 --> 01:20:16.699 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:20.699 align:start position:0%
pursue possible Avenues of resolving the
 
01:20:20.699 --> 01:20:21.590 align:start position:0%
pursue possible Avenues of resolving the
problem

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
I guess the answer is probably yes and
 
01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.250 align:start position:0%
I guess the answer is probably yes and
no

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:27.290 align:start position:0%
no
um

01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
we as a as a subcommittee will not be
 
01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
doing anything
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
over this summer
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
um but we will be coming back in
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
September and would it would be helpful
 
01:20:42.850 --> 01:20:42.860 align:start position:0%
if we were
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
able to move ourselves further along in
 
01:20:49.570 --> 01:20:49.580 align:start position:0%
terms of of what we might want to pursue
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
the vice chair has been helpful I think
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
in giving us some information about how
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
you one might Define the reasons for uh
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
a subpoena and the alternative is
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
um are there reasons
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
for this commissioner to have
 
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education to have
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
um subpoena power I believe it is very
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
important that as we do this
 
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
work we recognize that our concern is
 
01:21:32.209 --> 01:21:32.219 align:start position:0%
institutional it is not
 
01:21:32.219 --> 01:21:33.530 align:start position:0%
institutional it is not
personal

01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore whoever is Con whoever or
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
whomever whomever is
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
um commissioner today may may not be
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner a year from now and we have
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that what we have in place
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
is something that respects the
 
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
institution first
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the powers that we give to the
 
01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.910 align:start position:0%
and the powers that we give to the
institution

01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
institution
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
can then be applied by
 
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
anyone who's occupying the appropriate
 
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
positions of power and and it's
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that nothing we do
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
could be construed in any other way
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
but recognizing commitment to the
 
01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:19.810 align:start position:0%
but recognizing commitment to the
institution

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:19.820 align:start position:0%
institution
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
and also acknowledging changes in the
 
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.110 align:start position:0%
and also acknowledging changes in the
world

01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:26.090 align:start position:0%
world
um

01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
so I'm I didn't expect to be able to say
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
at the end of this okay I see clearly
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
where we should where we should go let's
 
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
just do this and didn't expect that but
 
01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
Ron plus I guess about
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
being able to say to the committee okay
 
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
you do this and you do that because I
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
don't see it um
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
and perhaps other people do but I would
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
hope that you would
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
use this as a as a helpful opportunity
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
to see how complicated it is
 
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:05.780 align:start position:0%
and then we can come back maybe
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
reinvigorate and ready to figure out
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
where we want to go does that make sense
 
01:23:11.209 --> 01:23:11.219 align:start position:0%
to people
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything they want to
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
say yes
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
I I heard that we needed you know it was
 
01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to put in some
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place but I guess I'd like
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
to understand you know after hearing
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
what we've heard does everybody feel
 
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
like this is a path that we should you
 
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
know look into you know going further
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
with this bill or is there still
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
hesitation with the bill I'd just like
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
to understand kind of where everybody is
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
at is that a fair question
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
oh any questions fair and there's no
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
obligation for anybody to answer it so
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
no correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
but I believe that the intent of the
 
01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
current bill
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
was just to give the
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.550 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
the

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.810 align:start position:0%
 
capability

01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
capability
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
to submit a
 
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.250 align:start position:0%
to submit a
complaint

01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
no no you're you have the original Bill
 
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
we had a non-germaine Amendment which
 
01:24:18.010 --> 01:24:18.020 align:start position:0%
completely changed this around what the
 
01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Bell did was it gave
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
subpoena power to the depart to the
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the education
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner to subpoena documents
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
persons and other things related to
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
violations with the code of conduct
 
01:24:35.689 --> 01:24:35.699 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can pull up like exactly
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
it was very short so it said
 
01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:39.950 align:start position:0%
it was very short so it said
um

01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
I have it okay perfect but uh
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
was this adopted by the committee it
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't but that was kind of the
 
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
direction of why we retained the bill I
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
think we had decided that the initial
 
01:24:52.610 --> 01:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
bill was completely not needed but that
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
there was need for the this non-germaine
 
01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:56.930 align:start position:0%
there was need for the this non-germaine
amendment

01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:24:56.940 --> 01:24:58.189 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
you know to have the authority to issue
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
subpoenas for Relevant documents and
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
items for the
 
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
code of conduct so it has nothing to do
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:25:12.110 --> 01:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission no
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
I learned something today
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
everybody should learn something new
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes I learned so many new things
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
that there's no room in my brain
 
01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:26.450 align:start position:0%
that there's no room in my brain
so

01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
all right well that
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
changes my focus thank you okay anybody
 
01:25:31.679 --> 01:25:33.770 align:start position:0%
changes my focus thank you okay anybody
else

01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
I guess to the dude yeah
 
01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:39.290 align:start position:0%
I guess to the dude yeah
um

01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:42.110 --> 01:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
to represent Top's question I think is
 
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.790 align:start position:0%
to represent Top's question I think is
um

01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
I guess I I'm still in the position of
 
01:25:51.169 --> 01:25:51.179 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard for me to to
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative trips up
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
point it's hard for me to escape the
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
history of this
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
um in the sense that it's where where
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
the original bill is and then and then
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
what the um
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
amendment is in terms of subpoena power
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
and and not be a little a little bit
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
hesitant or cautious
 
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.410 align:start position:0%
hesitant or cautious
um

01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
about about proceeding have having said
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
that and setting setting that aside to
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative chairperson Smith
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
point about separating the personal and
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
the institutional I I think we should
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
take take that to heart although it
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be a bit difficult in this
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
particular context
 
01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.709 align:start position:0%
particular context
um but

01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
and setting that aside
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I still feel like I need more
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
information about what if any
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
other states are doing what what sort of
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
what what it would exist like what you
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
know not and in terms of the reasons for
 
01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:45.229 align:start position:0%
know not and in terms of the reasons for
it

01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
um which
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm not
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony from the from reps
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
or from investigator Farrell
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
but but I also
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
it seems seems to be conflicting at some
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
points in my view about the success he
 
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
was having
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm still a little bit
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
uh fuzzy about the need and I think the
 
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
one thing that we come to Concord to do
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
is not past things that that we don't
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
need but um
 
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
so so that's where I'm at but having
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
said that I would certainly um if I
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
thank the website for outlining some
 
01:27:22.129 --> 01:27:22.139 align:start position:0%
starting the thought process I guess if
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
you will about that sort of thing
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I just want to ask so I
 
01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:29.030 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I just want to ask so I
guess

01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
where this was completely non-germaine
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
is there an ability for us to just
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
kill the other Bill and just start from
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
the beginning with a bill that actually
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
relates to what we actually need because
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
I I do
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
um relate to what you're saying in terms
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
of the path well every I think it's
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
confusing for everybody why we started
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
out with something that's completely
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
unrelated to this and now we're down a
 
01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
completely new Amendment with it it
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
almost just seems like we're about to
 
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
start you know in September with putting
 
01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:01.139 align:start position:0%
in new lslr lsrs does it make sense to
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
just start fresh with something you know
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
that would have like all these
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
parameters and then actually having
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
testimony on the actual parameters and
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
everything because
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's for me it's hard to know
 
01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
like are there going to be some
 
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences without having
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know a full hearing to kind of vet
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
the legislation of how we would put
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
something in I don't know I what I I'm a
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
freshman so I'm not sure if that's
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
something that's even doable I'd love to
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
hear is well I think the point that you
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
make is is quite valid and we've seen
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
here on the committee the confusion that
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
we have about the underlying bill and
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
the non-germaine amendment
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
um that you know to begin with creates a
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
very complicated issue for us
 
01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
um there is perfectly appropriate and
 
01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that could stop anyone
 
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
from in the second week of September
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
filing an um
 
01:29:07.129 --> 01:29:07.139 align:start position:0%
uh a request for a bill
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
to give the commissioner of Education
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
subpoena power in certain
 
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:14.689 align:start position:0%
subpoena power in certain
um

01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:14.699 --> 01:29:16.669 align:start position:0%
um
areas

01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
um and so could do that the Commit This
 
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
committee can
 
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:24.709 align:start position:0%
committee can
um

01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
adopt the underlying bill which I don't
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
think anyone thinks there's any need for
 
01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:33.260 align:start position:0%
could adopt the non-germaine amendment
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
where there seems to be some difference
 
01:29:38.689 --> 01:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
of opinion or
 
01:29:38.699 --> 01:29:39.590 align:start position:0%
of opinion or
um

01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.970 align:start position:0%
um
could

01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.229 align:start position:0%
could
um

01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
could itl the entire kitten caboodle or
 
01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:48.229 align:start position:0%
could itl the entire kitten caboodle or
um

01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:51.860 align:start position:0%
amend come in with an amendment
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
to the underlying Bill if we thought we
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to use that
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle for something so all of
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
those options are open to us they're
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
different time
 
01:30:07.129 --> 01:30:07.139 align:start position:0%
restrictions I mean you know to submit a
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
new completely new bill that's September
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
11th to 15th I think
 
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
to have a this committee report on a
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
retained bill is the 15th or the 17th of
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
November I keep on looking over it at my
 
01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:26.090 align:start position:0%
November I keep on looking over it at my
Guru

01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
Guru
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
um but I believe that that's that's true
 
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
and all of that is possible and it
 
01:30:33.649 --> 01:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
occurs to me that we might have a better
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
sense after the summer of what makes
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
what in fact makes more sense I don't
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
think I don't think right now there's
 
01:30:43.970 --> 01:30:43.980 align:start position:0%
any unanimity
 
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
in this group and of course we then have
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
to go to the full committee and if we're
 
01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:51.350 align:start position:0%
to go to the full committee and if we're
not

01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
um comfortable together we certainly
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
know that the full committee is not
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
going to be comfortable together
 
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
um so uh my one remaining question is
 
01:31:08.689 --> 01:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable with a reasonable amount
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
of time on your part which means about
 
01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
35 seconds since you have so many other
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
things on your plate
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
to get either from ncsl or from another
 
01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.910 align:start position:0%
to get either from ncsl or from another
source

01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.470 align:start position:0%
source
um

01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
information as to
 
01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.729 align:start position:0%
information as to
um

01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
subpoena power under these circumstances
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
in within the you know public education
 
01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
in within the you know public education
system

01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:31:42.169 --> 01:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
having said that I realized that none of
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
it might be relevant because in so many
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
ways what we do in public education in
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
this state differs from what happens in
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
other states including Authority
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
ultimate Authority so it might be that
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
there's no parallel experiences and I
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
understand that but
 
01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
that would be terrific and if you do
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
find something could I ask that you send
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
it on to us rather than waiting till
 
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
September but send it on to us when you
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
get it because that will help us in our
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
idle moments of trying to to sort this
 
01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:34.189 align:start position:0%
idle moments of trying to to sort this
through

01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
good beach reading exactly I'd like to
 
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
question you about good speech reading
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
and bad Beach reading but okay anything
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
else that anyone wants to share if not I
 
01:32:49.129 --> 01:32:49.139 align:start position:0%
expect that I will see everybody sitting
 
01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
at this side of the table on Thursday
 
01:32:56.689 --> 01:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
some of us we might see tomorrow at the
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
other subcommittee meetings
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
um but do show up on Thursday
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
um anything else
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
if not
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:39.970 align:start position:0%
 
goodbye

01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:39.980 align:start position:0%
