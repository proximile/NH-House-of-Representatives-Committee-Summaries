major and members of the committee um
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
represent major had asked me to set up
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
your Revenue estimating work sheets and
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
to schedule today and tomorrow to be a
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
time when you can go over the worksheets
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
and have agencies available to answer
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have as you're
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
looking at these revenues and and
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
thinking about how you want to do your
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
estimates so he wanted me to start with
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
um just showing you what the documents
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
are and kind of how they're set up um if
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
you I sent an email on Friday to
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
everybody with all the documents um you
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
should have received three PDFs one was
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
an agenda one was a PDF of the worksheet
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
and one was a PDF of um the highway fund
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
estimates and then an Excel worksheet
 
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:38.919 align:start position:0%
that is the um estimating worksheet that
 
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
you can play in and and add and subtract
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
numbers and make adjustments as you
 
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
would like to do so what I'm going to do
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
is share my screen and just kind of walk
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
you through the estimating worksheet
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
just so you can understand what I did
 
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:58.430 align:start position:0%
just so you can understand what I did
there

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
so are you seeing uh D the tab Dr high
 
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.269 align:start position:0%
so are you seeing uh D the tab Dr high
low

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
estimate yes okay it's a little
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
small all right let's see if I can it's
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
a full size on my screen so I don't know
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
what I can do and while he's doing that
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
I encourage members of the committee to
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
uh don't hesitate to ask
 
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
questions interrupt them that's this is
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
a learning process for you and for all
 
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.910 align:start position:0%
a learning process for you and for all
of

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
us

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
okay chis if you zoom in yeah
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm now is that much
 
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.990 align:start position:0%
I'm now is that much
larger

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
larger
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes all right so to start with what I
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
did is I took um Dr came to you last uh
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
last week and presented um what they
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
what their potential estimates are for
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
the different Revenue sources that you
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
would be looking at um collected by
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
their agency which is typically the
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
business taxes meals and rooms tobacco
 
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
tax um interest in dividends
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax utility tax
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
the um and the real estate transfer tax
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of the interesting things you have
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
going on this year with your revenues on
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
a cash basis is that $30 million of
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue that shows up on a cash basis
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
going to be backed out at the end of the
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
year because it was money that was due
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
in F fiscal year 20 not 21 so on this
 
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
page here and I'll just go to row four
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
or row nine which is four here um you'll
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
see that for 21 you have a low of
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
$799 do8 for the business taxes that
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
removes the $18.3 million that was the
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
um cash that's going to be back going
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal year 20 and so that's how
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
I grew based on the percentages provided
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
by Dr the revenues for 22 and
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
23 so this is just a one page for you to
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
look at with all these um uh the Dr
 
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources and you can see what
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
percentage it was growing by so the the
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
low number
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
7998 in fiscal year 22 was growing by 1%
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
so 111% of your previous year and then
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
the high for fiscal 22 was growing by 3%
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
over the high of um fiscal year 21 and
 
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
that same pattern is followed throughout
 
00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
this table here okay let me stop there
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
yep when the Dr comes in and they
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.190 align:start position:0%
 
799.99

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
799.99
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
point8 and what makes up that
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
number why isn't it lower or or higher
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
ask those questions
 
00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
24.2 why did you pick this and what's
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
the reason behind
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
it but but I just ask Chris on you said
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
that you took on the anomalies out of on
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
799 ripson Vol you went mute
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
did you take them out of column d as
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
well yes yeah
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's the right thing to do
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
because uh those anomalies were there in
 
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.710 align:start position:0%
because uh those anomalies were there in
your

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
projected growth or decline in coming
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
years you'd have the wrong base to start
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
with so now I have a question you just
 
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
referred to those as anomalies I thought
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
they were just payments that were
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
received because of that July 15th
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
federal tax date that people got
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
confused with so is it an anomaly or
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
just in the wrong
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
year it's in the wrong year it's in the
 
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.470 align:start position:0%
year it's in the wrong year it's in the
wrong

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
year but the Dr has been calling them
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
anomalies and and I think that that's
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
the um nomenclature that's been used
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
since they've identified that um so it's
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
not just ER using that now so it's a
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
it's an anomalous receivable that was do
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 20 they ended up in fiscal 21
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
and then I think uh commissioner stpp
 
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
had explained to you that there's that
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
60-day window after the close of the
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year where there's a adjustments
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
made to your revenues and and that's
 
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
when they determin that that Revenue
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
should have been or would have been
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
collected in fiscal year 20 if the
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
federal government hadn't extended the
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
um filing date to July 15th for your
 
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.629 align:start position:0%
um filing date to July 15th for your
federal

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
taxes so barring any changes like that
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
you would have collected that Revenue in
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 and not seen it in 21 so
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is smooth out
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
the estimates for you here so you don't
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
um overestimate what potentially what
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
you might be seeing in future
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
years I don't know if that helps or
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
hurts but you that's the explanation CH
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
is that 18 just a part of the 30 million
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
anomalous that was attributable to July
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
and August yeah yeah so if if you look
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
at um the Dr
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
presentation um from last week on page
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
56 I believe of their
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
presentation there's a table that shows
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the various um amounts attributable
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
for that anomalous revenue for each of
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
the B uh Revenue sources
 
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and then that's a taken out for
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
each one of those go to page 57 of that
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
same pres their same presentation you'll
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
see where they um they've already
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
accounted for those anomalies or that
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
receivable Revenue by removing it and
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
these numbers should all tie to that
 
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
these numbers should all tie to that
thank

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
you if they don't let me
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
know oh just I also resent the documents
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
this morning just before this meeting to
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
you um in case people didn't see it on
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
Friday when I sent them so it's and I'm
 
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
using the um house Ways and Means group
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
email to send the documents they're also
 
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
available on our website um in the PDFs
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
I didn't put the Excel
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
up so that's so that's how you get the
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh the taxes are the revenues that Dr is
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking to that's how I
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
come up with those numbers and then I
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
bring them into the next tab which is
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
the GF ETF which is general fund
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
worksheet and you see here the business
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
taxes um for the 21 you should see the
 
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
agency low and high should tie to the
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
number that's in the table on the
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
previous tab and the same with 22 and
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
23 on the worksheet we also provide you
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2020 we give you the
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
official plan so what was anticipated at
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
the time you the revenue estimates were
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
done and then what the caffer um showed
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
for actual Revenue coming in
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that the official plan is
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
on a cash basis the cafer is on a a
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
modified acral basis so they're slightly
 
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759 align:start position:0%
different but the caffer number it
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
becomes your official Revenue number you
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
know that's the number everybody will
 
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
speak to that the state collected X
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
dollars but everything you do on row
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
nine and um below are typically on a
 
00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:32.550 align:start position:0%
nine and um below are typically on a
cash

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
cash
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
basis for other agencies that provided
 
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
you estimates such as liquor um
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
commission I took their number so for
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
2021 they had a an estimate of 129
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
million and because they didn't provide
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
a range I just put that both as the high
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
low and so you will see that with most
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
agencies outside of Dr did not provide a
 
00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.790 align:start position:0%
agencies outside of Dr did not provide a
range

00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
um so you'll just see the same number in
 
00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
the in the low and and high
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
estimate and then that goes through each
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
of your unrestricted general fund
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
education trust fund revenues on row
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
four of the worksheet you're going to
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
see gen gen and ETF or just gen or ETF
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
and that just tells you that um that
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source either goes totally to
 
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
the general fund totally to the
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or a split in some
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
manner between the two
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
funds but as you do your estimate you
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
typically will do them as a as a total
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
and then after um I will try to do an
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
approximate split or an estimated split
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
between the education trust fund and the
 
00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.549 align:start position:0%
between the education trust fund and the
general

00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
fund so the just this same pattern
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
repeats for the
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
highway so there's a worksheet you've
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
got the fiscal year 20 then you got the
 
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
21 22 23 estimates if there's a range um
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
it shows and there is in the highway
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
fund and it's only in the motor vehicle
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
estimates and that's because there was a
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
different estimates provided by judicial
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
branch and the um Department of Safety
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
on what they thought would come in for
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
those Revenue related to what judicial
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
branch collects actually and there's a
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
one-page sheet that I had also provided
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
that kind of gives you a little bit more
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
detail so you can see some of the split
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
less detail than what safety provided
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
you in their page but more detail than
 
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
this page provides you and then the last
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
place you're going to do estimates is on
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
the um fishing game on restricted
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
revenue and again they they provided a
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
single estimate for each year so there's
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
no higher low and as I stated for each
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
of these um Revenue sources I've tried
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
to schedule on the agenda to have the
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
agencies available to you as you're
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
discussing them so this morning Dr is
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
Avail um as soon as I stop speaking um
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
so if there's any questions that you
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
have excuse me related to any of this
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
information here on this page where you
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
see the uh the ranges that I put based
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
on their
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
information um you know they're happy to
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
help you understand why they did what
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
they did but this is really a time for
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
you to you know I think to talk um with
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
each other and kind of understand you
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
know why the revenues are what they are
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
at 11:30 um Health and Human Services
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
will come into the call and they'll be
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
available to talk about recoveries if
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
there's any questions related to that
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
and then this afternoon at one o'clock
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
we have the highway fund um and I've got
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
the department of safety judicial branch
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
and Department of Transportation all I'm
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
going to be on the call at one o'clock
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
and then once you're done with Highway
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
fund discussion judicial branch will
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
discuss its um its
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
Revenue that you see um the court fines
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
and fees on this page here which is a
 
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.950 align:start position:0%
and fees on this page here which is a
column

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
column
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
I so that's all that's all I have at
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
this point um once you start making
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
estimates you know as the committee
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
starts to talk about and say you know we
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
believe in fiscal year 21 we should end
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
the year and the business taxes at 800
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
million and then in 22 it's going to be
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
820 million and in 23 it's going to be
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
850 million I'll populate the sale sales
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
for the highway uh house Ways and Means
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
estimates and um provide you a new
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
worksheet each time you work so that you
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
can see what you've discussed
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
again this is just a worksheet it's not
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
the official document that will um be
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
voted on uh by the the committee may
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
vote say y we agree to these estimates
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
and from there um typically what's
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
happened in the past is that put
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
together a house resolution with your
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates that you bring to the
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
full body um and then earlier in the in
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
the call I think R garlo was asking um
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know what do you do after you
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
basically do your initial estimates and
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
and rep some major indicated and as in
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
past years uh the committee has
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
typically come back in May and June to
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
revisit it it's Revenue estimates um
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
April and excuse me March and April are
 
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
two large months of Revenue particularly
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
with the business and IND taxes um
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
insurance comes in then so really those
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
are we consider those kind of make or
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
break months and then June is a is a
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
large estimating month
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
so that's all I really have at the
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
moment unless there's any questions for
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
me Chris can you go to page six and
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
R oh oh in the highway fund no no in the
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
fund the total
 
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.230 align:start position:0%
fund the total
yes

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
so so that's that is just your that's
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
the total all the revenue estimates that
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
you've made they're they're not split
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
out by in this in this worksheet I
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
haven't split them out by Highway excuse
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
me by education trust fund or general
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
fund this is just the total general fund
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue unrestricted Revenue that um
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
will then be used by finance committee
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
to to appropriate in places where you
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
see General funds are needed so on your
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
Excel worksheet yep in communication tax
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
of a million dollarss that will
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
automatically populate a change in
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
column R yes yep yeah so so the only the
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
only calculation that's occurring is in
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
column R that's going to Total
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
everything across from
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
um a through Q will be totaled across
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
the bottom and and you'll get a total
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
for your your um your estimates and
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
you're able to
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
see what is the estimate for FY 22 look
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
like for FY 21 and the actual for
 
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.590 align:start position:0%
like for FY 21 and the actual for
fy20

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
yep that'll tell you if the total
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
revenues are going down or going up or
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
much and with the Excel worksheet you'll
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
that major could I just add something
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
that some people don't understand we
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
have to put a single number into the
 
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
sheets uh for each year in the end
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
because we have to give a single number
 
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
for the total uh in the end to the
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
finance committee it goes into the
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
budget as a single number in the
 
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.789 align:start position:0%
budget as a single number in the
end

00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
Y and if I might rep up major the
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee is working on or focused on
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
unrestricted re
 
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
revenues these are the general fund um
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
education trust fund revenues go into
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and are used
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
for um adequacy payments or adequate
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
education payments as well as um this
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
last year they were used for
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
um um special ed and tuition and
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
transportation and building Aid that's
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
the first time this this last budget was
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
the first time that the education trust
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
fund was used for that in the past it's
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
been the general fund um and that
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
was decided during the last legislative
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
session but anyways so so you're there's
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
other revenues that go into the budget
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
that are already restricted or already
 
00:24:42.909 --> 00:24:42.919 align:start position:0%
have a purpose so your budget your
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
revenues are your Appropriations are
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
typically over a bium you know thir 13.2
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
billion dollar that was for this um last
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
b b we're in right now um so you had
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
revenues and federal dollars that were
 
00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
helping support that you don't
 
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.830 align:start position:0%
helping support that you don't
necessarily

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
estimate um so I just wanted to to
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
mention that because you know you may be
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about you know you're in
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment uh
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
environmental services and you're
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
thinking about wetlands and and the
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
programs there how are they being funded
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
well they have dedicated funds and they
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
come to the uh finance committee with an
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
a suggested budget and if the
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
legislature votes on that that's how
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
much money is appropriate ated from
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
their dedicated fund that they can spend
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
now there are funds that are continually
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
appropriated um that the legislature has
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
asked agencies to um spend as they need
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
to but those are only allowed through
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
statute right when you look at the
 
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
budget process and look at House Bill
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
one house bill one will have budget for
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
each of the agencies and there'll be a
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
total appropriation and then it will say
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
revenues will be so much from The
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
General one so much from
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the so much from whatever other funds
 
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.110 align:start position:0%
the so much from whatever other funds
there

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
are and will deal primarily with the
 
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.630 align:start position:0%
are and will deal primarily with the
general

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
fund correct representative major I have
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
yes um getting back to this question of
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
a single number or a range
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
um the for for sure in the end it's a
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
single number that goes into the budget
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
and uh that um in the in the end Ways
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
and Means has to come down in a single
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
number but um what I'm wondering about
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
is earlier on we're early in the process
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
and if it becomes evidence that this
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
committee sees a significant range of
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
possibility and is
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
uncertain it seems to me that it would
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
be helpful to find to know that and um
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
to express our our estimate of that
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
early juncture as a uh as a range and
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
also an historical thing I'm I may be
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
misremembering but uh in the last
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
session when we were confronted with so
 
00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:20.950 align:start position:0%
session when we were confronted with so
much

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
uncertainty um didn't we uh send forward
 
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.149 align:start position:0%
uncertainty um didn't we uh send forward
AR

00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:28.789 align:start position:0%
 
range

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
Reon major could I answer that sure we
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
we agreed um to send ranges to as the
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
update to the revenues okay on in in I
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
was it the fall or the late or June it
 
00:27:50.509 --> 00:27:50.519 align:start position:0%
was in June repi yeah in June and we
 
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
sent H our estimate of how bad or how
 
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
how decent the revenues could get it was
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
pretty Grim in those days uh so that was
 
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
that's the first time I think that we've
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
ever done that and I hope it will be
 
00:28:11.549 --> 00:28:11.559 align:start position:0%
able to be the last but we might want to
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
do that um later
 
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559 align:start position:0%
on for instance when a representative
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
major starts arguing with the senate
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
about the revenue estimat which is not a
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
fun thing to do uh that he if he has a
 
00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
range in front of
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
him he can feel a little bit more
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable maybe about going up to
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
where they want to
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
go our first battle is is to get the
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
budget through the house and I'm in
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
constant communication with Ken wer
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
who's chairman of
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
finance and he and I will be
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
talking almost
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
daily on where things are going relative
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
revenues they they want to know and we
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
want to share our information with them
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
so they understand too this is a working
 
00:29:06.799 --> 00:29:09.590 align:start position:0%
so they understand too this is a working
progress

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
progress
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
so and we need to continue doing that
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
process Mr
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
chairman yes represent Elliot uh on line
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
28 am I reading that correctly is that
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
yep almost three bill
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
you any other questions um before we go
 
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
agenda Norm can you hear me yes uh just
 
00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:49.519 align:start position:0%
on repres Aly was that the when we did
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
the range is uh did that become a house
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
resolution or that was just
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
informational that we we gave to
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
everybody it was a vers of HR on the
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
house resolution for for the estimates
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
but as you know the those HRS go back on
 
00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:08.919 align:start position:0%
the table and they die at the end of the
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
year right right I can't remember if we
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
can look them up in the in the history
 
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.669 align:start position:0%
can look them up in the in the history
or

00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
not or if they are removed from the
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
system okay I just want major if I might
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay yeah you can search the house
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
resolution just as you would search a
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
bill in the um search function on the
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
website on the general court website um
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
and you did it was house resolution I
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
believe 16 that was your um provided the
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
ranges this Summer that you brought to
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
your um your body and and voted on or
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
and then um tabled them and as repon Al
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
me said at the end of the session
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
anything that was left on the table uh
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
dies and goes away so it starts with a
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
fresh slate with this new um
 
00:30:56.919 --> 00:30:59.110 align:start position:0%
fresh slate with this new um
session

00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and and the official
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
estimates will be part of when you vote
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
the budget either in house bill one
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
or that another
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
one so over the period from February
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
through June we may come out with a
 
00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
number of different Revenue
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
estimates and whether in ranges or in
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
single numbers but nothing counts counts
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
until the final budget is passed and
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
numbers so that's why we'll continue
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
working on these until we do get a
 
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.990 align:start position:0%
working on these until we do get a
budget

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
CL any other questions
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
comments all right then
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's 9:33 we'll go to the revenues
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
collected by the Department of Revenue
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
Administration here to talk of us on
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
that is Melissa Rollins senior financial
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
analyst from the Department of Revenue
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
and Devin rodri financial analyst from
 
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.230 align:start position:0%
and Devin rodri financial analyst from
the

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:20.909 --> 00:32:20.919 align:start position:0%
Department good morning Mr chair and
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rollins Department of Revenue
 
00:32:26.629 --> 00:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
and with me is Devin Rodrick senior
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
financial analyst for the Department can
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
you hear me okay yes and I think Chris
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
has his hand up before I start go ahead
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
Chris I just wanted um to make sure that
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
the committee understood that the
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
agencies were invited to more respond to
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
the questions you might have um I they
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
weren't instructed to do another
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
presentation though I think um if
 
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
they're just talking about what they
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
provided last week most agencies can do
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
that but I just wanted to make sure the
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
committee understood that my thought was
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
you were going to be discussing the
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
revenues with your with each other and
 
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
rely on the agencies um for any
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
but I just I just want to make sure that
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
that that was heard and because some
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
agencies might be surprised when when
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
they get on the call and you asked them
 
00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:15.629 align:start position:0%
they get on the call and you asked them
to

00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
present but I will um alert them that
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
you may ask them to kind of review what
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
they provided to the committee last
 
00:33:22.039 --> 00:33:25.350 align:start position:0%
they provided to the committee last
week

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
okay all right Melissa and Devin it's
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
yours yes thank you Chris for um
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
clarifying that I don't have an official
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
presentation to present um I was just
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
going to wait for you to sort of take
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
your cue on what youd like from us
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
however you did you did State um a few
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
minutes ago that you um kind of wanted
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
us to explain how we got to our high and
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
low ranges so we're happy to do that if
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
that works for you Mr chair yes
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay then with that Q I'll um
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
I'll start with business taxes and then
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
we can pause after that and see if
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
there's any questions um so as Chris
 
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:08.839 align:start position:0%
stated I don't know if it'd be helpful
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
for Chris to have his screen shared for
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes so you do want me to share my screen
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
yes okay because they're going to go
 
00:34:23.839 --> 00:34:26.710 align:start position:0%
yes okay because they're going to go
through

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.149 align:start position:0%
 
them

00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
moment can you guys see the screen
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
can okay so if you're ready I'll get
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
started um so for business taxes on the
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
799.99 um I'll start with fiscal year 21
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
and then we can ask questions and then
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
we can chat about fiscal year 22 and 23
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
if that
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
works so for fiscal year 21 these
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
estimates were provided prior to um
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
January 15th I think we we had just
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
finished the 15th but we didn't have all
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
the revenues in from the 15th as it was
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
a holiday um so these numbers have
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
increased slightly however the way we
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
got to our
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
which we've we've chatted about this in
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
other estimates is for business tax it's
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit different that we've looked
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
at each of the different voucher types
 
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
so for the new members on the committee
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
the voucher types are estimate payments
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
which are quarterly estimate payments
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
which are there's a couple of things to
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
talk about for estimate payments one
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
they're the most recent and active
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
payment that will receive because they
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
can be paid on the the quarter that just
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
ended so it's more upto-date information
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
however taxpayers can also o pay these
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
estimates based on prior year tax return
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
so they're not 100% accurate and two
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
they're probably one of the most Vol
 
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
volatile payments that we receive as
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
they are just a paper form with no
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
information coming in they are an
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
estimate and they can result in either
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
too much or too little taxes paid but
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
again it does give us some some inside
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
information as to how business taxes are
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
potentially performing we also have
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
returns and extension returns and
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
extension payments um these are payments
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
that are filed when the return is due
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
for calendar years that's March and
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
April uh these payments return payments
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
obviously are TR up the payment that was
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
short based on their estimate payments
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
and then extension payments are similar
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
to an estimate as they are just an
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
estimate of what the payment the final
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
payment should be it does not come in
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
with a return the return is due seven
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
months later and it can result in
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
a refund when that return is filed seven
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
months later and then we have tax notice
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
payments which are essentially bills
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
that were sent out to taxpayers who
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
underpaid their tax
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
liability and lastly we have refunds
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
which are just essentially overpayments
 
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.030 align:start position:0%
which are just essentially overpayments
of

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
taxes where they asked for the funds
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
back so when we did our fiscal year 21
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
estimate payments for the remaining year
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
um we looked at those different voucher
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
types and based on what we had seen from
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
March estimate payments through current
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
for the low we adjusted our estimates
 
00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.950 align:start position:0%
for the low we adjusted our estimates
down

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
-3% compared to Prior year and returns
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
and extensions were down negative 18%
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
from prior year the negative
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
18% is equivalent to what we saw back in
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
the last recession even though we know
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
these are different there were some
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
similarities in payments were flowing in
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
and then we made some adjustments to
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
account for the economic
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
condition so that's our low range that
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
low range with the anomalous receivable
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
gets us to about 2% ahead of
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
plan and then looking at the high range
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
we did the same sort of exercise where
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
we looked at the different voucher types
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
to sort of adjust that because they're
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
reflecting different activity um during
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
the year and we had that where estimates
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
were flat and then returns and
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
extensions um were a decrease of 9% so
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
we sort of cut that 18% in half and
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
that's because what we're looking at
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
currently um coming in with the
 
00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable removed were about
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
177% ahead of plan however we still have
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
a good chunk of Revenue to come in for
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
um the business taxes and the returns
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
that are due in March and April those
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
are the returns s that are fully
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
affected um by the covid pandemic and
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
we're not sure at this point based on
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
estimates in the increase in Revenue if
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
those estimates are flowing in based on
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
prior year Revenue so again taxpayers
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
can make estimates based on their prior
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
year tax liability as long as they pay
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
100% of it so if it's based on that and
 
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
then they're going to True up those
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
payments when their returns are filed
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
meaning they will have refund requests
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
in March and April um and those returns
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
and extension payments will be down or
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
if they're going to
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
um flow in as is with just a slight
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
decrease so that's where our ranges are
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
coming in to be 2% to 6% ahead of plan
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
for the low and high happy to answer any
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
questions for fiscal year 21 estimates
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
or 20 yeah estimates yeah I have a
 
00:39:56.319 --> 00:39:59.349 align:start position:0%
or 20 yeah estimates yeah I have a
question

00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
repr yeah so Melissa um we're what are
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
we we're just starting February and U uh
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
much of the activity I think that uh
 
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
businesses will be paying taxes
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
on um in the next several months has
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
already occurred but some of it has not
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
and my question goes
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
to what
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh to what degree is the revenue that is
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
still to be still going to come
 
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
in um dependent on changes in
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances that we don't know right
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
now that could occur between now and the
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
end of June so suppose some major
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
development occurs uh that uh I won't
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
even try to characterize that uh affects
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
business Outlook in some way
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
um to what extent given that a lot of
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
the uh Revenue that we're going to get
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
is based on things that have already
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
happened might that change uh affect
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
receive so that's a good question
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative ases um off the top of my
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
head I can't think of anything that may
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
come up that will drastically change
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
what we've seen already
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
um my thoughts would be that taxpayers
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
are at this point now that we have
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
completed the year are sort of looking
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
through their their business records and
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
sort of seeing how they've they've ended
 
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
up in the the the year for the year um I
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
think anecdotally like I said we've
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
heard that estimates had been
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
made based on prior years activity which
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
would not reflect the current covid
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
situation um and then as we're entering
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
now what we also have for March and a
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
April April and June um for estimates
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
would reflect current activity so I
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
think some of the current activity uh
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
that hasn't happened yet would be if
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
there is or as that second round of PPP
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
money comes out um that that could
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
potentially affect the first and second
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
quarter estimate payments um by how much
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
I think we're unsure at this point as
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
really hasn't gone out yet off the top
 
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
of my head that's the only thing that I
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
can think of that would affect the
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
current Financial environment that we um
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
that may affect payments because as of
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
right now for the returns and extensions
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
for calendar year filers their activity
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
is basically wrapped up right
 
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.150 align:start position:0%
is basically wrapped up right
yeah

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
Melissa that I always kind of worry
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
about is the credit carry forward and
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic what do you think the effect on
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
the credit carry for will
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
be U after March and April results come
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
in I know that it's been growing every
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
year I think it's up to
 
00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:27.670 align:start position:0%
year I think it's up to
about

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
quarter of a million dollars um $250
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
million so so if you could say a few
 
00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
words on this sure so first off for the
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
new the new committee members I'll
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
explain what a credit carryover is so a
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
credit carryover is when a taxpayer pays
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
more than their liability and it's an
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
overpayment so with that overpayment
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
they can elect to take those funds in
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
two ways they can either ask for a
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
refund of that money on file or they can
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
request a have those excess funds
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
unfiled carry forward to the next year
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
so that carry forward amount also known
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
as a credit carryover is the money
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's available for taxpayers to use on
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
the next return or to continue to carry
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
forward on each return so representative
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
Majors absolutely correct the funds that
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
have been carried forward keep growing I
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
do believe they're around a quarter of a
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
million dollars I don't have the exact
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
amount in front of me
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
um um in
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
the a quar of a billion sorry about that
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes you're right quar of a billion
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
dollars um I for those funds so it's
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
hard to predict with this just because
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
again we haven't seen a pandemic before
 
00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:43.559 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to see what taxpayers would
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
be there could be a potential that these
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers could utilize more of those
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
funds on file so if they come into a
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
situation where their return is due in
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
March and April and they owe more funds
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
than what they had paid in their
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
estimate payments they now can utilize
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
those extra funds on file more than they
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
would in a typical year which then would
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
reduce our returns and extension
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
payments because they wouldn't need to
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
pay they would just sort of take the
 
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
money on file that has already been paid
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the department so I think it is a
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
possibility I think with our reduction
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
of 18% for returns and extensions on the
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
low end and the reduction of 9% for
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
returns and extensions on the high end I
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
think does take into
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
account uh some usage of the credit
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
carryovers however I always want to note
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
with credit carryovers that although
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
that number is rather large we do look
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
at that closely and um a lot of the the
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the that money is used up
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
every year it's sort of a wash Rin
 
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:51.800 align:start position:0%
repeat where taxpayers utilize that
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
credit carryover on file for their first
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
and second quarter estimate payments and
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
then they pay third and fourth quarter
 
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
estimate payments they have extra money
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
and they carry it forward and they
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
continue to use that um over and over
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
again so the full extent of the
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
liability is never you know $250 million
 
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you welcome any further
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
questions at this point Norm It's
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
Pat Melissa yeah um I I can't tell if
 
00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
people hear me because my my machine is
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
not the microphone isn't working that
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
well but speak louder I'm trying I'm
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
trying so uh this is different than
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
anything we've faced in all the years
 
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
I've done this um we've come out of
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
recessions and things like that uh but
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
usually fundamentals are bad when you're
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
coming out of a recession that that
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
created the recession fundamentals were
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
good going into covid and so the real
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
issue I think before all of us is you
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
know when is the vaccine gonna uh take
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
hold uh is co going to diminish it's a
 
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
guessing game as to when we think
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
normality will return I'm sure every
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
business is having the same conversation
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
about their estimates but again I think
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
it's a little different than coming out
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
of a recession and that the fundamentals
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
are so good we heard from the economists
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
that there's pent up demand we heard
 
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
from the economists that there's a lot
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
of cash on the sidelines waiting to be
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
spent but nowhere to spend it uh so I it
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
I I it's not an easy job for you or for
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
us I think to especially the business
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
taxes to uh to estimate what what the
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
companies are thinking right now it's
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
more of a comment but uh how much of
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
your conversation was around covid I can
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
imagine it was quite a
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
bit yeah great Point representative
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
abrami and I can hear you just fine just
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
so you know um a lot a lot to be honest
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
with you um very hard to predict taxes
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
during this time as um other St states
 
00:47:58.750 --> 00:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
are facing this as well we've never seen
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
anything like this before it came on
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
really fast uh as um representative I
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
believe Aly alluded to earlier when we
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
were ending June we really thought we
 
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
were going to see this huge tank in
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
business taxes and we were going to take
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
massive losses and then um come to find
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
out we were we were wrong with that that
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know the federal government um
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
definitely helped out with some stimulus
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
packages as did the state of sure and it
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
seemed to help support this and we also
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
saw this really fast Trend in change in
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
behavior of where people just shifted so
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
they shifted from you know going into
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
stores to going online and then we saw
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
people being home so being home in this
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic we there was a lot of activity
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
at box stores and different home
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
improvement stores to you know fix up
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
their homes which then resulted in a
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
change into the real estate transfer tax
 
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.349 align:start position:0%
change into the real estate transfer tax
so

00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
it it's been a guessing game to be
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
honest with you uh every single month we
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
just are are unsure on how this is going
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
to perform because we have nothing
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
historically to compare it to as you
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
said it's not like a typical recession
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like a reverse Nike swoop
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know we we were at one point we
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
dropped way down then we're coming back
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
up so it definitely has been a challenge
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
to predict I think that's where our 22
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
and 23 numbers come in where you were
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
asking about the pend up demand and the
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine with business taxes there's sort
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
of that year lag right as the returns in
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
um returns and extensions are filed a
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
year later based on the prior Year's
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
activity um we may see that decrease in
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
those returns and extensions because of
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
that that pent up demand meaning on the
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
other side of it that people maybe
 
00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:51.799 align:start position:0%
haven't been out gone out and spent as
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
much money as they typically would but
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
once things open up and the vaccine
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
comes we may see more of a growth and um
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses can might you know
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
perform better than they they did during
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
the um the last
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
year we have three hands rais
 
00:50:10.119 --> 00:50:11.150 align:start position:0%
year we have three hands rais
representative

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair uh good morning
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
Melissa and thanks for taking my
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
question with with regard to assistance
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
from the federal
 
00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:22.599 align:start position:0%
government if those loans are forgiven
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
that income becomes taxable to New
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses can you explain to
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
me how you factored that into your
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
estimates sure I don't first off I want
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
to say you are correct with the PPP
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
money that um if those loans are
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
forgiven we would see that um in the
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax if they spent it
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
on wages so we didn't apply a particular
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
number to um to our estimates however we
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
did adjust them up further than what we
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
had anticipated seeing of what the the
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
loss would be because we know and we saw
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
actually the estimates not drop as far
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
as we had anticipated so we made an
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
assumption that these estimates are
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
padded with um some of the federal
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
stimulus programs as well as the state
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
programs um that helped support these
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
businesses in times where they were um
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
they may have been struggling and we
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
would have seen a further loss in
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
estimate payments um so I think we
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
initially thought we'd see a 12 to 15%
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
loss in estimate payments we then reduce
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
that to 10% and then reduced it to 3%
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
and that sort of factors in um those
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
those funds that were helping out
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
businesses very good thank you you're
 
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
welcome repres
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
n thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming in to speak
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
with us and help us through this I'm one
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the new guys so um I I believe that
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
you sort of touched on an answer that I
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
was going to for represent bursting um I
 
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about the the business
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
defaults that happened within the state
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
during uh the pandemic um I know in our
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
our little town here we had uh we had 11
 
00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:12.200 align:start position:0%
vacant stores in our little town at one
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
time uh I know that some of those have
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
come back but um we know that most of
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
our business taxes are collected from
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
our larger uh corporations um is there
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
going to be uh too much of of a hit on
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
us from the the amount of small to
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
medium businesses that did actually have
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
doors yeah great question and welcome to
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
the Ways and Means Committee um yeah so
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
right now looking at the way the
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
business tax is performed the large
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
driver of these payments is really the
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
cor the large corporations they're
 
00:52:50.829 --> 00:52:50.839 align:start position:0%
really pushing this forward and the
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses which we are
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
typically the
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
proprietorships uh those businesses not
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
um they they make up a much smaller
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the revenue but they have
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
definitely been taking a hit they are
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
not their returns and extension payments
 
00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
as well as estimate payments have been
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
down um pretty consistently every month
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
where the corporate the corporate
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
payments and the larger taxpayers have
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
been seeing an increase so I do think
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
they are affected and I'm I hope that
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
they make it out and I hope that they do
 
00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.670 align:start position:0%
they make it out and I hope that they do
well

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have a specific breakdown that
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
analyzes those smaller businesses
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
compared to the business we sort of look
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
at it as an overall whole um because the
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the business is carried by
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
the larger businesses so we do look at
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
them however they're not a huge factor
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
in the revenue
 
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:48.799 align:start position:0%
estimates thank you very
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
much great uh represent Aly followed by
 
00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.750 align:start position:0%
much great uh represent Aly followed by
representative

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:56.440 align:start position:0%
Southwest thank you Mr chairman and we
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
seem to be heading in interesting
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
directions I have something on top of
 
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
Representative nunes's great comment on
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
it's how much work would it be to I've
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
got two actually uh to
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
separate uh those who pay only bet from
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
those who pay uh bet and
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
BPT on to for instance on the on the
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
chart that that we get each time that
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
shows us the
 
00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.079 align:start position:0%
monthly uh returns
 
00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:38.839 align:start position:0%
estimates uh extensions Etc um over the
 
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
last 10 years um wouldn't have to be
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
like that but if just for this last year
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
on the those businesses that we have
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
never done this the businesses that are
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
only paying bet versus the others
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
because it does seem like we do a lot of
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
talking about how people are going to
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
spend a lot more money on after things
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
start to calm down whenever that's going
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
to be um but we don't really know what's
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
happening to those small
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
businesses I think I understand number
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
of them F folded without even doing a
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy so
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
um it would that be a lot of work no no
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
and actually representative elme I do
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
have those numbers for tax year 18 which
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
was our last completed tax year as you
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
know it takes a couple of years a tax
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
year so for tax year um
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
18 40
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
41% um of the business tax filers filed
 
00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
only bet
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
43.4% filed both bet and BPT
 
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
returns and 15 or 16 rounding
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
16% filed um just BPT
 
00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
returns Melissa can you send that to um
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
to me and I'll send it to the committee
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
we sure
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
can if I could follow up on that how do
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
you get to file just a
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
BPT so a BP PT would potentially be um
 
00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:31.039 align:start position:0%
proprietorships that's what's coming to
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
mind off the top of my head so you have
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
somebody who um has their own business
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
they have their gross receipts exceed
 
00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:40.510 align:start position:0%
they have their gross receipts exceed
the

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
50,000 and then um they're not meeting
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
the BET threshold so remember the BET
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
threshold is less than the BPT threshold
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
so they hit the BP threshold with their
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
gross receipts they're required to file
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
based on the greater than 50,000 but
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
could potentially have less than the I'm
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
going off the top of my head I think
 
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
222,000 for um bet they would file the
 
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.910 align:start position:0%
222,000 for um bet they would file the
BPT

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
BPT
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
only that's really interesting uh that
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
includes an awful lot of proprietorships
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
that the person is retiring and they
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
have to sell their interest in what what
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
they've been doing uh what they
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
owned and it ends up in BPT because it's
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of money in one year
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh known about that one for a while but
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the ones that are filing
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
bet do we bet only do we have a way of
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
of looking at this past year on what
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
their their returns and estimates and
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
Etc have
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
been we would we would for tax year 18
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
not for tax year 19 yet as those of the
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
returns that are going to be filed in
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
March and April for calendar year filers
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
and then throughout the next year and a
 
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
half of fisal year filers but could we
 
00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
incomplete we could take a look at
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
what's been filed so
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
far okay thank
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
question I had almost word for word the
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
same question as representative Nunes
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
but as a followup um even though most of
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
the revenue comes from the larger
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
businesses because of this particular
 
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
crisis it just seems we really should be
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
tracking what's happening to our small
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
businesses just to think about the
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
future of New Hampshire because the
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
small businesses really are very
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
important even if they don't have a big
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
impact on Revenue so maybe not for this
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
meeting but it does seem longterm term
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
we really should try to find out who's
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
you okay well no more questions at this
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
point you can continue
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
Melissa okay so I'll move on to fiscal
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
year 22 and 23 so fiscal year 22 and 23
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
we did a growth range of 1% to 3% for 22
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
and then for 23 we did a growth range
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
for six uh 4% to
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
6% for fiscal year 22 that information
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
will still have people will still be
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
coming out of the covid pandemic
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
situation so we didn't think the growth
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
would be as large as 23 we're hopefully
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
fingers crossed we're um back to some
 
00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
good some good growth um GDP is expected
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
to be 4.3% for the calendar year and
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2021 and we know that
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
calendar year will be part of fiscal
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
year 22 and then will be um more felt in
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 so we tempered the growth
 
01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
some in 22 and then picked up the growth
 
01:00:14.799 --> 01:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
some in 22 and then picked up the growth
in

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
23 happy to answer any questions on 22
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
taxes br
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
you did say that again uh for 22 and 23
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
the GDP estimates that you used and and
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
where you got those
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
from so the GDP is expected to be 4.3%
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
that was reported out of
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
Kiplinger um and that was for calendar
 
01:00:44.359 --> 01:00:46.270 align:start position:0%
Kiplinger um and that was for calendar
year

01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
2021 so we tempered that growth in 2022
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
because that calendar year 2021 will be
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
felt over a couple of f years with the
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
bulk being in
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
2023 uh as we have hopefully um full
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
recovery if not more recover exceeded
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
recovery once the pandemic is has slowed
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
and we're we're kind of back to normal
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
so that was for calendar year uh which
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
calendar year was Kipling or saying
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
2021 okay over 2020 did you use any
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
other uh future you know any other GDP
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
estimates from any of the uh the gurus
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 so for the 4.3 I should
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
have explained Kiplinger takes a look at
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
multiple gdps um GDP growth rates and
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
provides an average so the one to three
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
and the four to six was scooping in
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
um sort of all of the gdps that they
 
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
report on which was quite a few of them
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
I understand that uh but how about for
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
future years day was there a crystal
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
ball for uh GDP growth in future years
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
there was not at that at this time I'm
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
not sure as of um this was as of a
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
couple weeks
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
ago okay I just wanted to make sure I
 
01:02:11.789 --> 01:02:11.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
you okay uh repr
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:26.789 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
you're muted Susan that was I thought I
 
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
thought I'd unmuted you had I was um
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
putting Norm's hand I mean uh Patrick's
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
hand down in it oh sorry sh you're in
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
progress of doing something
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
sorry okay on can can you look at the
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
Kiplinger again to see if they put out
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
more um more estimates for later I but
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking at is uh the larger
 
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
corporations have been doing well as far
 
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:06.039 align:start position:0%
as I can tell one because they were
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
really good at pivoting to something
 
01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:10.039 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
needed and could charge a lot more money
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
for it because everybody's in
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
crisis and the second one is that
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
they've still got all of those corporate
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
tax cuts from the federal uh uh tax uh
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
reform in 17 end of
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
17 so um is there any idea that you've
 
01:03:38.269 --> 01:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
heard in DC that they might be reversing
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
those corporate tax cuts or are they
 
01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
operating under the presumption that
 
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
that this is not a good time to reverse
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
anybody's tax
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
Goods uh that's a good question I
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything yet
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
um our predictions are based on what is
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
sort of happening today and hasn't
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
adjusted if something does change it
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't take into effect if um there is
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
um if the Biden tax plan changes
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
anything um it just is as of what's
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
going on today but we we definitely keep
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
a close eye on that and we'll make any
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
adjustments if something were to change
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
just give it a little more
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
time yeah the other thing that that
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
comes to mind at this point is the
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
variants for the covid which are um
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
making a lot of the medical personnel
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
very nervous um that there may be
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
mutations that mean that they have to
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
develop new vaccines and set us all back
 
01:04:51.390 --> 01:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
do we do were these Kiplinger estimates
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
all before the variant problem came up
 
01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
um I would say potentially um they were
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
done two weeks ago when we created the
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates for your range um so I
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
can't answer that but I definitely will
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
look into it that's great because I
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
remember trying to look up estimates
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
several years on the on the web and um a
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
lot most of what I was getting was up to
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
11 months old I I don't know what
 
01:05:27.039 --> 01:05:28.470 align:start position:0%
11 months old I I don't know what
Kiplinger

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
Kiplinger
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
uses I'd like to start hearing some
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
questions from the people new to the
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
happen you you'll learn a lot from the
 
01:05:44.829 --> 01:05:44.839 align:start position:0%
questions that those that have been on
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
the committee but I'm sure that those
 
01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
that haven't been uh we have questions
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for the
 
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
encouragement chairman
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
major we heard uh in testimony last week
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
PPP raises a question of debt
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
forgiveness debt forgiveness is normally
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
taxable income but I believe the cares
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
act Exempted uh that on the federal
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
level so we have a potential situation
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
where PPP debt forgiven is
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
at the state level um but on the other
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
hand I suppose that the qualifi
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
qualifying criteria for PPP uh and for
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
forgiveness was that you have to
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
demonstrate you actually expended it on
 
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
keep keeping people employed and certain
 
01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:45.799 align:start position:0%
specific business expenses so perhaps
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
it's a wash somebody was expressing
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
concern that there could be an
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
unanticipated extra tax hit from this
 
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.269 align:start position:0%
unanticipated extra tax hit from this
see

01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
to Me Maybe that's not true and I wonder
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
if it's something you've considered does
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
it represent a a neutral or a potential
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
increase in tax
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
income sure great question I think on my
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
end you cut out just a little bit here
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
and there so I'm going to answer it to
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
what I think I heard but if I miss a
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
section please feel free to let me know
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
um so yeah there were some changes for
 
01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
um so yeah there were some changes for
the

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
PPP for the um Federal level where they
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
have an exclusion um and an inclusion
 
01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:32.799 align:start position:0%
where they exclude it from the gross
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
income um but then they have an
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
inclusion for the D deductibility of the
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
PPP however we're not a Conformity state
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
so we do not conform or we do static
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
Conformity meaning we do not conform to
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
the most recent um Car Act tax law
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
changes so that change um that the
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
federal government did made for the PPP
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
does not currently affect New Hampshire
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
so we are
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
still um we would still be getting the
 
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
tax on the business Enterprise tax if it
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
was spent on wages which it seems like
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
it would be as that was um one of the
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
requirements for the loan forgiveness
 
01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:17.480 align:start position:0%
program we would still be getting those
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
taxes for that and our estimates for the
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
business tax ranges have included um
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
those funds in there and like I said as
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
of right now nothing has changed for the
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
taxability of the PPP for the State of
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so our estimates wouldn't
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
be adjusted um based on what the federal
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
government changes have been did I
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
question represent spells I think you
 
01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
did answer it for the most part yes you
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
um you answered for the most part but I
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
guess I'm the ACT actual event of forg
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
ability by and large has not occurred
 
01:08:58.799 --> 01:09:02.110 align:start position:0%
ability by and large has not occurred
yet

01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
right uh that's a good question um I'm
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
not sure if that calculation has
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
occurred yet but it will occur by the
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
filed okay interesting
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
variable see that one more time
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
please I I think it's an interesting
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
variable that obviously wasn't
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated last
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
is okay representa
 
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr chairman I hope I don't
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
embarrass myself with this question but
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a learning process
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
for me um there's nothing to embarrass
 
01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
you there a learning process for
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
everybody uh thank you sir um I'd like
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
to ask the question about um last bym we
 
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
put in uh into statute some triggers
 
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
that would raise the BET BPT rates if uh
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh revenues fell below a certain point
 
01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
um has any of that set in place and or
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
is that going to be set in place and the
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
second half of that question is um if
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
there are changes in bills coming
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
through to that statute that may be
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
implemented what type of proposed effect
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
are we going to look at
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay do that any of that make sense I
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
yeah sure it's a it's a great question
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
um so for the rate changes you are
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
correct the trigger was not met so
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
because the trigger was not met the REM
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
the tax rates remain the same as they
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
were um so there's no
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
impact being made to the business taxes
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
because again the trigger was not met so
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
it just the rate just continues as it
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
has been um
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
and ask for future tax law changes when
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
doing the revenue estimates we do the
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
estimates based on current law so if
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
there are changes for instance hb10 that
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
we spoke to um I can't remember it was
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
early in their week or last week um if
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
that is changed those will be added onto
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
a surplus statement and those fiscal
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
impacts would be adjusted for fiscal
 
01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
year 22 and 23 based on um based on the
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact that we provided
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
that was the answer I was looking for
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Murphy Oh Thank
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman U more in thank you for
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
reaching out to us who are new to the
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee but one is an observation and
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
another is maybe a more specific
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
question uh following up on
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative aly's you know concerns
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
about when these uh GDP predictions were
 
01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
made I would probably
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
bet that they were made well before the
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
more recent CDC and Dr fouchi concerns
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the variants have come out uh
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
my concern is clearly that these
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
variants are going to be a game Cher
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we may see in March in the
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
springtime sometime um and unless there
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
is a significant shift in production of
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine booster shots and even
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics um I I worry about the the
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
first year of the bium and any Revenue
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know um projections upward um and
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
even if we have a significant amount of
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines out there the behavior changes
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
are going to take a while to happen so
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's more of an observation which in
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
my mind speaks to a more conservative
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
Approach at least in the first half of
 
01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:49.830 align:start position:0%
Approach at least in the first half of
the

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
banum my more specific question I guess
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
the in the market-based sourcing and
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor transitions that we
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
are making uh how is that affecting the
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
highs and lows in the estimates that we
 
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
see uh from the Dr estimates on um
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
revenues uh do they have any impact at
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
all is that a naive question or uh I
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
just didn't know if these two trans this
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
transition that we're going through as
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
well uh has any significant or how does
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
it have an impact on the these um
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
estimates these ranges thank
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
you so those are some some great
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
questions um yeah any anything from here
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
on out that changes is going to be
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
challenging because obviously when we do
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
our Revenue estimates it's with the
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
information that we have as of when we
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
do those informations so if these
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
variants do become a a key part and do
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
affect consumer spending um and
 
01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
businesses then it will adjust the
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates so that's why we build
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the range to make sure we have a
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
lowend and a high end to sort of say
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
where do you think this will fall um and
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
obviously these are just our opinions so
 
01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't feel that they have
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted enough as the committee you
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
guys have the right to go lower than
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
what we have or higher than what we have
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
and for your second question for the
 
01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
market base sourcing and the single
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
sales um they're really hard to take
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
into account because market-based Source
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
sourcing we don't have an estimated
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
impact of what that's going to look like
 
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
yet that is going to hit in fiscal year
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
22 but we have not provided a fiscal
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
impact so I would say our ranges are
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
accounting just for some growth but not
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily anything tied to or
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
attributable to market-based sourcing
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
and for single sales we won't see that
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
until fiscal year 23 if it's not
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
postponed um by the legislation that has
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
been put forth and again single sales is
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
hard to do um a fiscal impact on as
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of volatility there on
 
01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
which way it swings year to year um so
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 is what we anticipate the
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
growth to be the four to six% but it
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
does not tie directly to uh single sales
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and as a a quick followup I
 
01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
was very happy to hear when
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gario asked
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative chairman maor
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
you know the process going forward
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
because if there are significant changes
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
over the next couple months with regard
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
to the treatment in vaccinations for
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
covid we'll at least have a chance to
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
re-review once again uh in June so
 
01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.030 align:start position:0%
re-review once again uh in June so
that's

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
hopeful okay representor brahney and
 
01:15:46.590 --> 01:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
then I have to step away for about two
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
minutes I'll be right
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
back okay um thank you um I just want to
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
clarify the the triggers uh uh unless
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
you had a right but I just wanted there
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
the second half of the trigger that
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't mentioned there really were two
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
triggers we had our estimated
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
revenues and the compromise was if those
 
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
revenues fell below a certain percentage
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
that we would roll back the taxes to the
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
prior years rates that trigger wasn't
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
hit but there was also a trigger that
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
the same percentage going the other way
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
it revenues had to exceed that
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
percentage for the for the tax continued
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
tax reductions to happen that that that
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
trigger uh was not hit so uh so the
 
01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
first one was hit it uh but it it wasn't
 
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
both weren't hit okay so what that meant
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
was that all of the future tax cuts
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
stopped that's why there's House Bill 10
 
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 10 is going to uh ca for
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
continuation of those those tax cuts
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
going forward so I just wanted to
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that thank you
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
just to make another comment on that uh
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
Patrick um or representative ofy to be
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
formal um the uh I think think there may
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
be confusion about the
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing as to whether there's an ongoing
 
01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
trigger there's not right it's history
 
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
now the the trigger was not met and
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
going forward it's uh part of our past
 
01:17:22.629 --> 01:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
but not part of our future I think
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's for sure uh
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
right no you asking me uh represent ases
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no it's it's done right yeah I just
 
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to I'm not sure that some of the
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
new people really understand that I
 
01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to be that's why I brought this
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
up and that that's history now uh
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
basically what happened uh when when the
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
revenues were finally calculated for
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
last year was that we we froze at at a
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
rate and stopped any future tax cuts
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
that uh that were going to happen and
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's why it required House Bill 10 if
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
we want to continue with those tax CS we
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
had planned house house bill 10 has to
 
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
be passed that's where we're at right
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
now thank
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
you represent Al after that we can go on
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to close this
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
particular piece with we knew in June on
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we were not going to meet the
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
trigger there was maybe a quarter of a
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
percent chance that something weird
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
would happen and the CER would say that
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
June okay um Melissa you can
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
continue on the on the meals and Rental
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
tax sure thanks moving on to the meals
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
and rentals tax we have a low of
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
294.50 million and a high of
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
3125 million as you know the meals and
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
rentals tax has been the hardest hit um
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
by covid out of all of the
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
taxes our our low um is continuing with
 
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:16.870 align:start position:0%
taxes our our low um is continuing with
a

01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
25% loss compared to taxes for February
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
March and April and then slowly coming
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
out of that loss um for May and June
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
toga 19% and then negative um 177% which
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
is reflective of May and June and
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
September and October of the prior year
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
so our low is taking a deeper loss and
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
saying we're coming out of it more
 
01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
slowly and then looking at our high it's
 
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
more optimistic saying that February
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
will be a 25% loss and then we SL slowly
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
come out of it through March April May
 
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
and June with March being a 10% loss
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
compared to Prior year I mean compared
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
to plan and then April May and June
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
being a 5% loss um compared to plan
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
January ended just for um some
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
informational purposes January ended
 
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.189 align:start position:0%
informational purposes January ended
atga

01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
atga
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
-30% uh below plan and January is for
 
01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.629 align:start position:0%
-30% uh below plan and January is for
December

01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
December
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
activity happy to answer any questions
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
rentals this is the one that's taken
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
biggest hit yes I have one uh Mr
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
chairman ra your hand sorry speaking
 
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
John representative janigian yes
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
represent um so the um Melissa that when
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
you just said 30% January's 30% % below
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
plan um is that so it's even worse below
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
I well compared to January of last year
 
01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
how much is it down or is that what you
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
mean it's down
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
30% so compared to last it's 30% below
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
plan plan had some growth built in so
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
compared to last year December activity
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
um it was down
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.709 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions on the meals
 
01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.750 align:start position:0%
uh any further questions on the meals
and

01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
rooms wow oh I have my hand up Norm
 
01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
Pat doesn't doesn't show up on my screen
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
sorry May went down so um I'm just this
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
random thought here maybe maybe we
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
should reach out to the Restaurant
 
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
Association to give us an idea of how
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
many restaurants they think uh that will
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
not survive all of
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
this uh I think that'll give us a pretty
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
good idea given that most of this tax is
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants and not not
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
hotels um I'm willing to do that if you
 
01:22:11.229 --> 01:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.239 --> 01:22:13.270 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
fine I think that'll give us just a
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
gauge of you know the recovery rate you
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
know the recovery rate may be lower than
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
we think because a lot of them just a
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the restaurant didn't didn't
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
survive thank you we can call in
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
somebody that
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
represents the restant
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
association at our next
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.669 align:start position:0%
 
represent

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
gamalo thank you chairman um I was just
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
wondering where Patrick got that
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
information that most of our revenue
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
losses just from the restaurants it
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
01:23:01.229 --> 01:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
the hotel industry isn't doing well at
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
all so do we need to ask them as well do
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
you think we have both sets of opinions
 
01:23:07.719 --> 01:23:11.310 align:start position:0%
you think we have both sets of opinions
and

01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
figures I agree with you the model why
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
all I met all I met was that 80% of 80%
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
of the total revenue was from
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants actually I agree hotels are
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
hurt as well Big Time totally car rental
 
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
places I can give you some more
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
information on that if you if you'd
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
like so for the the month for the
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
December activity hotels were down
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
39.7% which was a 2% um increase in what
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
they were or excuse me 2% decrease from
 
01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
what they were down the prior month in
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
November they're definitely taking a
 
01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:53.639 align:start position:0%
larger hit than the food um food or
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
restaurants is down
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
18.6% and they also gained um a
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
percentage Point compared to the prior
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
month so both taxes in December versus
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
November did a little bit better than
 
01:24:08.350 --> 01:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
they did in the prior months I do want
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
to note when you look at these different
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
categories we've talked about this um a
 
01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
fair amount in our other
 
01:24:17.470 --> 01:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
presentations that full service hotels
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
are really taking the biggest hit so the
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar hotels that the bigger
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
businesses they were down 45.9 9% but
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
when you look at
 
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
airbnbs um you look at you know online
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
platforms people are staying more at
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
those and those actually the activity
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
was up 13.2% so they're ahead of Prior
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
year where the brick and mortar hotels
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
were down and then looking at
 
01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:47.639 align:start position:0%
food again just this shift and Trend I
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
think of where people feel feel
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable or safe full service
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants were down 27%
 
01:24:57.629 --> 01:24:57.639 align:start position:0%
um compared to last December but fast
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
food exceeded last December and was up
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
3.2% so those are just some of the
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
shifts and trends that we're seeing um
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
where people are making some different
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
choices versus going out to eat and
 
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
sitting down in a restaurant it seems
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
like they're feeling more safe going
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
through a drive-thru or staying at maybe
 
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
a room rental or a a full house versus
 
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
staying at a a hotel could you send us
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
this the latest
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
information there more
 
01:25:25.239 --> 01:25:27.310 align:start position:0%
information there more
sure

01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
do represent YY followed by represent
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
Aly while we're talking about uh uh the
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
industry one of the things I've noticed
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
in our area is several of the uh
 
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants the small restaurants have
 
01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
decided to take the month of February
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
off not because they're not selling
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
meals but because they just they can't
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
afford to stay open with the
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
restrictions that are in place and I'd
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
like to know from the restaurant
 
01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:09.970 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.970 --> 01:26:11.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
well okay we can have a representative
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
from the restaurant and the hotel
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
industry come in and we can ask them
 
01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.229 align:start position:0%
industry come in and we can ask them
that

01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:23.239 --> 01:26:24.910 align:start position:0%
that
question

01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:25.990 align:start position:0%
question
represent

01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
Aly yes I think that probably restaurant
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
and lodging is the one that would be
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
keeping the statistics and that that's
 
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
what Patrick was talking about but
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
following up on representative oery
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of different ways that
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
these the restaurants and I I guess
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
small hotels have been maybe have been
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
closing they some of them that I know
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
personally have just they've just walked
 
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
away they've decided okay I'm TI tired
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
of trying to do a restaurant and without
 
01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
declaring bankruptcy or anything they've
 
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
just gone and on their on the restaurant
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
and Lodging Association and anybody else
 
01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
probably is only going to have a general
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
idea of what how many of those
 
01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
businesses have quit you'll recall that
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
turnover uh turning in the restaurant
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
business anyway on they I I can't
 
01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:27.639 align:start position:0%
remember exact what the numbers are but
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
something like 30% that get started die
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
within a year or
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
50% um and then somebody else tries it
 
01:27:39.550 --> 01:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
or they try it somewhere else and so
 
01:27:41.109 --> 01:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to be really difficult to
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
track but maybe if if we asked
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant and lodging to make their own
 
01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
categories of who they knew would closed
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
and who they knew was still open and
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
then everything in between or something
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
like that that we might get the best
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
data we
 
01:27:57.199 --> 01:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
data we
can

01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent J
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
again yes thank you Mr chairman um I was
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
just thinking just more of a comment it
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
would be interesting when we get someone
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
from the Restaurant Association to come
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
in one of the questions that would be
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
interesting is I mean we've been talking
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
about how people's habits might have
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
changed and they're not going to full
 
01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
service restaurants however how much of
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
that is habits or or not habits but just
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
what people feel safe and how much of it
 
01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:30.870 align:start position:0%
what people feel safe and how much of it
is

01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
regulation um that might be something
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the restaurant industry could could
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
help us with because if regulation is
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
causing a lot of the downside we might
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
want to look at uh not that we are going
 
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
to address that but we can but that that
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
potentially just a comment thank you
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative hackin Phillips
 
01:28:58.109 --> 01:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chair representative
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
jiki and just exactly pinpointed my my
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
concern was that consumer psychosis and
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
behavior may not be trailing the actual
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
um ability for restaurants and hotels to
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
reopen if if people are not feeling
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable even after vaccination or
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know if the continued variants
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
become worse of for the covid strains I
 
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
think that consumers may be trailing um
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
for quite some time demand may not pick
 
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
up for a longer period of time than we
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate even though the regulations
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know that the government you know
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
state of emergency or
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the certain types of covid
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
protocols may be relaxed consumers may
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
not match that you know uh appetite for
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
going back to sit down dinners and long
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
weekend stays so I think that that
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
consumer Behavior would be such an
 
01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
important piece for us to consider in
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
terms of what how quickly we believe
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
these numbers will rebound I'm not even
 
01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
sure fiscal year 20 22's um anticipation
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
of a 8% increase at the low is um going
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
reality it's the same feeling people
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
have about flying who have always
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
flown even as things change I don't
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
think you're going to get people to fly
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
like they have been till five six years
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
out okay all right uh I don't see
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
represent Aly do you have your hands up
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I I had just one followup for
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant lodging and I think also Dr
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
on if we could on it won't solve these
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
problems of the covid in particular but
 
01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:53.719 align:start position:0%
if we could look at how much how long it
 
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
took for the restaurants and hotels to
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
come out of the Great
 
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
Recession before they they got back to
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
Prior prior taxes or tax or earnings on
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that might give us some kind of
 
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:13.210 align:start position:0%
idea of that side of the
 
01:31:13.210 --> 01:31:15.830 align:start position:0%
idea of that side of the
[Music]

01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:19.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
problem

01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay and we can bring that up when we
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
discuss those revenues
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh let's go into the tobacco
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
tax okay moving on to tobacco tax we
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
243.166 occurred June 1st um our
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
estimates for the low would be remaining
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
at 18% each month ahead of plan for the
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
rest of the year which is um a trend
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
that we've been seeing however we also
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
have been seeing some stock up months so
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
the low doesn't include stock up months
 
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
it's just a straight 18% for the year
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
and then our High um includes those
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
stock up months but at the highest month
 
01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
that we saw so when I say stock up
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
months um if you looked at the revenues
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
over the last um six or seven months
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen this trend of two months of
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
around 18% with the third month being a
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
much higher percent of either somewhere
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 53% increase so September
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
was a 30% increase over plan and then
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
December was 53% increase over plan with
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
the remaining months hovering around
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
18% so our high is sort of continuing
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
that Trend except the high being one of
 
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
the highest months that we saw in
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
December and the low being a continued
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
months and then for our growth for 22
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
and 23 we have a negative 3% loss to 0%
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and a Nega 4% loss to negative 1% once
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
we hit fiscal year 22 we will sort of be
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
normalized compared to Prior year
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
because we will have the full impact of
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
the um Massachusetts flavor band in
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
effect and we feel that it will start to
 
01:33:37.109 --> 01:33:37.119 align:start position:0%
go back to our normal Trends um of
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
around 0 to 3% loss year-over year um
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
with fiscal year 23 being a little bit
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
deeper um losses people continue to uh
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
quit smoking happy to answer any
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
questions one comment and that is if
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts decides to sell menthol
 
01:33:59.199 --> 01:34:00.390 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts decides to sell menthol
cigarettes

01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
again that - 3% and uh
 
01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
fy22 could possibly put out a minus 6 or
 
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
more that's a very good point
 
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:13.310 align:start position:0%
more that's a very good point

major

01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
normally you would go see year toe use
 
01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.870 align:start position:0%
normally you would go see year toe use
of

01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
tobacco constantly decreases maybe on
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
the average of 3% and I see that you're
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
low you took that
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
tax say none we can go into the
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
interest or you see you've already done
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
23 so we'll go to interest and dividends
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
tax yep so for interest and dividends
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.199 --> 01:35:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
123.6mi

01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
123.6mi
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
so our low is 4% um 4% each month below
 
01:35:15.070 --> 01:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
plan bringing us to um a 7% ahead of
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
plan at the end of the fiscal year I
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
want to note with interest in dividends
 
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
tax um a couple of things one 75% of the
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue comes in the second half of the
 
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year this is very different than
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
the other taxes um we just saw the last
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter estimate payment come in
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
so we have information on that um which
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
adjusted are high so when we did this
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
presentation again it was before we had
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
that fourth quarter estimate payment um
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.639 --> 01:35:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
127.85

01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
35.5 um that high of
 
01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
135.5 is putting us to uh 10% ahead of
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
plan for the rest of the months uh which
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
is an average of the estimate months
 
01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
that we have received so far it's around
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
11% and we thought it's not outside the
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
realm this tax has been performing ahead
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
of plan even though at at that point
 
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
we'd only received 25% of the revenue
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
that it could continue so we wanted to
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
123.6mi % and FY
 
01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
22 yeah you'd y that that would change
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
your 22 number also change would also
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
change representative major I have a
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
question representative Ames um okay
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
ra represent and Then followed by
 
01:37:18.239 --> 01:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
ra represent and Then followed by
represent

01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
AES uh thank you Mr chairman just real
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
quick from Melissa this 10% uh increase
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
in estimates is that in any way in
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
relation to uh what may or may not be
 
01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
coming in uh with the
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
PPP loans being
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
taxed so interest in dividends um won't
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
be affected by the PPP
 
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
loans thank you m
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah uh first uh it's sort of
 
01:37:54.589 --> 01:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
two-part I'll just say say what I'm
 
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
wondering about uh first is whether you
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
have a breakdown between interest
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
dividends and
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
distributions and the second observation
 
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
I guess is that uh my sense is that U
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
dividends and
 
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
distributions are trending high and that
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
interest is not so um and that uh that
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
Trend that high level for dividends and
 
01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
distributions is uh is particularly
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive I think in the future to uh uh
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
changes in the economy that may or may
 
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
not happen and so I wonder if uh in
 
01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.189 align:start position:0%
not happen and so I wonder if uh in
looking

01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
forward you've um what you've done about
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
those uncertainties how you've
 
01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.070 align:start position:0%
those uncertainties how you've
considered

01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
them so for your first question um we
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the breakdowns for the recent
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
the 2020 information however as as I'm
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
scrolling through here from our
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
for here it is the breakdowns for tax
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
year 18 this is the latest information
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
but we can get them for tax year 19 as
 
01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:09.629 align:start position:0%
but we can get them for tax year 19 as
well

01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
um distributions and dividends made up
 
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
the bulk of this tax so if you combine
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
those you're about 80% of the interest
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax is made up of
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
distributions and dividends and then
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
133% is in interest and in a small
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
portion of around 8% as federal federal
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
tax exempt
 
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
interest um interest in dividends tax is
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit harder to predict uh year
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
over-year how we got to to these ranges
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
as we just looked at um past performance
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the taxes um and if you looked at
 
01:39:48.669 --> 01:39:48.679 align:start position:0%
them fiscal year 19 over fiscal year 18
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
was about a 7.4% growth and then fiscal
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
year 20 over fiscal year
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
um 18 was three and a half%
 
01:40:00.310 --> 01:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
growth and then we anticipate um you
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
know some growth this year I think
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends will be with our
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
ranges with the anomalous receivable
 
01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:09.639 align:start position:0%
removed somewhere between seven and
 
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
16% so we think that that growth
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
um the growth will taper off some in 22
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
and then taper off more in 23 as we've
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
seen in past performances um I think
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
partly we're interested in seeing if
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
some of those dividends and
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
distributions growth that you spoke of
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
has to do with some of the repatriated
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
funds flowing down um to businesses in
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 I mean excuse me to
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
individuals in 20 in 21 and that that
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
may the growth might continue but not as
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
strong as we were seeing um in in 21 and
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
then decreasing down to to 23 but again
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
observation the H the presentation done
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
by the Dr on the 26th of
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
January has most of these percentages in
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
there um like on page 35 of the of their
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
presentation on the 26 it'll give you
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of the interest part
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
dividends distribution and other this so
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
document represent Aly has a
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you on the trouble
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
is 18 was the year that that they were
 
01:41:44.679 --> 01:41:46.310 align:start position:0%
is 18 was the year that that they were
repatriating

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
repatriating
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
money if that comes into this tax which
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
I hadn't thought of it did but maybe it
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
does yeah I I think you're right for
 
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
business taxes that the funds were
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
repatriated but the distributions being
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
made may have taken place
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
um further
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
21 any further questions on interest and
 
01:42:22.159 --> 01:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
21 any further questions on interest and
dividends

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
then let's move on to Communication
 
01:42:26.159 --> 01:42:27.310 align:start position:0%
then let's move on to Communication

Service
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
tax okay so for CST we normally just
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
give a number this this tax doesn't vary
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
all that much
 
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
um we have 38.4 million we we'll keep
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
updating that I think if you you pick a
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
number somewhere between you know 37 38
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
to 40 you're going to fall within the
 
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
range with the the the numbers that just
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
came in for January our new estimate
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
would be 38.8 so you can see that it
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't adjust all that much um and then
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
we have no growth on this tax for the
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
next um the next two
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
CST and on uh CST that normally has been
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
slowly deing primarily because people
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
getting rid of their
 
01:43:22.119 --> 01:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
getting rid of their
landlines

01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't see any Decline and
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
growth in
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
22 or
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
23 I think our anticipation is that any
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
reduction might be offset by the tax law
 
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
change for VoIP that occurred where we
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
gave some clarification on VoIP as well
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
as um any inclusion in taxes where
 
01:43:53.950 --> 01:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers may not be be in the tax but
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
may be required to pay the tax like
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
Zoom again I can't speak to any
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
particular taxpayers but um taxpayers
 
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
that may fall into that
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
category okay
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh very important one real estate
 
01:44:12.639 --> 01:44:13.830 align:start position:0%
uh very important one real estate
transfer

01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
tax all right real estate transfer tax
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
um we know this tax has been doing very
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
well well
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it came in really well in January
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
once the revenue Focus comes out you
 
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
will see that it performed Almost 100%
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan um it just it does keep
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
growing our
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
low for Real Estate transfer is just
 
01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
basically basing it on what prior months
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
um prior months has how excuse me how
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
prior months have performed
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
um and we basically just cut in half
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in the prior months
 
01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
reducing it from
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
25% ahead of plan down to 1% for June
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
that may be a little bit low now as
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
these revenues obviously keep performing
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
higher than what we anticipate um them
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
performing so our height however is
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
essentially repeating what we saw
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
December November October and September
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
and Sor of flipping that to seeing the
 
01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
reverse amount um for the remaining
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
parts of this year so February coming in
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
at 50% and then slowly reducing it um
 
01:45:36.669 --> 01:45:36.679 align:start position:0%
based on prior year or excuse me the
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
prior half Trends down to um 133% ahead
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
of plan in May and then 2% ahead with
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
June the thought for this is that we're
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
not sure how high this can go because of
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
the inventory um demand so we have the
 
01:45:58.189 --> 01:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
inventory is low which pushes prices
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
High however how high can those prices
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
go is the question that we've been
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
asking um before they just won't go any
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
further and the demand won't be out
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
there I think there was some pent up
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
demand during covid um like I said Home
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
Improvements H projects happened people
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
got houses out in the market um which
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted our our um our percentages up I
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
I think every time we come in our
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
numbers keep getting a little bit higher
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
and higher so what I did want to note
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
for January though although that I said
 
01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
it was 100% PL ahead of plan there was
 
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
some anomalous holding company activity
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
that activity is reported separate from
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
the counties so it was I want to say
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
artificially inflated or um it's
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
inflated and not expected to continue at
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
that rate um we probably saw it more
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
around six % ahead of plan without that
 
01:46:57.589 --> 01:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
holding company activity in there so
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
we're going from around 60% ahead of
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
plan for January without that holding
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
company activity in there reducing it
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
down to
 
01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
50% for the high for February or 25% on
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
the low end for February for the coming
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
months and then we have some reductions
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 of -7% to 5% and then 8%
 
01:47:23.679 --> 01:47:25.270 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23 of -7% to 5% and then 8%
to

01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
-6% um we've been trying to watch this
 
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
and read as many articles as we can it's
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
definitely a hard tax to predict just
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
because of what we've seen with recent
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
activity um what I think is we're
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
thinking is that we're going to get back
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
to where we were um in 22 and 23 prior
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
to 21 um with a little bit more loss in
 
01:47:48.910 --> 01:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
23 we're having a hard time thinking
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
that the continued gain that we've seen
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
in 21 will continue for 22 and 23 just
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
based on um if mortgage rates increase
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
or if that inventory goes too low as
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
people you know are coming from
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
um cities and moving into these more
 
01:48:07.119 --> 01:48:09.510 align:start position:0%
um cities and moving into these more

El thank you is there anything out there
 
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
that is estimating how much of uh
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
what is being bought is being bought um
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
by people who are working somewhere else
 
01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:32.750 align:start position:0%

somewhere else after the the uh covid
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
danger is over because once that happens
 
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
or if that happens our Market is going
 
01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:49.430 align:start position:0%
or if that happens our Market is going
to

to
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
Crater sure I did read an article and I
 
01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
will send you over the link um I'm
 
01:48:58.589 --> 01:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
forgetting where it came from off the
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
top of my head but it did give a
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
percentage of how much of the home sales
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
were coming from at estate buyers um
 
01:49:08.109 --> 01:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
versus instate
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
estate okay the utility property tax all
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
right so the utility property tax we
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
have um a flat number again I think if
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
you estimate anywhere between you know
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
40 and 45 million you'll probably hit it
 
01:49:40.589 --> 01:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
right on the head we have 43.1 million
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
um January came in a little bit higher
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
than we expected so that put our new
 
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
estimate probably at 42.3 million with
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
January data again not too far off from
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
this 43 million
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
um this tax this tax we're expected to
 
01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
um end up with a decrease of 4% below
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
plan for the fiscal year and we're
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
questions does anybody have any
 
01:50:21.629 --> 01:50:21.639 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on utility propit
 
01:50:21.639 --> 01:50:23.390 align:start position:0%

01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%

all
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
right any questions overall from anybody
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee represent major this is Chris
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
can I ask Melissa a couple quick
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
questions just on her numbers
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
yes Melissa going back to interest and
 
01:50:49.790 --> 01:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
dividends for 21 you said the range
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:50:51.639 --> 01:50:53.470 align:start position:0%
would be
123.6mi

01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
123.6mi
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
135.5 yes that's correct okay and then
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
for the CST if you were to give us a
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
number it would have been 38.8 based on
 
01:51:04.430 --> 01:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
what just occurred last month yep and
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
then for the utility property tax I
 
01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
didn't hear what you said I apologize uh
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
42.3 42.3 yes and sorry we just got
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
those numbers yesterday Chris so yep no
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
understood and and and just for the me
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um you should
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
see a revenue Focus probably tomorrow or
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
the next day it should be emailed to you
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
and you would see some of these
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
percentages that are um being talked
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
about comparisons of previous year
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
month-to Monon type of things um if you
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't get the revenue Focus please email
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
me let me know you didn't get it um if
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have anything by
 
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
Thursday that way we can just make sure
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
that they didn't drop you from the
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
mailing list um but it is a good tool to
 
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
if not we thank you Melissa and Devon U
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative major there are two of US
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
Representative spillsbury has his hand
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
up and oh okay I didn't see that
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is a question
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
about the methodology I'm sure this is
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
well established and been this template
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
this approach has been used for years
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
but maybe you can help explain
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
fy22 your range essentially represents a
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
pessimistic versus an optimistic
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
scenario understandable driven by
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
escalation and then when you move to FY
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
23 it seems that
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the spread in those two scenarios
 
01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
gets compounded
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.229 --> 01:53:04.239 align:start position:0%
applying a pessimistic p2's pessimistic
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
figure and then in the upside on the
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
high range you're adding a higher
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
percentage optimistic for
 
01:53:15.709 --> 01:53:15.719 align:start position:0%
23 onto the higher
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
number in
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
fy22 so
 
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.229 align:start position:0%
fy22 so
23

01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:53:27.149 --> 01:53:27.159 align:start position:0%
on the high side is compounding the high
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
side of 22 if you look at the range in
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
dollar figures there's a much narrower
 
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
range between low and high forecasted in
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
fy22 the range becomes much greater or
 
01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
Amplified in 23 that maybe that can be
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
explained by the notion that there's
 
01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:46.189 align:start position:0%
explained by the notion that there's
greater

01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
greater
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
uncertainty the further you look out in
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
time but it strikes me that it's
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
primarily driven
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
by a methodological approach that may be
 
01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
out I respond to that Melissa sure so
 
01:54:10.990 --> 01:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's a a great question um and I just
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
want to say I think it's laid out like
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
this um just for the um committee
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
benefit so the way Dr would look at it
 
01:54:22.350 --> 01:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
when we're doing our Reven Revenue
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
estimates is we are not looking at the
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
revenue numbers for 22 and 23 we start
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
with our fiscal year 21 base and then we
 
01:54:34.510 --> 01:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
pick where we think the growth is going
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
to fall for 22 or 23 based on our fiscal
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
year 21 um number we're not doing a low
 
01:54:44.189 --> 01:54:44.199 align:start position:0%
to low and a high to high I think that's
 
01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
visually just um giving a range um it is
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
compounding it I do agree and then when
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
we look at 22 we now would have our base
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
for 22 and we would decide what growth
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
we would apply somewhere between 4 to 6%
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
based on our our 22
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
clarify yes so if I'm understanding your
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
explanation Melissa you're saying that
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
you're not using the
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
percentages as the driver for your
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
projection you've got inde dependent
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
information that's giving you a figure
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
and then you're just telling us what it
 
01:55:30.069 --> 01:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
translates to in percentage terms I
 
01:55:32.870 --> 01:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
think the opposite sorry if I misspoke
 
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
we are using the percentage to determine
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
our growth off of fiscal year 21 so
 
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 we would pick a number um
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
based on where we think it will land um
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in between that range and then
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
we would grow that fiscal year 21
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimate by 8 to a if for meals
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
and rentals for instance by 8 to
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
11% um depending on where we think 22
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
will grow so if we thought 22 was was
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
going to grow at 10% we'd pick our
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 number where we think
 
01:56:04.589 --> 01:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to land and then we say
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a 10% growth on
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is um for fiscal
 
01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:13.719 align:start position:0%
year 21 we'd have that number for fiscal
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
year 22 now that we pick to that growth
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
and then we'd we'd say okay now for
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
23 it's going to grow somewhere between
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
four and 6% looking at economic factors
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
looking at where we're at where do we
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
think it would fall would the growth be
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
between four to 6% so we're really
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the growth ranges and not the
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so rep of major if I could
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
just com here as well so repent of uh
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
spillsbury typically the the ranges are
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
provided to give the committee an idea
 
01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
of where do you want to focus your
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
attention you may end up picking a
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
number number between we'll use the
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
meals and Rental a number between 294.50
 
01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
and 312.50 that is your base number and
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
then you may make assumptions on what
 
01:57:04.750 --> 01:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
you believe the growth would be in the
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
out years so you may say you believe
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
it's only going to grow 9% and that's
 
01:57:11.709 --> 01:57:11.719 align:start position:0%
what you would apply or you might say
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
the range is nine to 10 so that that
 
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
you'd have a high low but this is just a
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
to give the committee a sense of where
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
to start looking as you try to do your
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
estimates um you could go outside these
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
numbers as well if there's re valid
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
reasons to do so so the Dr has just
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
provided an opportunity to kind of look
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
at a range but it's up to the committee
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
to pick what you want to use as a base
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
and how you want to grow that or not
 
01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:42.990 align:start position:0%
and how you want to grow that or not
grow

01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
it are you all set represent sksb yes
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the answers um I
 
01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
think I need to absorb this as we go on
 
01:57:56.350 --> 01:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
to really satisfy my question will take
 
01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:57.990 align:start position:0%
to really satisfy my question will take
a

01:57:57.990 --> 01:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
while um represent Aly thank you
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative Spiller I think you're
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
going to get the hang of it as we go
 
01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:10.679 align:start position:0%
forward we argue 21 numbers then we
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
argue 22
 
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
growth and then we apply that to the
 
01:58:20.229 --> 01:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
number we got so and I I had just a
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
quick question about the communication
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
Services text again do you have a number
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
for on how much of that growth you just
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
saw is due to your going after the zoom
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
like things of which there are
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
apparently many I only know teams in and
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
zoom on and I I I think you've been
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
going after Skype for some time though
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
haven't you I don't consider that in the
 
01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
same category but they are I mean
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're huge right now so I wondered if
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
that's why why um that number went up or
 
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
didn't go down in fact um actually it
 
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with either of those
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
the number went up because um some
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
payments that were supposed to be made
 
01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
in December uh December fell further
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
below plan than anticipated and that was
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
because payments that were supposed to
 
01:59:20.709 --> 01:59:20.719 align:start position:0%
be made in December were delayed and
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
Dr okay well thank you Melissa and
 
01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
Devon thank you
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
education we have our work cut out for
 
01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves okay we have a little bit of
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
time um there was one issue that was
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
brought up and that is relative to House
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 346 which we'll be hearing later
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
on and it doesn't didn't have a fiscal
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
note in
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
it but uh Susan did get a fiscal
 
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
analysis done so what we need to do is
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
take a vote of the committee to have the
 
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
LBA do a fiscal note so a fiscal note
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
would be part of the regular record and
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
the uh public could have access to this
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
when they looked the bill up right now
 
02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:31.550 align:start position:0%
when they looked the bill up right now
all

02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
we it's only us that'll have access to
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
this fiscal
 
02:00:36.400 --> 02:00:38.790 align:start position:0%
this fiscal
analysis

02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative elme had
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
done so what I'd like to do is to and
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
the only way we can get the Dr to do a
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note now is to take a vote and
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
have the majority the committee agreed
 
02:00:53.599 --> 02:00:54.589 align:start position:0%
have the majority the committee agreed
to

02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:57.629 --> 02:00:57.639 align:start position:0%
that because the since we are in the
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
regular legislative
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
process that's what the rules are so I
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is take a
 
02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:09.750 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is take a
vote

02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
support represent want to say
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
something one of us
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
sorry on well it's representative Aly on
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
I just just wanted to correct one thing
 
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
I didn't have the I asked for the fiscal
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
note but it was done by the agency and
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
transmitted to Chris Jay and then
 
02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
transmitted back to
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
me so I haven't even read it yet I
 
02:01:40.350 --> 02:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have
 
02:01:43.109 --> 02:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
time right it just came in I believe
 
02:01:43.119 --> 02:01:44.470 align:start position:0%
time right it just came in I believe
yesterday

02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%

02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
Chris Chris Shay yep I so I just wanted
 
02:04:47.669 --> 02:04:47.679 align:start position:0%
to explain to the committee why why you
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
had to vote and why there wasn't a
 
02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um first off the the fiscal
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
note process is the LSR is submitted by
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
a prime sponsor for the OS to draft they
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
have first crack on whe whether a bill
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
needs a fiscal note or not and then they
 
02:05:04.990 --> 02:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
would send it to our
 
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
office during this um remote time frame
 
02:05:09.549 --> 02:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
they changed the process for how you
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
were to um request an LSR and be drafted
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
it became remote uh an electronic
 
02:05:18.270 --> 02:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
process and there was a glitch in the
 
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
system so when they flagged it for an FN
 
02:05:23.390 --> 02:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
it didn't always stay on as an FN so
 
02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
there were some bills that got
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
introduced that should have had an FN
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
and didn't get it um so at this point if
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
you if you're aware of any bill that you
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
know fits that criteria and the
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
committee now needs to um per statute
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
would need to vote um to have us do a
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and a majority is all that's
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
needed for the request um in the interim
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
what we do do is we will do what we call
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
a fiscal analysis on an amendment or a a
 
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
bill um per request of an individual so
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
in this case representative Aly um
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
requested for us to look at um House
 
02:06:02.589 --> 02:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 346 because she felt that had some
 
02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact and should be um looked at
 
02:06:06.669 --> 02:06:06.679 align:start position:0%
so we did that and provided that
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
document to her which she provided to
 
02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:09.390 align:start position:0%
document to her which she provided to
repent

02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
repent
 
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
major if you debate or discuss um House
 
02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 346 you can look at that document
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
to kind of get a sense of what the
 
02:06:20.109 --> 02:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact would be of the bill but
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
that's not an official fcal note it
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't attach to the bill it wouldn't
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
travel with the bill so what you just
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
did is required us to actually do an
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
official fiscal note that would be a
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill going forward um
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
and and be available to everybody to see
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
essentially what repent VY has is a
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
document that was prepared for her and
 
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
how she shares that was is is up to her
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
to decide um so so again I just wanted
 
02:06:44.669 --> 02:06:44.679 align:start position:0%
to let the committee know why you did
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
what you just did um and if you do um
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
encounter another bill you know that on
 
02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
your committee that you believe needs
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
note that doesn't have one this is the
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
process you would want to
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
use so I'll and I'll let our office know
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
ASAP the outside of that I just wanted
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
to um I should have mentioned earlier
 
02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
but you should all be receiving in the
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
mail a packet from our office I don't
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
know if some of you may have already
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
gotten it but it's going to have the
 
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
caffer a hard copy of the caffer a hard
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
copy of the offering statement and and
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
then um the presentation that I provided
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
you uh you the other day that I did um
 
02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
so those documents were some that people
 
02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
were talking about is good resources
 
02:07:33.069 --> 02:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
particularly the offering statement and
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
the um caffer um you know if you go into
 
02:07:37.119 --> 02:07:38.709 align:start position:0%
the um caffer um you know if you go into
Pages

02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
Pages
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
146 I think like beginning on 146 of the
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
caffer you'll find um historical
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
information on your revenues you have
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
general fund education trust fund
 
02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
Highway and fishing game funds um so you
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
can kind of see some of the trends that
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
have occurred with those revenues over a
 
02:07:56.549 --> 02:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
10-year period which may be helpful as
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about um the volatility
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with right now also for
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
the new members um over the summer the
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee did quite a bit
 
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
of work on trying to um determine what
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
covid what the impact of covid was on
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
the revenues and um how 21 might end and
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
what issues were being dealt with a lot
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
of that information is still on our
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
website um you may want to take a look
 
02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
at that as you're trying to understand
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
potentially what could happen going
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
forward if if some of these variants uh
 
02:08:30.589 --> 02:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
you know do Bloom and and become an
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
issue for for the businesses and others
 
02:08:35.990 --> 02:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
but again it's a resource um that you
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
can go back and look at um if you
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
weren't on the committee at the time
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
that they that they were being
 
02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
discussed um trying to think if there's
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
anything else I can point you at at the
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
moment but feel free if you have
 
02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
questions to email myself um happy to
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
try to search things down for you or or
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
advise if if I can um again today and
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow are meant to help you educate
 
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
yourselves on the types of revenues you
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
have to look at and why the numbers are
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
what they are that the agency's provided
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
so it's all I have thank
 
02:09:15.870 --> 02:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
you okay um our next session is at
 
02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
11:30 so representative major yes could
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
I take a very small amount of that time
 
02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
first I had my hand
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
up sure thank you um well first I wanted
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
to really thank Chris Jay and I think
 
02:09:35.669 --> 02:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
that I'm at the end of the post office
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
Pipeline and I got it on Friday Saturday
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
I forget um that packet could and could
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
you provide link a link to the co
 
02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
discussions this summer for the
 
02:09:50.069 --> 02:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
committee so that they'll know where to
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
find it
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I can rep me if if anybody's accessed
 
02:09:58.750 --> 02:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
our website for the um discussions last
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
week you're going to see revenues and
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see 22 23 and then um 2021 if you
 
02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
go into the 2021 revenues all the
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
documents are in there and I can put my
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
screen up if you want me to walk you
 
02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:13.310 align:start position:0%
screen up if you want me to walk you
through

02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
it can I ask my other question first
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
because it's something else that you
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out there is one other bill that
 
02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
on is very complicated about needing a
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note hb12 combined worldwide
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
reporting The Way It Was Written it on
 
02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
as it says that we need to shift to
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting which is
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
another version of uh uh
 
02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
apportionment uh in the business taxes
 
02:10:49.149 --> 02:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
and on and to set up a study committee
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
to consider effects
 
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
and on I believe that the sponsor who is
 
02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
with us here representative shamberg
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
knows that um it's not completely ready
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
for prime time yet and because of that
 
02:11:09.549 --> 02:11:09.559 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very difficult for for
 
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
the uh Dr to do a fiscal
 
02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
note at this point and but it does it
 
02:11:20.109 --> 02:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
would need a fiscal note if they'd been
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
paying attention or it hadn't fallen off
 
02:11:23.159 --> 02:11:24.470 align:start position:0%
paying attention or it hadn't fallen off
the

02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:26.229 align:start position:0%
the
digital

02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
digital
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
record so I'm not sure what gets done
 
02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
with that thank you we'll deal with that
 
02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
when the bill comes before us and I I
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
forgot what what day I have scheduled it
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
for it comes up February
 
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
17th it's the yeah it's the last one but
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
it would definitely need considerable
 
02:11:54.270 --> 02:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.589 --> 02:11:58.599 align:start position:0%
okay as I was saying we have U 17
 
02:12:03.549 --> 02:12:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
the people from HHS comes up come in so
 
02:12:10.709 --> 02:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
why don't we take a break
 
02:12:13.950 --> 02:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
until ripson major Ripon Tucker has her
 
02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
until ripson major Ripon Tucker has her
hand

02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
hand
 
02:12:19.470 --> 02:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
up repres ined Tucker yes
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh the whole time topic of
 
02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
covid-19 even without variant is one
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
that is going to have such a big effect
 
02:12:34.549 --> 02:12:34.559 align:start position:0%
on revenues I really think we need to be
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
zeroing in
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
on when it's likely that we'll have a
 
02:12:48.510 --> 02:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
70% herd immunity in New Hampshire and
 
02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:50.109 align:start position:0%
70% herd immunity in New Hampshire and
the

02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
uh giving out of shots has been so
 
02:12:54.079 --> 02:12:55.069 align:start position:0%
uh giving out of shots has been so
difficult

02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
with so few vials coming into the
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
state and some kind of confusion between
 
02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
the federal approach and the state
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
approach that I am very concerned that
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
we're not really going to be ready for a
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
summer tourist season and that summer
 
02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
tourist season not only affects the
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
North country but all of New Hampshire
 
02:13:26.189 --> 02:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
since tourism is such a big part of our
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
economy I don't know who would be the
 
02:13:34.990 --> 02:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
best person to find out uh what the
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
likelihood of really being open for
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
business this
 
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
summer but I think we need to be asking
 
02:13:47.549 --> 02:13:47.559 align:start position:0%
that it may be the reopening committee
 
02:13:50.149 --> 02:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
it may be someone at Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
it may be health and Human Services or
 
02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three of those but we need
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
to get in order to do a proper job of
 
02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:02.559 align:start position:0%
revenues I really think we need to focus
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
in on this topic it's it goes through so
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
many of the uh revenues that it's it's
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
key you make a very good point and and
 
02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
we'll make uh room to invite early
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
people could help uh explain what they
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
think is going to happen relative to the
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine and
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.629 --> 02:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
you we'll certainly do
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
that um anything else before we take a a
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
break if we have time for a break D wz I
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
just got
 
02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
back I guess I missed everything why
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
don't we take a break
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
until 5 minutes
 
02:15:02.430 --> 02:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
1125 that that'll make us ready for the
 
02:15:07.199 --> 02:15:08.790 align:start position:0%
1125 that that'll make us ready for the
1130

02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
1130
 
02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:20.589 --> 02:15:20.599 align:start position:0%
11:25 so don't go away just mute
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%

02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman could I ask you a question
 
02:25:34.990 --> 02:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
yes I I was thinking about what
 
02:25:37.070 --> 02:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker had
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh and I wholeheartedly agree
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think there's going to be significant
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
Co impact especially through the summer
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
and fall months when we have a busy
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
tourist season and you asking about who
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
might be um willing to address the
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee to get a sense which I suspect
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
will be I don't know is what they're
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
going to say we don't know exactly but
 
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
be cautious about predictions and a
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
suggestion that I would have there's a
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
few people out there that I think would
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
have a lot of credibility to present uh
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
Dr Ben Chan uh who presented to finance
 
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
but the other two that are also you know
 
02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
potential people as Dr Jose uh
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
Marcato epidemiologist in conquer and
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
also Dr um Elizabeth Talbot who lives up
 
02:26:30.389 --> 02:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
in New London but she did a lot of work
 
02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
with the Ebola virus and all the
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
epidemiological stuff so what I'm saying
 
02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
is that these could be three very very
 
02:26:40.830 --> 02:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
powerful uh resources to give us a sense
 
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
about where we're going with vaccine uh
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination in the state and what their
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
predictions might be though their
 
02:26:49.389 --> 02:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
predictions will be guarded in the sense
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
that they don't really know but they
 
02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
will be able to say that to us can you
 
02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
send me an email I will thank you I'll
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
give you the three names but each one of
 
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
them is an epidemiologist with a lot of
 
02:27:03.630 --> 02:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
experience and I think they would be
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
very helpful to present even for a half
 
02:27:09.309 --> 02:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
an hour with the committee okay thanks
 
02:27:09.319 --> 02:27:14.710 align:start position:0%
an hour with the committee okay thanks
you're

02:27:14.710 --> 02:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
welcome and thank you for me too oh
 
02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:19.150 align:start position:0%
welcome and thank you for me too oh
you're

02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:21.510 align:start position:0%
you're
welcome

02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
02:27:23.870 --> 02:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
I think you're absolutely right you know
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
about what um the impacts will be going
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
forward in the The psychosis that people
 
02:27:32.190 --> 02:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
are going to carry forward as uh the
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
chairman mentioned even flying too so
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
while

02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
while
 
02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:41.710 align:start position:0%
while
unfortunately

02:27:41.710 --> 02:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:27:43.830 --> 02:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but but I think that's a
 
02:27:47.630 --> 02:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
different question than the
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
actual herd immunity which we
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
need to reach in order to loosen the
 
02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions and
 
02:27:58.830 --> 02:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
regulations yes and when you were saying
 
02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
that before I was thinking about how you
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned New Hampshire her immunity
 
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
but I think most of the epidemiologist
 
02:28:08.269 --> 02:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
you know will tell you that this is a
 
02:28:12.429 --> 02:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
worldwide her immunity that we need yes
 
02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
just our tourist season doesn't have
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
to take that into account as much okay
 
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:23.429 align:start position:0%
to take that into account as much okay
Chris

02:28:23.429 --> 02:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
yes do we have uh Karen rounds ready yep
 
02:28:29.950 --> 02:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
um Brad can just bring her into the
 
02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
meeting and um she's with with you now
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay needs to unmute herself and she'll
 
02:28:37.070 --> 02:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
talk okay uh Karen rounds is the Chief
 
02:28:42.309 --> 02:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer of the Department of
 
02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
Services and she's going to be here to
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
talk about the Medicaid
 
02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:51.590 align:start position:0%
talk about the Medicaid
recoveries

02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
recoveries
 
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
R major I'll share my screen just so you
 
02:28:56.590 --> 02:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
can see the um Medicaid recoveries
 
02:29:00.190 --> 02:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
column okay and then if you need me to
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
shut it off just shout at me and I'll
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
take it down all
 
02:29:07.630 --> 02:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
right good morning Representatives um
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
Chris has Meredith joined us I really
 
02:29:14.349 --> 02:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
need her to be um online to talk through
 
02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
most of this I I hadn't seen her just
 
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
yet but
 
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I know she is joining so if we can
 
02:29:24.190 --> 02:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
wait just a moment for her I think this
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
will be much more efficient with her
 
02:29:26.479 --> 02:29:31.110 align:start position:0%
will be much more efficient with her
joining

02:29:31.110 --> 02:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
us she's with us now Karen well we're
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
waiting uh do you have any
 
02:29:40.349 --> 02:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations on who the committee can
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
talk with to get a better idea of
 
02:29:50.190 --> 02:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh where covid-19 is going and when
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
to get out of
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
it so I believe um there was a request
 
02:30:02.670 --> 02:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
that I think it did come from your
 
02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
committee maybe Chris could uh remind me
 
02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
for sure to Ben Chan to come present and
 
02:30:11.710 --> 02:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
I believe that there was a larger
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
hearing being set up to include more
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
than just Ways and Means because um Ben
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine or Dr Chan as you can
 
02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
imagine is quite busy so we want to make
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
sure to uh be efficient with his time so
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
Chris do you recall if that was being
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
set up I don't know if the larger
 
02:30:31.269 --> 02:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
meeting with um Dr Chan was being set up
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not involved with that but
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
you did have um director daily is that
 
02:30:37.910 --> 02:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
correct I think she came and spoke the
 
02:30:40.349 --> 02:30:40.359 align:start position:0%
ways and means just to give you a sense
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
of how the um vaccines were being rolled
 
02:30:45.389 --> 02:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
out but I'm not sure what's happening
 
02:30:47.910 --> 02:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
with a larger meeting um with Dr Chan
 
02:30:49.269 --> 02:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
and any others at this point I'll have
 
02:30:50.670 --> 02:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
to look into that
 
02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay John Williams is probably the best
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
contact for that I think he was helping
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
lead that okay thank
 
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:03.240 align:start position:0%
you on he there was a a meeting that I
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
don't think was terribly well advertised
 
02:31:08.110 --> 02:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
but that was uh we a number of us were
 
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
sent information on with the health and
 
02:31:14.670 --> 02:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
human services
 
02:31:18.150 --> 02:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
committee but it was extremely related
 
02:31:21.550 --> 02:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
to their issues
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
but they did spend quite a lot of time
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
in that meeting I don't know if that's
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
what you were referring to it was
 
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
Friday I sat in on it listen to it that
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
might have been the meeting that was set
 
02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
up I'm not it was several
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
hours not just do Dr Chan but others as
 
02:31:45.230 --> 02:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
well Chris what are what are the columns
 
02:31:46.670 --> 02:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
all the way to the left I'm assuming
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
those are labels for each of the fiscal
 
02:31:51.870 --> 02:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
years on Medicaid
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
so start so row eight or one depending
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
how you look at it would be fiscal year
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:18.070 --> 02:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:20.830 --> 02:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
23 there's a p afraid to try to do
 
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
anything to the the document because I'm
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
not sure if I'll lose the image on on
 
02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
the on the
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
screen understood maybe if you zoom out
 
02:32:33.150 --> 02:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
a smidge then we can see those leftand
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
columns I'm not sure um but I'll go
 
02:32:37.670 --> 02:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
ahead and just turn it over to Meredith
 
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
and and let her
 
02:32:41.429 --> 02:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
um speak
 
02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
to the Medicaid
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
recoveries good morning
 
02:32:49.269 --> 02:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
everyone uh Meredith tus from the
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of the division of
 
02:32:55.710 --> 02:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
program quality and integrity uh and
 
02:32:57.550 --> 02:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I can walk you through a little bit
 
02:32:59.309 --> 02:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
of what you're seeing here for the
 
02:32:59.319 --> 02:33:00.670 align:start position:0%
of what you're seeing here for the
Medicaid

02:33:00.670 --> 02:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
02:33:05.550 --> 02:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
recoveries areas um you'll see that the
 
02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
estimates are going down year-over-year
 
02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh much more slightly between 22 and
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
23 and you may recall when we presented
 
02:33:19.950 --> 02:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
last week that they had his historic
 
02:33:22.269 --> 02:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
historically um for these two years
 
02:33:25.950 --> 02:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
which I think was around 201 17ish um 16
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
17 they had been very high like in the
 
02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
$9 million range um that was because at
 
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
the time the department um had been
 
02:33:41.830 --> 02:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
awaiting cost settlements to happen uh
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
with hospitals for their Medicare audits
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
to be completed and those had gotten
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
backed up for a long time period
 
02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
um and and then finally kind of were
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
were many audits were completed and so
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a flood of cost
 
02:33:58.670 --> 02:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
settlements occurring and so we had this
 
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
influx of Revenue over a couple of years
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
um that is now completed and the cost
 
02:34:08.429 --> 02:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
settlements are much more standardized
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
and the timing of them is um ongoing so
 
02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
we're really up toate on getting those
 
02:34:17.469 --> 02:34:17.479 align:start position:0%
cost settlements done for our outpatient
 
02:34:20.670 --> 02:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
payments to hospitals so we don't really
 
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate that part of Revenue
 
02:34:27.309 --> 02:34:27.319 align:start position:0%
fluctuating going forward so our our
 
02:34:30.830 --> 02:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
Medicade recoveries are made up of a few
 
02:34:33.269 --> 02:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
different areas um that I'm going to
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
categorize four ways one is those cost
 
02:34:38.150 --> 02:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
settlements which as I said kind of had
 
02:34:39.950 --> 02:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
fluctuated previously and we expect them
 
02:34:43.269 --> 02:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
to be much more standard going forward
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
one is the area of program
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
Integrity which is recoveries for
 
02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
provider or beneficiary fraud was or
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
abuse one is TPL which is third party
 
02:34:58.590 --> 02:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
liability because as you're all probably
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
aware Medicaid is the pair of Last
 
02:35:04.630 --> 02:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
Resort and then one is estate recoveries
 
02:35:06.309 --> 02:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid estate
 
02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
recoveries so um in the area of program
 
02:35:15.389 --> 02:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
Integrity which relates to provider
 
02:35:18.269 --> 02:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
um fraud waste and abuse or beneficiary
 
02:35:21.389 --> 02:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
fraud waste and abuse we've seen very
 
02:35:21.399 --> 02:35:22.990 align:start position:0%
fraud waste and abuse we've seen very
slight

02:35:22.990 --> 02:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
slight
 
02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
changes um in that there's a a a small
 
02:35:30.670 --> 02:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
increase in uh recoveries on the
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
provider side and I think that's for a
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
um one being that the the uh Attorney
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
General's office to whom we refer
 
02:35:50.190 --> 02:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud um has had had a lot less
 
02:35:52.349 --> 02:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
turnover recently and so they are kind
 
02:35:54.389 --> 02:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
of standardizing their
 
02:35:54.399 --> 02:35:56.389 align:start position:0%
of standardizing their
processes

02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
processes
 
02:35:56.399 --> 02:35:58.150 align:start position:0%
processes
um

02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:00.469 --> 02:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
however that that has been kind of a
 
02:36:02.349 --> 02:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
recent development in the last 12 months
 
02:36:02.359 --> 02:36:03.110 align:start position:0%
recent development in the last 12 months
what

02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
happened um previously is that the
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
department entered into of course
 
02:36:09.550 --> 02:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
contracts with our managed care
 
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
companies and the Managed Care
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
organizations now hold the vast majority
 
02:36:17.469 --> 02:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
of the Medicaid population for the
 
02:36:21.630 --> 02:36:21.640 align:start position:0%
department so they are are really doing
 
02:36:25.150 --> 02:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
the recoveries for waste and abuse which
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
is the bulk of the recoveries is small
 
02:36:29.309 --> 02:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
small amount of Fraud and then the
 
02:36:33.870 --> 02:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
majority is waste and abuse um and so
 
02:36:36.750 --> 02:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
the Managed Care organizations then
 
02:36:39.510 --> 02:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
retain those recoveries and we don't see
 
02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
them here now that does mean that on
 
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
that side of of the department paying
 
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
the Managed Care organizations we can
 
02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
reduce our payments to them based on
 
02:36:50.910 --> 02:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
those recoveries we know they're going
 
02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
to receive but what it means is that
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
what this committee sees in terms of
 
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues is reduced
 
02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
slightly from that from that
 
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
change um so that is recoveries from
 
02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:07.110 align:start position:0%
change um so that is recoveries from
Medicaid

02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
02:37:11.790 --> 02:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
providers recoveries from um Medicaid
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries actually at this point we
 
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
have discontinued pursuing uh recoveries
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
from beneficiaries unless there is is
 
02:37:22.110 --> 02:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
fraud in which case it's referred to law
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement we're awaiting guidance from
 
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
CMS as our all states on what they
 
02:37:31.469 --> 02:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
intend for us to do with recoveries uh
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid
 
02:37:36.510 --> 02:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries for um for overpayments
 
02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:37.590 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries for um for overpayments
medical

02:37:37.590 --> 02:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:37:41.349 --> 02:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
overpayments related to um
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries and then uh on the third
 
02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
party well I'll stop there that's
 
02:37:49.710 --> 02:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
program Integrity um and let me ask do
 
02:37:52.190 --> 02:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
people have questions on program
 
02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:56.150 align:start position:0%
people have questions on program
Integrity

02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:58.590 --> 02:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
recoveries representative major you're
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
you're there there we go before we get
 
02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
into that would you give us some idea
 
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
what the
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the Medicaid payments
 
02:38:21.630 --> 02:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
all Medicaid payments or Medicaid
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
payments to the Managed Care
 
02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:27.070 align:start position:0%
payments to the Managed Care
organizations

02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
or what's here all Medicaid
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
payments um I think Karen will know
 
02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
better but I believe it's around two
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
billion or a little over two billion
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere in that range it's like
 
02:38:44.269 --> 02:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
1.6 to two depending on uh many factors
 
02:38:47.230 --> 02:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
in one year or two years that's a
 
02:38:50.469 --> 02:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
year okay that's all Medicaid programs
 
02:38:54.870 --> 02:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
too so that's like croch share and uh
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
the DD system and long-term care that
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's everything and then the relation
 
02:39:05.389 --> 02:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.389 --> 02:39:10.399 align:start position:0%
recoveries from that amount or what
 
02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
amount would they recover from what what
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
group R is so the recovery that we would
 
02:39:24.150 --> 02:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
be engaged in would be for primarily
 
02:39:27.469 --> 02:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid providers where we
 
02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
see fraud or waste or
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
abuse or other types of overpayments so
 
02:39:37.590 --> 02:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
on medic providers how much money is
 
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
providers how much money is paid out to
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:51.550 --> 02:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
asking uh it is the the same amount as
 
02:39:54.030 --> 02:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
what Karen is saying but it's made in
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
different forms so some of the payments
 
02:40:00.269 --> 02:40:00.279 align:start position:0%
that we make are fee for service
 
02:40:00.279 --> 02:40:02.110 align:start position:0%
that we make are fee for service
based

02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
based
 
02:40:04.269 --> 02:40:04.279 align:start position:0%
um because we still have a fee for
 
02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
service population some of them are fee
 
02:40:11.790 --> 02:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
for service on the long-term care side
 
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then I want to say
 
02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
around um uh around 1 billion Karen goes
 
02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
organizations and I think um is that
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
does that sound right about a billion
 
02:40:29.309 --> 02:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that sounds about right I mean I
 
02:40:32.230 --> 02:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
I'd want to confirm to but something
 
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
around that it's something like a
 
02:40:35.230 --> 02:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
billion goes to the Managed Care
 
02:40:37.550 --> 02:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
organizations and then we have kind of
 
02:40:40.510 --> 02:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
what I'll call Bulk payments um of
 
02:40:45.030 --> 02:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
around you know 250 million-ish in Dish
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
and then Pro
 
02:40:48.990 --> 02:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
share um so they're not so the payments
 
02:40:50.910 --> 02:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
are not always made from the Department
 
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
directly to Providers as a fee for
 
02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:54.230 align:start position:0%
directly to Providers as a fee for
service

02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:40:58.030 --> 02:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
payment so what I'm trying to get at is
 
02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
the $3.7 million in
 
02:41:06.070 --> 02:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
to what's the part of money that were
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
paid out by medic
 
02:41:17.389 --> 02:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
Cade that they look for recoveries for I
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
believe our feif for service
 
02:41:23.429 --> 02:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
payments um I would need to check on
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
that number I just don't have it off the
 
02:41:28.269 --> 02:41:28.279 align:start position:0%
top of my head like is it a half a
 
02:41:31.389 --> 02:41:31.399 align:start position:0%
billion dollars worth of
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
payments a billion or a tenth of a
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
billion if we include long-term care I
 
02:41:40.429 --> 02:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
think our long-term care payments total
 
02:41:44.670 --> 02:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
million yeah if you include the CFI
 
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
waiver it's like 370 I think
 
02:41:55.790 --> 02:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
370 what do you what are you trying to
 
02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
does the 3.7 million represent
 
02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:15.750 --> 02:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
out we would have to we would have to
 
02:42:20.269 --> 02:42:20.279 align:start position:0%
look at that um
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
I think representative I just want to
 
02:42:24.110 --> 02:42:24.120 align:start position:0%
make sure we're capturing the right
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
amount for
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
comparison and then can give you the
 
02:42:31.349 --> 02:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
categories let's say it's money to
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
provide is was was a100
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
million and is this recovery all from
 
02:42:44.269 --> 02:42:44.279 align:start position:0%
that $100 million that was paid out or
 
02:42:44.279 --> 02:42:46.790 align:start position:0%
that $100 million that was paid out or
what

02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:50.510 --> 02:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
else is theover recovery
 
02:42:54.910 --> 02:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
represent other than money paid out to
 
02:42:57.550 --> 02:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
Providers part of this would be
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:03.429 align:start position:0%
 
Providers

02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
Providers
 
02:43:08.190 --> 02:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
um hard yes yes it would be money paid
 
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
out to
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
Providers and uh and then the other
 
02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
portion of it though is estate
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
recoveries so estate recoveries for
 
02:43:18.110 --> 02:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
people who have been receiving
 
02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:23.750 align:start position:0%
people who have been receiving
Medicaid

02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
all right represent major representative
 
02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
AB bramy has had his hand
 
02:43:31.030 --> 02:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
BR sure thank you um I remember from
 
02:43:37.710 --> 02:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
years ago one example of this that fell
 
02:43:40.670 --> 02:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
into this bucket was people who who
 
02:43:44.429 --> 02:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
received uh benefits or payments uh were
 
02:43:47.469 --> 02:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
made for under Medicaid but then you
 
02:43:48.670 --> 02:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
discover that they actually had other
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
insurance ins and that you CW you clawed
 
02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
back that money from the other insurance
 
02:43:56.269 --> 02:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct and that
 
02:43:58.590 --> 02:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
is what we referred to as TPL or third
 
02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
party liability because Medicaid is the
 
02:44:02.309 --> 02:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
pair of Last Resort that's correct
 
02:44:04.110 --> 02:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
representative and what what percentage
 
02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
of of the total here are we talking is
 
02:44:07.710 --> 02:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
that a pretty big percentage of what
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
you're Co you're
 
02:44:14.830 --> 02:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
recovering it is I will try to find a an
 
02:44:20.349 --> 02:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
amount for it's a little over um
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
a half a million dollars it might be in
 
02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
the range of six to
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
700,000 right okay but on that side
 
02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
something to keep in mind is that
 
02:44:32.830 --> 02:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
similar to program Integrity when we
 
02:44:36.910 --> 02:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
moved into uh Managed Care the Managed
 
02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
Care organizations took over that
 
02:44:42.269 --> 02:44:42.279 align:start position:0%
function of TPL so they are now
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for doing TPL on their
 
02:44:46.389 --> 02:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
members they have access to the other
 
02:44:48.269 --> 02:44:48.279 align:start position:0%
insurance we provide them access to who
 
02:44:51.590 --> 02:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
has medic care and they should primarily
 
02:44:54.110 --> 02:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
be cost avoiding which means when a
 
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
claim comes in for someone who has third
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
party liability they deny it in the
 
02:44:59.910 --> 02:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
first instance so I know it's
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive but we actually don't
 
02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
want to see a ton of recoveries for TPL
 
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
because we want them to cost avoid the
 
02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
claim first um and we kind of check
 
02:45:12.670 --> 02:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
their systems to make sure that's what
 
02:45:14.990 --> 02:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing but then in addition to
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
that yes if if for some reason it wasn't
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
a ailable to them that information and
 
02:45:22.110 --> 02:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
they paid the claim then they would do
 
02:45:24.510 --> 02:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
the recovery on the back end so that
 
02:45:26.550 --> 02:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
that kind of explains that the reduction
 
02:45:28.190 --> 02:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
is that part of the explanation of why
 
02:45:29.990 --> 02:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
this number is going down over time it
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
is it is um and so actually while the
 
02:45:36.150 --> 02:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
mco's manag Care organizations have been
 
02:45:38.750 --> 02:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
doing those cost recoveries for us
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
related to medical and Pharmacy claims
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
um for some time in our contracts we
 
02:45:47.710 --> 02:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
just moved accident and Trauma subreg
 
02:45:51.269 --> 02:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
into the contracts as of last fall so
 
02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's a new area that they will be
 
02:45:55.230 --> 02:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
covering that we won't be covering and
 
02:45:56.750 --> 02:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's why we anticipate it going down a
 
02:45:58.830 --> 02:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
little further over the coming years
 
02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's great thank you y and just
 
02:46:04.389 --> 02:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
to to reiterate while we see a reduction
 
02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
here we are gaining in our contracts
 
02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
with the mcos because we force a
 
02:46:14.349 --> 02:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
side all right go ahead followup
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
question representative major this is
 
02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:21.070 align:start position:0%
question representative major this is
Dick

02:46:21.070 --> 02:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
Dick
 
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
Ames represent Ames yeah um on estate
 
02:46:27.309 --> 02:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
recoveries is that the same picture are
 
02:46:29.469 --> 02:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
the managed care companies now doing
 
02:46:33.030 --> 02:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
some of that it's not um we continue to
 
02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
do that and estate recoveries has
 
02:46:38.269 --> 02:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
actually been um doing pretty well I
 
02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the the graphs but if you
 
02:46:42.389 --> 02:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
refer to the graphs that we had provided
 
02:46:43.950 --> 02:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
from last week you'll see that one's
 
02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
been incrementally ticking up um as our
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
estate recoveries group has just really
 
02:46:52.110 --> 02:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
been doing a doing a a very good job um
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
I think they'll probably Plateau at some
 
02:46:56.469 --> 02:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
point there's only so much there but
 
02:46:59.309 --> 02:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
that has been increasing I I want to say
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's around
 
02:47:04.670 --> 02:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
1.5 million of recovery that they're at
 
02:47:07.710 --> 02:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
now thank
 
02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
you okay you can
 
02:47:14.590 --> 02:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
continue so those are actually all four
 
02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
areas of uh Medicaid recoveries it's
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
really the ACT um the thirdparty
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
liability program Integrity estate
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
recoveries and uh cost settlements so at
 
02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
this point while they continue to go
 
02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
down slightly or we anticipate them
 
02:47:34.389 --> 02:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
going down slightly it is because we
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
anticipate more action happening in the
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
Managed Care sphere and the department
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
will be like I said sa kind of
 
02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:46.110 align:start position:0%
saving um an equal amount in those
 
02:47:46.110 --> 02:47:47.830 align:start position:0%
saving um an equal amount in those

02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.870 --> 02:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
02:48:08.590 --> 02:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
representative Philips thank you Mr
 
02:48:11.950 --> 02:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
chair um miss too if you could just
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit to about the
 
02:48:17.710 --> 02:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
proportion of what portion the
 
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries are no longer being um
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
pursued in terms of by the department
 
02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
for those
 
02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
collections um related to those um
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
program Integrity concerns you just
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
spoke about you said you are continuing
 
02:48:34.349 --> 02:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
to follow the provider fraud use abuse
 
02:48:37.389 --> 02:48:37.399 align:start position:0%
and waste but uh the collections for the
 
02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries you're you're not
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
currently pursuing those and just
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
referring those to law enforcement my
 
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
concern is you know what is kind of like
 
02:48:47.309 --> 02:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
the average threshold of those
 
02:48:50.389 --> 02:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
collections that you could pursue and
 
02:48:52.830 --> 02:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
also like the bigger pie picture how big
 
02:48:54.670 --> 02:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
is that P piece of the pie that we're
 
02:48:57.870 --> 02:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
not actually tracking
 
02:49:01.230 --> 02:49:01.240 align:start position:0%
down so I can look into historically
 
02:49:04.590 --> 02:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
what those amounts were we are still
 
02:49:08.750 --> 02:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
recovering um on our on our uh member
 
02:49:11.630 --> 02:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
fraud side
 
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
um but I I think you know um recoveries
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
might be 5 to 10,000
 
02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
um uh a month so it would be it would be
 
02:49:31.269 --> 02:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
maybe up to 120,000 is a year um so
 
02:49:34.830 --> 02:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:37.790 --> 02:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
not huge numbers and part of the reason
 
02:49:39.670 --> 02:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
I think that a lot of states are in this
 
02:49:41.429 --> 02:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
position of questioning where they go
 
02:49:43.870 --> 02:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
with this is because of course we're now
 
02:49:46.349 --> 02:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
in a situation where we are paying
 
02:49:50.190 --> 02:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations premium every
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
month for certain
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
members um if a member does not utilize
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um and then we find something
 
02:50:04.510 --> 02:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
happened and they weren't discontinued
 
02:50:06.190 --> 02:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
for a few months the states are
 
02:50:09.429 --> 02:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
questioning are do we pursue that um if
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
fraud so that's really the outstanding
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
question but if you are curious what it
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
had been historically I can certainly
 
02:50:22.030 --> 02:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:24.389 --> 02:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
you okay what those recoveries had been
 
02:50:25.550 --> 02:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
kind of when we were in a feif for
 
02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:28.510 align:start position:0%
kind of when we were in a feif for
service

02:50:28.510 --> 02:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
world and Mer is so that if you have a
 
02:50:36.590 --> 02:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
total of 1.2 billion dollars in in
 
02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:39.070 align:start position:0%
total of 1.2 billion dollars in in
Medicaid

02:50:39.070 --> 02:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures we're recovering about
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
onethird of 1% due to fraud or third
 
02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
third party billing other other things
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
1% if um I think we need to look at what
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
our portion of payments directly to
 
02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
Providers is though the portion that's
 
02:51:08.550 --> 02:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
outside of the Managed Care world and
 
02:51:09.910 --> 02:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
outside of proch share payments and
 
02:51:12.750 --> 02:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
outside of dish payments and and then
 
02:51:14.790 --> 02:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
see what that total is and I I don't
 
02:51:17.750 --> 02:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
have that total in front of me um Mr
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
chair so I will try to look at what that
 
02:51:22.349 --> 02:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
total is okay so you're saying there's
 
02:51:24.830 --> 02:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
recoveries on these other
 
02:51:27.309 --> 02:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
areas those are those are separate yes
 
02:51:28.830 --> 02:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
those are separate from the recoveries
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we do in for program Integrity for
 
02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
example so when we make the dish
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
payments the recovery on that is a
 
02:51:37.389 --> 02:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
totally different mechanism that
 
02:51:38.710 --> 02:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't show up in our
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recoveries right and these
 
02:51:43.150 --> 02:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
recoveries go to the general CL all
 
02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
those all those other recoveries go to
 
02:51:50.110 --> 02:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
specific dedicated areas
 
02:51:52.030 --> 02:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
the well for dish for example those
 
02:51:54.190 --> 02:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
recoveries are redistributed among the
 
02:51:57.429 --> 02:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
hospitals okay something to keep in mind
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
too is that as Karen and I are
 
02:52:00.429 --> 02:52:00.439 align:start position:0%
discussing when we talk about
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
percentages as Karen and I are
 
02:52:04.910 --> 02:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
discussing the um payments to Providers
 
02:52:07.469 --> 02:52:07.479 align:start position:0%
those are total funds what you're seeing
 
02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
here is just the general fund portion
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's a federal fund match here that's
 
02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
also recovered but provided back to the
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh to the feds back to CMS so this is
 
02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:20.429 align:start position:0%
uh to the feds back to CMS so this is
just

02:52:20.429 --> 02:52:20.439 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:52:23.349 --> 02:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
representing half or less than half of
 
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
the total recoveries based on whatever
 
02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:40.670 --> 02:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
questions I I don't see any further
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:50.670 --> 02:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
Aly no I think the part of this elephant
 
02:52:53.349 --> 02:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
that we are seeing is getting shrinking
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
down to a less than a toenail over the
 
02:52:59.309 --> 02:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
years as as they hopefully get more
 
02:53:01.950 --> 02:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
efficient with the use with the hmos and
 
02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:04.990 align:start position:0%
efficient with the use with the hmos and
all

02:53:04.990 --> 02:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:53:06.630 --> 02:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:53:10.750 --> 02:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
okay S no F further questions thank you
 
02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you very
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
much Norm can I make a
 
02:53:23.870 --> 02:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
comment yes P yeah during the break I
 
02:53:26.150 --> 02:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
got a call this is not on this on
 
02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
revenues um I got a call from dve juv at
 
02:53:30.990 --> 02:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
the business industry
 
02:53:33.510 --> 02:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
Association he wanted to talk about the
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill uh 281 the uh single sales
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
Factor Bill he wanted me to know that he
 
02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
wanted us to know that they are not
 
02:53:43.830 --> 02:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill because
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
their membership is totally split on it
 
02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
um matter of fact he he's invited me I'm
 
02:53:51.870 --> 02:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
going to speak to the finance committee
 
02:53:55.150 --> 02:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
of that Association on the 12th to talk
 
02:53:57.510 --> 02:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
about it uh along with one of the
 
02:53:58.750 --> 02:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
members on the commission that we were
 
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
on Carl I can't remember his last name
 
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
now one of the accountants is going to
 
02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
be speaking on that so but the news is
 
02:54:06.910 --> 02:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
02:54:09.790 --> 02:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
split uh which is interesting uh which
 
02:54:11.550 --> 02:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
tells me that their perception is
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
there're going to be some winners and
 
02:54:12.720 --> 02:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
there're going to be some winners and
some

02:54:13.510 --> 02:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
losers and uh depending on the kind of
 
02:54:18.150 --> 02:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
business they're in that's what it means
 
02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:19.309 align:start position:0%
business they're in that's what it means
yep

02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:54:21.950 --> 02:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay I just want everybody to know that
 
02:54:23.790 --> 02:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
good I'll update everybody after that
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
meeting any other good information for
 
02:54:28.750 --> 02:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:33.389 --> 02:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
anybody say again directly to me Norm um
 
02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:38.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

is actually very good um so he's another
 
03:56:47.910 --> 03:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
one that could potentially be in our

queue of speakers for all of this stuff
 
03:57:00.950 --> 03:57:00.960 align:start position:0%

that uh this noon time I had an
 
03:58:52.189 --> 03:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to the governor's
 
03:58:52.199 --> 03:58:53.110 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to the governor's
budget

03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:58:55.469 --> 03:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
director and the governor is going to be
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
presenting his budget to the finance

committee on the
 
03:59:02.670 --> 03:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
17th and the governor's budget director
 
03:59:06.630 --> 03:59:06.640 align:start position:0%

the 18th at 9:00 for two hours relative
 
03:59:13.670 --> 03:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
to the revenue estimates that were used
 
03:59:15.389 --> 03:59:15.399 align:start position:0%
in the Governor's budget so we'll have
 
03:59:17.950 --> 03:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to go over
 
03:59:21.790 --> 03:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
that with the governor's budget
 
03:59:25.189 --> 03:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
director also I see that Chris has sent
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
the link to all the documents and
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
that uh before we get started with the
 
03:59:36.640 --> 03:59:37.750 align:start position:0%
that uh before we get started with the
uh

03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:40.349 --> 03:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
Highway like to have Chris go through
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the worksheet associated with the
 
03:59:43.600 --> 03:59:44.870 align:start position:0%
the uh the worksheet associated with the
highway

03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
highway
 
03:59:48.309 --> 03:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
CR thank you rep some major I'm going to
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh screen share the single page document
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
with you and just kind of walk you
 
03:59:51.760 --> 03:59:57.389 align:start position:0%
with you and just kind of walk you
through

03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:00.189 --> 04:00:00.199 align:start position:0%
that so you should be seeing um Highway
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
fund Revenue estimates in thousands has
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety in the first
 
04:00:09.070 --> 04:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
row so when U Mr laevo and Mr Brier came
 
04:00:11.110 --> 04:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
in and spoke with you the other day they
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
provided estimates on the road
 
04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
toll on the on the motor vehicles and
 
04:00:16.800 --> 04:00:18.269 align:start position:0%
toll on the on the motor vehicles and
then

04:00:18.269 --> 04:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:00:20.189 --> 04:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous and what I did is I just
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
rolled up to the subtotals for each of
 
04:00:23.630 --> 04:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
those there's detail behind each one of
 
04:00:23.640 --> 04:00:24.510 align:start position:0%
those there's detail behind each one of
these

04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:00:28.149 --> 04:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
lines and in the M on R 11 the MV
 
04:00:30.070 --> 04:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous that's where the judicial
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
branch um estimates are also contained
 
04:00:35.670 --> 04:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
typically but because the judicial
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
branch and Department of Safety were
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
slightly different in some of their
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
estimates I broke it out starting on
 
04:00:40.439 --> 04:00:42.469 align:start position:0%
estimates I broke it out starting on
line

04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
15 not and no neither one is right or
 
04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
wrong it's just different approaches
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
different um ideas on what they they're
 
04:00:50.349 --> 04:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
seeing or expect to have happen going
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
forward but I just wanted the committee
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
to see on rows 17 and 18 um the slight
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
differences between what they were
 
04:00:58.830 --> 04:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
estimating as you're thinking about
 
04:01:01.070 --> 04:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
ranges and what you want to project for
 
04:01:03.630 --> 04:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted Highway fund and then
 
04:01:06.630 --> 04:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
on excuse me and then on line 23 is the
 
04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation they have a
 
04:01:10.469 --> 04:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
small amount of Revenue it's about
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
$200,000 um that they project and that's
 
04:01:16.110 --> 04:01:16.120 align:start position:0%
typically related to land sale or um
 
04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
property that was bought with Highway
 
04:01:20.950 --> 04:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
funds and it goes back into the highway
 
04:01:24.110 --> 04:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
fund so that that's the one pager and
 
04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
then in the worksheet there's a page
 
04:01:27.790 --> 04:01:27.800 align:start position:0%
that rolls us up even tighter where
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
you'd only have the line of road toll
 
04:01:33.229 --> 04:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and miscellaneous so I
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
believe for the conversation to start
 
04:01:36.990 --> 04:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
you'd want to um we'll reference this
 
04:01:40.070 --> 04:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
tool and today you know I invited um Mr
 
04:01:44.429 --> 04:01:44.439 align:start position:0%
Lavoy uh Mr Brier um Mr Raymond from the
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and Marie Mullen from do
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
aailable to talk to you and to help you
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
um understand any any uh transactions
 
04:01:55.389 --> 04:01:55.399 align:start position:0%
that occur with the highway
 
04:01:57.950 --> 04:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
fund so I'll leave it at that and um
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
major thank you Chris and who wants to

04:02:19.469 --> 04:02:19.479 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:02:24.910 --> 04:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
yes um so as we presented last week um
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
we we took a relatively conservative
 
04:02:32.630 --> 04:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
approach with our with our estimates um
 
04:02:36.030 --> 04:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
and and really broke this up into two
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
sections uh of considerations so the
 
04:02:41.670 --> 04:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
road toll is the area that has been
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
impacted the most by the p
 
04:02:47.950 --> 04:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
pic continues um to be impacted by the
 
04:02:51.149 --> 04:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic motor vehicle revenues have
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
been relatively
 
04:02:55.630 --> 04:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
stable throughout the P we expect them
 
04:02:58.229 --> 04:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
to stable moving
 
04:03:01.389 --> 04:03:01.399 align:start position:0%
forward um so our our road toll
 
04:03:04.110 --> 04:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
estimates um one of the questions that
 
04:03:06.790 --> 04:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
came up prior uh during our presentation
 
04:03:09.790 --> 04:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
had to do with how do we account for um
 
04:03:09.800 --> 04:03:11.110 align:start position:0%
had to do with how do we account for um
EV

04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
EV
 
04:03:14.670 --> 04:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
Vehicles move to electric vehicles
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
and um I think I think um the the the
 
04:03:20.630 --> 04:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
the way that we account for that is is
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
not for Ev vehicles in and of themselves
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
because we're not expecting a c change
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
in Behavior over the next bium in 22 and
 
04:03:33.630 --> 04:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
23 there will be more people adopting um
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
moving from combustion to EV vehicles
 
04:03:37.590 --> 04:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
but we're expecting the rates to be
 
04:03:40.590 --> 04:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
consistent with the prior years um uh
 
04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
rate of of trans those types of Vehicles
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
we're also expecting uh fuel efficiency
 
04:03:50.950 --> 04:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
rates to continue to improve um which
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
would typically put downward pressure on
 
04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
um on on gasoline usage and therefore on
 
04:04:00.790 --> 04:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
the road toll uh but if if if you recall
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
from our uh previous presentation when
 
04:04:06.510 --> 04:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
we provided numbers from 16 through 23
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
the period from fy6 through FY uh 18 and
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
19 we're still seeing a one about a 1%
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
increase year over year even as uh fuel
 
04:04:18.550 --> 04:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
efficiency is improving even as people
 
04:04:21.149 --> 04:04:21.159 align:start position:0%
are starting to adopt um electric
 
04:04:24.550 --> 04:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
vehicles um we we are assuming that
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
similar uh type of of rate of increase
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
between 22 and 23 and that's what you're
 
04:04:32.110 --> 04:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
seeing here in the road toll the change
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
from 12.3 million to
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
121.5 million um we're just not
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
expecting within the next bium um we're
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
not expecting all of the conditions that
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
would be necessary to be present for a
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
big change in driver o uh electric
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle ownership so there's still a
 
04:04:54.670 --> 04:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
significant way for us to go in the
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
state for infrastructure as far as uh
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
charging stations especially fast
 
04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
charging stations um we also as you know
 
04:05:05.550 --> 04:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
we're a rural state so there's I think R
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
range anxiety in um in our our residents
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
than we do um in some other more
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas um if you're going
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
into the North country and you're hiking
 
04:05:17.149 --> 04:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
for the day you're going to be concerned
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
if your electric vehicle has enough uh
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
Power has enough energy to get you back
 
04:05:25.110 --> 04:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
home if it's a two-hour drive one way um
 
04:05:26.830 --> 04:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
and so uh and we also don't have any
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
State uh tax incentives uh for Ev
 
04:05:32.550 --> 04:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
ownership um like some other states
 
04:05:33.950 --> 04:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
might have so that that's not going to
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
be an incentive for people to to be
 
04:05:38.429 --> 04:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
early adopters so because of those
 
04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
factors while while there will be an
 
04:05:42.870 --> 04:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of EVS we don't
 
04:05:44.670 --> 04:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
believe it'll be significant enough to
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
change our um our approach for
 
04:05:50.670 --> 04:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
estimating revenues in 22 and 23 uh and
 
04:05:52.590 --> 04:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
so that's essentially what we've done uh
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
here with the road
 
04:05:57.670 --> 04:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
toll motor vehicle Revenue estimates are
 
04:06:00.110 --> 04:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
relatively straightforward um as I
 
04:06:00.120 --> 04:06:01.189 align:start position:0%
relatively straightforward um as I
mentioned

04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
registration um haven't been significant
 
04:06:06.550 --> 04:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
issues there from a pandemic perspective
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
we still believe people are going to be
 
04:06:11.070 --> 04:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
um registering their vehicles they
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
they're required to by law um motor
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
vehic operators same situation in 22 and
 
04:06:20.110 --> 04:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
23 you do see an increase but that has
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
to do with the the dip year that occurs
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
um every five years and so we're
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
currently in the dip year in
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
fy21 uh will be out of the dip year in
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
22 and so we're expecting the licensing
 
04:06:35.389 --> 04:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
license return to normal levels in 22
 
04:06:39.149 --> 04:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
and 23 inspections and titles are two
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
areas that are also flat um from a from
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
a regular year year perspective for DMV
 
04:06:47.429 --> 04:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
revenues haven't been impacted by the
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we expect them to remain
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
relatively flat moving forward into 22
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
and 23 um the miscellaneous uh line um
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
that did get an an increase from prior
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
years because that's where the plea by
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
mail revenues are being
 
04:07:05.870 --> 04:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
recorded um and um that's that's
 
04:07:07.389 --> 04:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
essentially what you're seeing there is
 
04:07:10.469 --> 04:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
is as traffic volume returns to normal
 
04:07:13.229 --> 04:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
levels uh pre-pandemic levels we would
 
04:07:15.630 --> 04:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
expect that the number uh of tickets
 
04:07:17.670 --> 04:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
would also increase and that the
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
corresponding revenues would increase as
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
well and so our estimates in 22 and 23
 
04:07:26.030 --> 04:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh reflect that increase going from 11.6
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
take St I'm sorry I couldn't hear you uh
 
04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
would you take any questions now
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely any questions at all and
 
04:07:47.950 --> 04:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
I do have Scott Brier who's the um the
 
04:07:50.109 --> 04:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
Euro chief of road toll available with
 
04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
me today as well representative
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
bronley actually a roto question but I
 
04:07:58.469 --> 04:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
I'll ask it if if uh if you feel more
 
04:08:00.550 --> 04:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable with Mr Brier answering at
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
that time so you know back in uh 2020
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
the plan was 127 million doll for road
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
toll uh we came in at 117.8 that's
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm of what happened that last
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
quarter I imagine with the uh everything
 
04:08:20.109 --> 04:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
shutting down and then and then you you
 
04:08:21.630 --> 04:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
have it going up but you have it going
 
04:08:24.149 --> 04:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
up in 23 up to only
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
121.5 million so and we were in pretty
 
04:08:31.830 --> 04:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
good shape at 127 million plan so we're
 
04:08:35.189 --> 04:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
still way under what the that plan was
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
from two years ago from when we we
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
estimated a couple years ago so what I'm
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
getting at did you did you did you
 
04:08:48.550 --> 04:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
factor in any change in uh post covid
 
04:08:50.309 --> 04:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
that more people will continue to work
 
04:08:52.469 --> 04:08:52.479 align:start position:0%
at home because businesses have
 
04:08:55.550 --> 04:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
discovered that hey we don't need these
 
04:08:59.149 --> 04:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
offices anymore CO's gone but business
 
04:09:01.149 --> 04:09:01.159 align:start position:0%
practic has changed less commuters have
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
you factored that into your thinking
 
04:09:07.389 --> 04:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
yeah we we we absolutely did so we um
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
two two levels of that one is less
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
commuters as are assuming that people
 
04:09:15.630 --> 04:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
will be commuting down as you know many
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
people who live in New Hampshire work in
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or in the neighboring
 
04:09:20.750 --> 04:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
states but primarily in Massachusetts
 
04:09:23.950 --> 04:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
and in the Boston area and we um we are
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
assuming that a lot of those commuters
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
will will remain working from home if
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
not 100% of the time a significant
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
portion of the time and maybe they only
 
04:09:34.149 --> 04:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
need to go to the office once a week or
 
04:09:36.189 --> 04:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
once a month or or or some sort of
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
arrangement like that um we also needed
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
to consider some of the increases that
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen during the pandemic which had
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
helped to Bo raise our our revenues we
 
04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
had neighboring um folks who were
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
visiting the state uh because there
 
04:09:53.309 --> 04:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
weren't other options and they couldn't
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
travel uh across the country or they
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
weren't comfortable traveling by plane
 
04:10:01.510 --> 04:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
um or or going uh internationally so we
 
04:10:03.070 --> 04:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh if you recall in the summer we had
 
04:10:05.469 --> 04:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
lots of people hiking um and that was
 
04:10:08.109 --> 04:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
causing its own its own problems we
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't expect that's going to continue
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
indefinitely either so we'll go back to
 
04:10:14.109 --> 04:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
our more normal
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
um um kind of uh more normal tourism and
 
04:10:21.550 --> 04:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
travel levels so our assumptions for our
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 estimates um we're assuming
 
04:10:29.830 --> 04:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
that the the level of change from
 
04:10:33.469 --> 04:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
preco to postco would result in about a
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
7% decrease in um in usage and fuel
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
usage across the board so that would be
 
04:10:42.309 --> 04:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
the combination of people who are no
 
04:10:45.030 --> 04:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
longer commuting combined with people
 
04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
who have been cooped up and don't want
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
to be uh staying in the state but are
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
going to leave and fly um and um for for
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
their vacations moving forward so that
 
04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
that um as I mentioned before we're
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
conservative with our estimates that's a
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
conservative number um that's really
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
something that um that the committee
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
would need to discuss and decide what
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
the correct number would be we
 
04:11:14.550 --> 04:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
originally talked about a 5% um
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
Plateau but some of the um some of the
 
04:11:21.630 --> 04:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
recent Revenue collections on the road
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
toll in the past several months led us
 
04:11:26.790 --> 04:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
to revise that down to 7% because we
 
04:11:28.429 --> 04:11:28.439 align:start position:0%
were seeing a recovery that was headed
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
towards that 5% number U but it dropped
 
04:11:33.990 --> 04:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
off significantly and it dropped off
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
before kind of that second wave started
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
you can see a correlation with the
 
04:11:42.670 --> 04:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
second of covid um but but it's really
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
tied into into the um the tourism
 
04:11:48.189 --> 04:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
seasons and the shoulder season after
 
04:11:50.389 --> 04:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
the weather started um getting cooler
 
04:11:52.830 --> 04:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
but before the snow flies that period of
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
time saw a significant decline in in
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
traffic um and and Scott if you want to
 
04:12:00.750 --> 04:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
jump in at any point to to add any
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:10.349 --> 04:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
please um I don't have anything really
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
to add what Steve saying is pretty
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
accurate and basically after the Fage
 
04:12:18.189 --> 04:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
season that's when we started seeing a
 
04:12:21.149 --> 04:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
decline are you all set representative
 
04:12:24.070 --> 04:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
Bry that's a followup or actually a
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
different question um I know Turnpike
 
04:12:29.710 --> 04:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
money isn't in here at all but do you
 
04:12:32.910 --> 04:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
have a access to Turnpike data like the
 
04:12:32.920 --> 04:12:34.070 align:start position:0%
have a access to Turnpike data like the
Easy

04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
Easy
 
04:12:38.910 --> 04:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
Pass can you tell from the Easy Pass um
 
04:12:41.469 --> 04:12:41.479 align:start position:0%
ownership uh which vehicles are from out
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
of state or in state is that something
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
that's P or allowed or how do you how do
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
you get your estimate of out of-state
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
Travelers more or less is is that one of
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
the ways you can do that that would be
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
one of the ways I I I defer to dot on on
 
04:12:59.149 --> 04:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
what type of data is available through
 
04:13:02.429 --> 04:13:02.439 align:start position:0%
the Easy paath System I'm not sure um
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what that looks like but we
 
04:13:07.389 --> 04:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
we do um dot shares some of their
 
04:13:09.109 --> 04:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
traffic reports with us on a regular
 
04:13:11.950 --> 04:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
basis which helps us to um project
 
04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
what's coming and um align with what
 
04:13:16.870 --> 04:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
we're seeing from road toll Collections
 
04:13:19.429 --> 04:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
and um you know we we would see a
 
04:13:21.790 --> 04:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
correlation between the traffic on the
 
04:13:24.830 --> 04:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
turnpike system and then a decline in in
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
road toll revenues they also have
 
04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
traffic counters throughout the state
 
04:13:30.189 --> 04:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
that aren't on the main highways but on
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
the other thorough fairs and and
 
04:13:35.149 --> 04:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
anecdotally what we've seen and again
 
04:13:37.950 --> 04:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
dot is really the P the the the agency
 
04:13:39.630 --> 04:13:39.640 align:start position:0%
that should be speaking to this but from
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
the data that they shared with us um and
 
04:13:45.109 --> 04:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
from discussions we've had it appeared
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
that the local traffic level was
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
starting to come back to to to closer to
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
normal levels it was the interstates and
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
the Turnpike system travel that spiked
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
in the Summer started really coming back
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then dropping off significantly so
 
04:14:01.510 --> 04:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
you can make some assumptions there even
 
04:14:03.229 --> 04:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
without the easy pass that a lot of that
 
04:14:05.910 --> 04:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
traffic is coming from out of state um
 
04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
and then anecdotally too um you know
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
just looking around if if I did some
 
04:14:13.229 --> 04:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
hiking this summer as well I saw the m
 
04:14:15.550 --> 04:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
chuses plates everywhere um I've done
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
skiing with with with my I've gone
 
04:14:20.349 --> 04:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
skiing with my daughter this this season
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of out estate plates um in
 
04:14:25.510 --> 04:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
the Lots so you know combining all those
 
04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
factors together it does seem like we're
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
still getting a lot of Tourism traffic
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
um that's that that's obviously they're
 
04:14:33.990 --> 04:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing fuel when they're in the
 
04:14:36.349 --> 04:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
State uh best case scenario I just want
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
to agree with you on that I did some
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
hiking this summer and every time
 
04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
I and it's like 50 over 50% of the
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
plates are out of state mostly Mass some
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
Elliot unmute yourself
 
04:14:59.830 --> 04:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
Bob Bob you're muted can you hear me now
 
04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh this is a personal question uh
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
for Steve L um is there because of the
 
04:15:06.840 --> 04:15:07.990 align:start position:0%
for Steve L um is there because of the
corona

04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
corona
 
04:15:12.269 --> 04:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
19 uh effect on the certificates of
 
04:15:17.149 --> 04:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
titles being issued is it slowed it down
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
significantly because uh a couple of
 
04:15:23.710 --> 04:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
months ago I paid off my car and I'm
 
04:15:26.830 --> 04:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
have yet to see the retitle to it and my
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
wife has a new car and she doesn't have
 
04:15:32.590 --> 04:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
a title to it is there a problem with
 
04:15:37.550 --> 04:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
the issuances of certificates of
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
title um so I wouldn't say there's a
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
problem but there's certainly a delay um
 
04:15:47.309 --> 04:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
the the DMV has been impacted as as All
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
State agencies have with the the revenue
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
constraints that we faced and the hiring
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
freeze that was put into place to make
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
sure that um you know we minimize the
 
04:16:00.550 --> 04:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
impact on of declining revenues on the
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
state budget and so unfortunately that
 
04:16:07.109 --> 04:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
that has caused delays in some areas uh
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
and and title processing um hasn't
 
04:16:11.790 --> 04:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't escaped so there are there are
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
some delays in title processing but it
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
really has to do with Staffing levels um
 
04:16:20.189 --> 04:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
a combination of both vacancies that uh
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to fill due to a
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
lot of these Revenue constraints we're
 
04:16:26.670 --> 04:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
talking about today that we're seeing in
 
04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
fy21 um and then also due to um covid
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
protocols so if uh somebody's family
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
member were exposed and if they're
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
unable to um uh if if they're required
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
to quarantine uh they can't come in to
 
04:16:46.990 --> 04:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
work and process those titles so uh
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%
that's a challenge that DMV faces on a
 
04:16:51.309 --> 04:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
daily basis uh director B is always
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
looking at her Staffing levels and
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
shifting resources as best as she can um
 
04:16:57.630 --> 04:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
but but you're right you're not you're
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
you're not alone in seeing some of those
 
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
delays um I can just uh let you know
 
04:17:04.269 --> 04:17:04.279 align:start position:0%
that that DMV is aware of them and
 
04:17:06.269 --> 04:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
they're working as hard as they can to
 
04:17:08.229 --> 04:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
hire new people and keep the staff
 
04:17:10.630 --> 04:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
levels as high as they can be given the
 
04:17:12.189 --> 04:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
downward pressure we're facing on our
 
04:17:12.199 --> 04:17:14.830 align:start position:0%
downward pressure we're facing on our
revenues

04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'll give you another
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
month thank
 
04:17:26.830 --> 04:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.990 --> 04:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
committee I don't see any hands raised
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.840 --> 04:17:51.149 align:start position:0%

04:17:51.149 --> 04:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:54.189 --> 04:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
stra did we lose I was just disconnected
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
am I am I back there you go all right
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay um so so we talked about road
 
04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees oh and now my video's on
 
04:18:14.429 --> 04:18:14.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Chris
 
04:18:16.990 --> 04:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
hello got it I noticed my camera wasn't
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
on I had asked him if he could turn it
 
04:18:22.590 --> 04:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
on so um hi everybody the so if we move
 
04:18:26.309 --> 04:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
on to the um I guess really probably the
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
judicial branch motor vehicle finds
 
04:18:30.990 --> 04:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
collection is the next area that we
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
would talk about um and and Chris Shay
 
04:18:37.710 --> 04:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that our estimates
 
04:18:40.349 --> 04:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
differed slightly with uh the judicial
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
branch estimates and and from the
 
04:18:46.109 --> 04:18:46.119 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and I connected on those
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
because we just wanted to make sure that
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
you know we weren't missing something
 
04:18:52.149 --> 04:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day I think it
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
really just comes down to um two
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
different approaches on um and and two
 
04:18:59.870 --> 04:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
different assumptions on on where these
 
04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
these fees will be so this has to do
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
with court fines um so they're motor
 
04:19:06.189 --> 04:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle fines but they're collected
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
through the courts and um we did see
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
some growth year-over-year growth
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
recover recovery I should say recovery
 
04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
from prior uh declines over the over the
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
last several months and and what Doss
 
04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
did was we projected that out assuming
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we would have continued rates of
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
growth in those areas and we ended up at
 
04:19:31.469 --> 04:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
4.3 million um so obviously the judicial
 
04:19:34.830 --> 04:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
branch had 3.9 not too far off and and I
 
04:19:36.189 --> 04:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for them they they
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
can Donna could jump in at any time um
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
for 22 our estimates are very close and
 
04:19:46.630 --> 04:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
then for 23 is where we start to di
 
04:19:49.710 --> 04:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
diverge a bit uh we're projecting
 
04:19:52.590 --> 04:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
similar rates to pre-co levels uh
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
because as I mentioned we're we're
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
thinking that traffic will recover even
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
if it's not commuting traffic we're
 
04:19:59.349 --> 04:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
still going to have more people on the
 
04:20:02.510 --> 04:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
roads uh so there'd be more violations
 
04:20:04.750 --> 04:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh and so we're expecting in 23 those
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
amounts to kind of to recover back
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
closer to preco levels the 4.8 million
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
is still a decline year-over-year
 
04:20:15.790 --> 04:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
if you went back to fy19 we still we're
 
04:20:18.590 --> 04:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
we're still being conservative there um
 
04:20:21.309 --> 04:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
the the the judicial branch estimate is
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
just even more conservative than that uh
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
because they had noted a downward Trend
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
in revenues for motor vehicle fines um
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
and extended that Trend further um and a
 
04:20:34.189 --> 04:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
bit more aggressively than we had
 
04:20:38.670 --> 04:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
decided to so um and I think uh I I do
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
believe that Donna Raymond is on is on
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
the call um and she could jump in and
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
provide some more color on the judicial
 
04:20:46.670 --> 04:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
branch estimate if if that's something
 
04:20:49.870 --> 04:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
the committee would like Donna you want
 
04:20:52.349 --> 04:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
to make comments
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
on the judicial branch numbers yeah yes
 
04:21:00.229 --> 04:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um so yeah as Steve
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned I am a little more
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
conservative I think by Nature anyways
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
but I am trying to base it on data that
 
04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
I have observed um through now
 
04:21:11.149 --> 04:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
December's um and January's figures as
 
04:21:13.870 --> 04:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
well um but we are seeing a little bit
 
04:21:17.189 --> 04:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
of growth um which is um encouraging
 
04:21:17.199 --> 04:21:17.950 align:start position:0%
of growth um which is um encouraging
about

04:21:17.950 --> 04:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
6% I think so that is reflected in our
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 projections and then in
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
04:21:28.990 --> 04:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
22 excuse me I am still continuing to
 
04:21:32.510 --> 04:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
see expect some growth but also what is
 
04:21:35.469 --> 04:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
reflected in that number is the Court's
 
04:21:38.189 --> 04:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
continued processing of backlog because
 
04:21:40.590 --> 04:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
as has been mentioned in this meeting
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
the courts have also Court staff have
 
04:21:45.630 --> 04:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
also been impacted by covid following
 
04:21:47.469 --> 04:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
the protocols of someone either test
 
04:21:49.309 --> 04:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
positive has been around somebody who
 
04:21:50.910 --> 04:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
was tested positive is caring for
 
04:21:52.870 --> 04:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
someone in their home that type of thing
 
04:21:55.750 --> 04:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court which processes um the
 
04:21:58.550 --> 04:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle finds mentioned that
 
04:22:01.109 --> 04:22:01.119 align:start position:0%
couple of months ago about 25% of their
 
04:22:03.670 --> 04:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
staff were out at one time or another
 
04:22:06.109 --> 04:22:06.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with covid related issues so it
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
did impact the ability for the courts to
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
continue to process these cases in a
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
timely manner so the ick um in that
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
you're seeing in fiscal year 22 is
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
reflecting the continued catchup of
 
04:22:21.070 --> 04:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
those cases I'm assuming by the time
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 rolls around the courts
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
will have been caught up I'm hoping in
 
04:22:27.309 --> 04:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
the next six months that will be the
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
case but with other things going on with
 
04:22:31.149 --> 04:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
these new covid variants that are out
 
04:22:32.630 --> 04:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
there and the uncertainty about those I
 
04:22:35.070 --> 04:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to be too um optimistic about
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
that I'd rather be a little more
 
04:22:40.349 --> 04:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
conservative so again um by the time
 
04:22:43.309 --> 04:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 rolls around assuming
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
that the additional revenues that you're
 
04:22:47.670 --> 04:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
seeing as a result of catchup are no
 
04:22:50.189 --> 04:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
longer there but I wanted to reflect
 
04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
this downward Trend that we have
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
continued to see I think since fiscal
 
04:22:53.920 --> 04:22:55.149 align:start position:0%
continued to see I think since fiscal
year

04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
2016 and I you know I've often pondered
 
04:22:59.429 --> 04:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
what causes that I mean it's
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
year-over-year it is consistent it is
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
undeniable now I know I believe back on
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
January 1 of
 
04:23:11.109 --> 04:23:11.119 align:start position:0%
2016 about eight um motor vehicle um
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
case uh motor vehicle um ppes that had
 
04:23:18.349 --> 04:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
been musters were changed to plea by
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
mail so yeah I would expect that a lot
 
04:23:22.269 --> 04:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
of people would take advantage of the
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
ple by mail option and so we would um
 
04:23:27.790 --> 04:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
see a reduction in our revenues based on
 
04:23:30.910 --> 04:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
those eight um citation types whereas
 
04:23:33.870 --> 04:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
safety would see an uptick um from those
 
04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing that changed I
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
believe I don't know if it was exactly
 
04:23:37.830 --> 04:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
the same time but right around the same
 
04:23:40.710 --> 04:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
time was um some of the highway speeds
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
were increased in the uh North part of
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
the state from 65 to 70 so again you
 
04:23:47.550 --> 04:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
would see less you would expect to see
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
less tickets being issued as a result of
 
04:23:52.349 --> 04:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
that um but again we're going back five
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
years now why do we continue to see this
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
downward this you know undeniable
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
downward Trend and I've been pondering
 
04:24:02.710 --> 04:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
how we could get at that um and I really
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't know anything other than to look
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
at bu you know citation type the amounts
 
04:24:10.429 --> 04:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
that are being issued so we kind of get
 
04:24:12.389 --> 04:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
a baseline are we seeing Trends there we
 
04:24:14.189 --> 04:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
have to look at it over the years and
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
then of those how many of them are plea
 
04:24:18.510 --> 04:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
by mail and of those that are actually
 
04:24:20.349 --> 04:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
ple by mail how many people choose to do
 
04:24:22.990 --> 04:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
that how many people choose um to
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
contest it go to the courts and then
 
04:24:26.189 --> 04:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
what is the outcome
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to say is I think
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's possible to get at this data but I
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
think it would be a lot of work but I
 
04:24:34.030 --> 04:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
don't know any other way to try to
 
04:24:35.830 --> 04:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
untangle this because other than those
 
04:24:38.590 --> 04:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
two factors that I mentioned um I don't
 
04:24:40.750 --> 04:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
really know other significant changes
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
that would account for this Contin
 
04:24:48.070 --> 04:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.510 --> 04:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
seeing um Donna on The Plea by
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.279 --> 04:24:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
then

04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:25:03.790 --> 04:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
um it isn't no no it's an opportunity
 
04:25:05.950 --> 04:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
for you to maybe maybe have your fine
 
04:25:10.269 --> 04:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
reduced or not issued at all but if you
 
04:25:12.510 --> 04:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
are found guilty you you pay that that
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
amount I guess is the way I should
 
04:25:14.319 --> 04:25:16.510 align:start position:0%
amount I guess is the way I should
answer

04:25:16.510 --> 04:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
that okay but that doesn't explain why
 
04:25:23.870 --> 04:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:26.950 --> 04:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
return I don't think so I mean again is
 
04:25:29.189 --> 04:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
that you you'd have to look at it over
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
the years and say are less tickets being
 
04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
issued you it could start from there but
 
04:25:35.149 --> 04:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
we don't know unless we look at the data
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to say
 
04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative BR
 
04:25:41.239 --> 04:25:44.790 align:start position:0%
okay representative BR
me

04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:47.870 --> 04:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
got there I got it okay I had I had to
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
get to the button thank you um uh
 
04:25:53.870 --> 04:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
represent a major so uh so we got three
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
factors here less cars on the road would
 
04:25:58.910 --> 04:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
probably impact less tickets we got ple
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
by mail which you can match up with uh
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
you know the other side in terms of
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
those are getting the plea by mail but
 
04:26:10.189 --> 04:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
the backlog um on the backlog so how
 
04:26:12.429 --> 04:26:12.439 align:start position:0%
many of these cases are jury cases vers
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
is just going before a judge I would
 
04:26:18.189 --> 04:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
imagine they'd be less likely to have
 
04:26:20.670 --> 04:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
jur 12 people juries jurors sitting next
 
04:26:23.149 --> 04:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
to each other in the co times versus
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
just having a
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
judge U hearing correct I would not
 
04:26:29.830 --> 04:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
expect that very many if any of these
 
04:26:33.030 --> 04:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
are jury I think they're all yeah and I
 
04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
would think a lot of them don't even go
 
04:26:36.429 --> 04:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
before a judge you may be um meeting
 
04:26:37.790 --> 04:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:26:39.870 --> 04:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutor to discuss the case just
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
playing out or something yes right yeah
 
04:26:45.710 --> 04:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:26:48.870 --> 04:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:26:53.309 --> 04:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
alamy thank you I I was Wonder Don't You
 
04:26:57.149 --> 04:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
have records of how many of the cases
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
are motor vehicle fins
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
and Department of Safety have records of
 
04:27:07.229 --> 04:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
how many tickets they issue and get
 
04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
fines back for that could just be added
 
04:27:12.750 --> 04:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
together well
 
04:27:15.870 --> 04:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
I believe at the end of the day safety
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
would have all of the information
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
because it starts with somebody issuing
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
a citation to someone which is on
 
04:27:25.030 --> 04:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
safety's end then it's a matter of is
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me is the citation um eligible
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
for plea by mail some of them are must
 
04:27:30.429 --> 04:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
appear they coming to the court
 
04:27:32.590 --> 04:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
regardless but safety would know that
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
then it would also know if they are plea
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
by mail right but then of those that are
 
04:27:40.149 --> 04:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
CLE by mail do people wish to contest
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
them then it comes over to us but
 
04:27:44.950 --> 04:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
eventually there is some resolution to
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
the case either excuse me they're found
 
04:27:49.870 --> 04:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
guilty and have to pay it or they um
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
they're found not guilty for whatever
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
reason and they don't have to pay it and
 
04:27:55.269 --> 04:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
then that information gets sent back
 
04:27:58.269 --> 04:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
over to safety so I believe that like I
 
04:28:00.429 --> 04:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
said at the end of the day all of it
 
04:28:02.269 --> 04:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
rests with safety we the courts would
 
04:28:03.670 --> 04:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
not know about the plea by Mals because
 
04:28:08.189 --> 04:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
safety and if I
 
04:28:11.119 --> 04:28:13.550 align:start position:0%
safety and if I
may

04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
Steve um yeah so so don is Don is
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct um you know if you
 
04:28:21.109 --> 04:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
think of the citations they're being
 
04:28:23.670 --> 04:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
issued by State Police and they're being
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
issued by local PDS um we have um an
 
04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
electronic ticketing system which state
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
police utilizes and many local PDS
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
utilize which allows us to capture that
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
data very easily those local PDS that
 
04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
aren't using e ticketing um are using
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
paper tickets and those are all coming
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
in and have to be entered in uh on a
 
04:28:49.149 --> 04:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
very manual basis so if you look at the
 
04:28:52.109 --> 04:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
driver of this Revenue the first driver
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
really is tck volume of tickets being
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
written um and that's the that's the
 
04:28:59.109 --> 04:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
piece that we need to determine what's a
 
04:29:01.630 --> 04:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable estimate which will bring us
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
back down to um the first level piece
 
04:29:08.590 --> 04:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
which will bring us back down to um um
 
04:29:10.950 --> 04:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the uh you know how many tickets are
 
04:29:14.269 --> 04:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
being are being um issued is that is a
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
measure of how much traffic is on the
 
04:29:18.830 --> 04:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
roadways how many officers are available
 
04:29:21.910 --> 04:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
to issue tickets um th those types of
 
04:29:25.349 --> 04:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
factors then the split occurs The Plea
 
04:29:27.349 --> 04:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
by mail is easy because it's the it's
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
this it's the written um posted fee that
 
04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
will be paid uh the court fine component
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
there might be an adjustment and so
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's where um there's an opportunity
 
04:29:42.189 --> 04:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
for um for for the judges to to
 
04:29:44.990 --> 04:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
potentially um wave the fee entirely or
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
reduce the fee amount due to um
 
04:29:49.990 --> 04:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
inability to pay or hardship or those
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
types of things so there's a lot of
 
04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
leeway um and that that's another layer
 
04:29:56.469 --> 04:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
of of um
 
04:29:59.070 --> 04:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
uncertainty that falls into this level
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
of um of Revenue Source here so even if
 
04:30:04.910 --> 04:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
we know the total ticket amount we're
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
not going to know how that's going to be
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
adjusted in in 2023 if people are
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
contesting them in in in the courts so I
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
think I think what it comes down to is
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know safety and um the two different
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
estimates are are assuming a different
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
Baseline level of ticketing because
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
eventually we're seeing a decline but
 
04:30:27.990 --> 04:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
the decline won't go to zero the decline
 
04:30:30.309 --> 04:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
will eventually level off and be the new
 
04:30:32.349 --> 04:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
Baseline we're assuming that new
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
Baseline would bring us to about 4.8
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
million um and and the judicial branch
 
04:30:39.030 --> 04:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
is assuming that new Baseline would
 
04:30:44.229 --> 04:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.590 --> 04:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
just a question uh of interest on a ple
 
04:30:55.910 --> 04:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
by male what is the range of fines on
 
04:30:58.510 --> 04:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
these play by
 
04:31:01.429 --> 04:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
males oh gosh I don't know off the top
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
of my head but um one of the changes
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
that Donna mentioned at the beginning
 
04:31:08.870 --> 04:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
those were the highpe speed finds that
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
used to be must appears I think those
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
were up to 4 $400 um those are some of
 
04:31:17.790 --> 04:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
the highest fines um and then and then
 
04:31:20.109 --> 04:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
the lowest the lowest fines you know a
 
04:31:23.910 --> 04:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
lot a lot lower than that but uh I'm
 
04:31:25.870 --> 04:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
just going off of memory um I could
 
04:31:28.189 --> 04:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
certainly get actual figures for you but
 
04:31:28.199 --> 04:31:29.149 align:start position:0%
certainly get actual figures for you but
it's

04:31:29.149 --> 04:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:31:33.269 --> 04:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
usually up it could be up to around
 
04:31:37.630 --> 04:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
$400 but on the low part um typically if
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
you go through a stop sign or if you're
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.389 --> 04:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
what would typically be the cost of one
 
04:31:46.399 --> 04:31:47.670 align:start position:0%
what would typically be the cost of one
of

04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
these um I don't know off the top of my
 
04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
head I'm I'm gonna see if I can pull
 
04:31:55.750 --> 04:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
this up very quickly
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
here originally ask is because if you're
 
04:32:01.269 --> 04:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
talking 50
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
$75 it may be cheaper for somebody that
 
04:32:07.630 --> 04:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
has to deal with this rather than taking
 
04:32:10.349 --> 04:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
a day off work Transportation cost and
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
all that is cheaper than
 
04:32:16.229 --> 04:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
yep so I'm looking at the uniform fine
 
04:32:19.349 --> 04:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
schedule right now um that lists all of
 
04:32:19.359 --> 04:32:20.429 align:start position:0%
schedule right now um that lists all of
these

04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
violations um and um it looks like you
 
04:32:28.269 --> 04:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
know there's three pages four pages of
 
04:32:31.109 --> 04:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
violations here it looks like the most
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
common amount is about
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
$62 um that's failure to dim parking
 
04:32:40.109 --> 04:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
lights failure to Le yield to an
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicle um it looks like
 
04:32:49.469 --> 04:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
lowest okay that gives me an
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
idea um the highest fine on here just
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
for point of reference
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
is um it looks like it's refusing
 
04:33:09.150 --> 04:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
inspection for a DED fuel DED special
 
04:33:14.189 --> 04:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
$40 there certainly wouldn't be many of
 
04:33:20.349 --> 04:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
those I would hope
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
not but as as far as
 
04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
speeding how fast do you have to go and
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.639 --> 04:33:35.690 align:start position:0%
 
meal

04:33:35.690 --> 04:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
meal
 
04:33:35.700 --> 04:33:37.830 align:start position:0%
meal
[Music]

04:33:37.830 --> 04:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:33:40.189 --> 04:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
um how fast
 
04:33:44.349 --> 04:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
for for what the the highest amount to
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
make it not eligible make it not
 
04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
eligible um it looks like so all of that
 
04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
was the change that that occurred all
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
the speeding tickets are now can now be
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
pled by mail it used to be that the
 
04:34:01.629 --> 04:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
highest rat so 21 over or more over the
 
04:34:04.629 --> 04:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
limit those I believe those used to be
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
um uh must appears those have changed so
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
now in a if you're speeding 26
 
04:34:14.949 --> 04:34:14.959 align:start position:0%
miles an hour or more over the limit in
 
04:34:17.551 --> 04:34:17.561 align:start position:0%
a 55 it's a
 
04:34:21.230 --> 04:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
$434 fine in the past that was a must
 
04:34:22.670 --> 04:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
appear at the
 
04:34:22.680 --> 04:34:24.310 align:start position:0%
appear at the
courts

04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
courts
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
questions okay I don't see anybody with
 
04:34:38.429 --> 04:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
raised um do you have anything else
 
04:34:45.789 --> 04:34:45.799 align:start position:0%
to oh
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
yeah uh NOP just I'm available if uh if
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
the committee has any questions
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the process uh we're more
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
than happy to uh to provide any
 
04:34:56.670 --> 04:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
information we have Scott do you have
 
04:35:00.070 --> 04:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
anything else to contribute to
 
04:35:03.510 --> 04:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
this okay again um I have I have nothing
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
else but I mean if it's some questions
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
anybody has i''d be happy to answer them
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
browny looking at the uh uh the two the
 
04:35:16.109 --> 04:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
two numbers for the uh for the two out
 
04:35:19.869 --> 04:35:19.879 align:start position:0%
years so we have uh actually when you
 
04:35:21.470 --> 04:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
add the two together they're they're
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
they're almost identical safety's
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
estimate on fines and judicial branches
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
estimate on fines so if we got 4.5 and
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
4.6 that's
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
9.1 and then when we add the the last
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
year that's 4.8 and 4.1 is 8.9 so you're
 
04:35:40.109 --> 04:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
only off by 0.2 when you add them
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
together so
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know I think one is estimating less
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uh for their reasons and
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
and probably safety you're you're
 
04:35:53.551 --> 04:35:53.561 align:start position:0%
projecting more maybe you're
 
04:35:57.551 --> 04:35:57.561 align:start position:0%
anticipating more of those uh plea by
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
males and and judicial is estimating
 
04:36:04.109 --> 04:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
less less ple by male so so but the
 
04:36:05.750 --> 04:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
estimates come in very close for those
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:10.561 --> 04:36:13.230 align:start position:0%
 
observation

04:36:13.230 --> 04:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
observation
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%
27 uh shows the total
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
revenue going from 238 and 21 to
 
04:36:33.949 --> 04:36:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.869 --> 04:36:40.879 align:start position:0%
flat so represent major if I might so
 
04:36:44.189 --> 04:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
that's includes the um safety estimate
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
on from Seven line
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
17 and then line 28 is the judicial
 
04:36:51.990 --> 04:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
branch um estimates that are on line 18
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
is almost the same Yep they're very
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
close and I just wanted to make sure the
 
04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
committee was aware there was a slight
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
difference between the two estimates I
 
04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
didn't um wasn't trying to create a a
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
bigger issue than might be there but
 
04:37:05.189 --> 04:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
just so that you were aware there might
 
04:37:07.590 --> 04:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
be a slight range
 
04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh any further questions from the
 
04:37:10.520 --> 04:37:13.230 align:start position:0%
okay uh any further questions from the
committee

04:37:13.230 --> 04:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:37:15.990 --> 04:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
stand thenone we want to thank Steve
 
04:37:18.990 --> 04:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
Scott Donner and
 
04:37:22.910 --> 04:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
Maria for coming to prevent present
 
04:37:26.070 --> 04:37:26.080 align:start position:0%

04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you and rep represent major
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
Don is gonna stay on the line and talk
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
to you about the Court's um unrestricted
 
04:37:37.709 --> 04:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
general fund Revenue oh okay yeah so I'm
 
04:37:40.429 --> 04:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
gonna stop this year and put that
 
04:37:40.439 --> 04:37:46.630 align:start position:0%
gonna stop this year and put that
up

04:37:46.630 --> 04:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.640 --> 04:37:53.551 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:37:53.551 --> 04:37:53.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.990 --> 04:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:06.750 --> 04:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
be so when you look at this it's um I
 
04:38:09.070 --> 04:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
column I so those are the court fing
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
fees the unrestricted general fund
 
04:38:10.639 --> 04:38:11.990 align:start position:0%
fees the unrestricted general fund
Revenue

04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
um so if there was any question specific
 
04:38:15.789 --> 04:38:15.799 align:start position:0%
to that Donna would be able to address
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
that for you today she gave a a fair
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
amount of detail in her presentation the
 
04:38:20.400 --> 04:38:21.230 align:start position:0%
amount of detail in her presentation the
other

04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:38:23.949 --> 04:38:23.959 align:start position:0%
day um but I'm sure she's happy to
 
04:38:25.949 --> 04:38:25.959 align:start position:0%
address any questions you
 
04:38:28.750 --> 04:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
have let call
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:40.439 --> 04:38:44.109 align:start position:0%
 
sheets

04:38:44.109 --> 04:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
Donna you want to say anything first
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
us um I guess what I would just say um
 
04:38:53.750 --> 04:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
kind of reiterating what I said in my
 
04:38:57.269 --> 04:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
presentation last week is um this is uh
 
04:39:00.429 --> 04:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
a several different um streams of
 
04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue going into this total that you
 
04:39:08.070 --> 04:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
see and the largest amount um of this is
 
04:39:11.789 --> 04:39:11.799 align:start position:0%
what we call other fees but around 65
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
75% of other fees is uh Records
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
research and that has continued to
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
perform quite strongly um despite the
 
04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic and uh as I had mentioned last
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
week I think New Hampshire's economy has
 
04:39:30.910 --> 04:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
actually fared better than a lot of
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
States uh in the country as a result of
 
04:39:36.029 --> 04:39:36.039 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and we're still seeing a
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
very strong housing market and so we
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
have people calling in to do records
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
checks on people who may be um renting
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
from them we also have people who
 
04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
continue to employ individuals and want
 
04:39:49.750 --> 04:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
to do records checks so that has
 
04:39:52.750 --> 04:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
continued to do quite well for us um
 
04:39:56.430 --> 04:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
another large part of um this revenue is
 
04:40:00.270 --> 04:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
entry fees and entry fees again for the
 
04:40:02.788 --> 04:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
most part was obviously the dip that
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
everybody experienced I think in the
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
last quarter of fiscal year 20 um April
 
04:40:10.750 --> 04:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
through June but after that we sort of
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
saw our turn to normaly um so again that
 
04:40:16.990 --> 04:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
has continued to do quite uh fairly well
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
for us um tring to think if there's any
 
04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
other pieces here bail forfeitures it's
 
04:40:24.550 --> 04:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
tough to say how people are going to
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
behave um obviously that's the people
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
who um pay bail and then don't show up
 
04:40:31.708 --> 04:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
for their court hearing then they
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
forfeit the bail um fines have also um
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
they've gone down a little bit um as a
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
result of the pandemic so I'm seeing I
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
predicted a little bit of an uptick in
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
22 and held it steady in
 
04:40:54.270 --> 04:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
23 so not a lot of change there and some
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the what we report is also default
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
fees collected by safety and those are
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
their figures um so and they've uh
 
04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
continued to project a steady increase
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
um in 21 22 and
 
04:41:09.470 --> 04:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
23 and so that's kind of that's most of
 
04:41:14.190 --> 04:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:23.628 --> 04:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:23.638 --> 04:41:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
committee

04:41:26.390 --> 04:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
representa hen
 
04:41:32.430 --> 04:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
Phillips pH sorry thank you Mr chair I
 
04:41:34.990 --> 04:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up Donna about
 
04:41:37.550 --> 04:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and just see do you
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
have any overall impression about the
 
04:41:43.390 --> 04:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
year toe decline in the number of cases
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
before the courts right now because of
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
covid um as opposed to other years when
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
you haven't had those Court um closures
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
Etc um I do not um that's not the kind
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
of data I usually get into I can
 
04:42:01.708 --> 04:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
certainly look into that for you I my my
 
04:42:04.910 --> 04:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
sense is you know ultimately people's
 
04:42:06.510 --> 04:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
behavior hasn't changed all that much in
 
04:42:08.910 --> 04:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
terms of how litigious they are I think
 
04:42:11.350 --> 04:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
we saw you know there's a couple problem
 
04:42:14.628 --> 04:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
at play here one is um just everybody
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
reacting initially to the pandemic in
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
those first three months the last
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
quarter of fiscal year 20 then we've had
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
you know some issues in terms of jury
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
trials right we've had to be very
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
mindful um of how many of those we can
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
conduct so my sense is there is stuff in
 
04:42:34.350 --> 04:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
the pipeline that needs to get processed
 
04:42:37.110 --> 04:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
I think people are the circuit court is
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
doing better in terms of how much of its
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
staff is out as a result of um you know
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
staff response to co either you know
 
04:42:46.110 --> 04:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
being exposed themselves caring for
 
04:42:47.550 --> 04:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
somebody that type of thing um that's
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
gotten a bit better over the last couple
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
of months and my hope is that as we get
 
04:42:53.190 --> 04:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
warmer uh things will open up a little
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
bit air quality is a big issue with CO
 
04:42:56.708 --> 04:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
as we're finding out now so I'm hoping
 
04:42:59.230 --> 04:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
things will get a little bit better then
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
um we've been working with um an
 
04:43:03.510 --> 04:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist to figure out how we keep
 
04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
our courts um as safe as possible so um
 
04:43:08.670 --> 04:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
there have been times when we've had to
 
04:43:10.350 --> 04:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
cancel jury trials so again there's
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
backlog buil into that um but you know
 
04:43:16.510 --> 04:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that as we get better at this
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
um and also can conduct things remotely
 
04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
we've done a big shift uh to be with
 
04:43:23.070 --> 04:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
WebEx and things to be able to conduct
 
04:43:26.030 --> 04:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
trials remotely but obviously um excuse
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
me to conduct hearings remotely but
 
04:43:29.708 --> 04:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
obviously jury trials you can't quite do
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
that way so it doesn't solve everything
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
but we are you know working through this
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
to find Solutions um and hopefully we
 
04:43:38.270 --> 04:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
will see some of that backlog resolve as
 
04:43:40.830 --> 04:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
a result of it I think it would just be
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
an important correlation to draw if you
 
04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
if you see a 5% docket decrease and
 
04:43:49.670 --> 04:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's also a 5% fine decrease overall
 
04:43:51.788 --> 04:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
right it would make complete sense but
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
right it's hard to know without having
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
that kind of background information
 
04:43:57.390 --> 04:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
right like I said I can certainly ask to
 
04:43:59.470 --> 04:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
see if we can get
 
04:44:02.670 --> 04:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
that for the committee if if you go to
 
04:44:07.030 --> 04:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
page 12 of the report that the Judiciary
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
gave us when they met with us on the
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
12th it has a break out of all the
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
components that make up the $12
 
04:44:20.670 --> 04:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
million and the other that um Donna
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
talked about represents about 40% of
 
04:44:26.070 --> 04:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
their total
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
contribution but page 12 of the document
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
that presented to us on the 26 will show
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.040 --> 04:44:53.868 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.910 --> 04:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
there you
 
04:45:09.948 --> 04:45:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.958 --> 04:45:14.948 align:start position:0%
 
13

04:45:14.948 --> 04:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.590 --> 04:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay we got the same kind of number on
 
04:45:20.430 --> 04:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
page 13 but
 
04:45:25.590 --> 04:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh you can on page 13 it reflects 21 22
 
04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
and 23
 
04:45:34.030 --> 04:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
correct and if you look at the other
 
04:45:39.310 --> 04:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
fees on 20 20 you see those 6.1
 
04:45:44.590 --> 04:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
million and the total to the highway is
 
04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
13.3 so you're talking better than 40%
 
04:45:52.110 --> 04:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
of that has to do with the other fees
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
and the other fees has all
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
those things that you refer to record
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
shacks and ENT Etc so rep of major if I
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
could just interject there you want to
 
04:46:07.350 --> 04:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
take the subtotal line that's that is
 
04:46:09.310 --> 04:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
the court fees that you're counting in
 
04:46:11.868 --> 04:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
that unrestricted um Court's
 
04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
bucket the penalty assessment on the
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
next line down
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
below that's included in the other
 
04:46:21.868 --> 04:46:21.878 align:start position:0%
category the other Revenue
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
category so what Donna has shown you on
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
the sheet is the total unrestricted
 
04:46:28.510 --> 04:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's sent over for the general
 
04:46:31.110 --> 04:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
fund is this amount that I'm
 
04:46:33.270 --> 04:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
highlighting right now but it's in two
 
04:46:33.280 --> 04:46:34.150 align:start position:0%
highlighting right now but it's in two
different

04:46:34.150 --> 04:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:46:37.390 --> 04:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
buckets right so that this line is in
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
the court fees and fines bucket and the
 
04:46:44.548 --> 04:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
assessment line is in the other fund
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
bucket right and then you go up above to
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
the other fee where
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
it's $6
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
million that's the bulk that's the
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
biggest yep
 
04:47:01.310 --> 04:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
correct right yep and that's what Donna
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
started with yep
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a lot of things that
 
04:47:07.440 --> 04:47:08.430 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a lot of things that
make

04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
represent me
 
04:47:18.788 --> 04:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
you I was just on it had been brought up
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
by someone I think that on the courts
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
are going to all electronic for record
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
searches at some point soon and the
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
question is whether you charge for that
 
04:47:34.788 --> 04:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
the I think the person who talked
 
04:47:36.548 --> 04:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
assumed that you didn't charge for the
 
04:47:36.558 --> 04:47:38.230 align:start position:0%
assumed that you didn't charge for the
record

04:47:38.230 --> 04:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:47:41.070 --> 04:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
searches um I don't know who else may
 
04:47:43.030 --> 04:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
have spoken about it I know when I have
 
04:47:44.430 --> 04:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
appeared before house Ways and Means
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
over the last several years I have
 
04:47:50.230 --> 04:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
always brought it up just as to keep it
 
04:47:52.350 --> 04:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh in the back of your minds I have not
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
heard anything uh recently about this
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
becoming um public record search and
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
therefore free of charge um like I said
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
that 6 point you know three or four
 
04:48:07.990 --> 04:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
million about 65 to 75% of that is
 
04:48:10.350 --> 04:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
records research fee so it is a sizable
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
chunk of that amount of money so I I
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
only bring it up um in case something
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
does happen where um that does become uh
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
free of charge that would represent you
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
know around a four four and a half
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
million dollar reduction to the revenues
 
04:48:26.110 --> 04:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
that we would take in but as I said I
 
04:48:31.480 --> 04:48:31.490 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:31.490 --> 04:48:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:48:35.190 --> 04:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
progressing so we have to watch what we
 
04:48:37.628 --> 04:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
do that's
 
04:48:41.390 --> 04:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
right we want to do those things but
 
04:48:45.470 --> 04:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
yeah cause and an effect right
 
04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
right all right any other questions for
 
04:48:48.200 --> 04:48:53.788 align:start position:0%
right all right any other questions for
for

04:48:53.788 --> 04:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
Donna I don't see any hands raises so
 
04:49:00.788 --> 04:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Donna for coming in and going
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%

other and then we'll be through the
 
04:49:34.990 --> 04:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
revenues for for this for the time
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
being this is just so that you can ask
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
questions about the very things that
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
affect the
 
04:49:46.510 --> 04:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
revenues repr major I just want to
 
04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
comment make one quick comment actually
 
04:49:51.670 --> 04:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
two quick comments
 
04:49:55.070 --> 04:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
um the Statewide property tax revenue
 
04:49:57.590 --> 04:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
which is generally accounted for by uh
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
Dr wasn't something they spoke with you
 
04:50:03.548 --> 04:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
about that set statutorily to be um 3
 
04:50:08.350 --> 04:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
363 million. one you sometimes get
 
04:50:11.150 --> 04:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
3632 depending on how the the um
 
04:50:13.350 --> 04:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
calculation goes for valuation but
 
04:50:14.830 --> 04:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's the statutory limit so that
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't discussed and I don't think that
 
04:50:18.190 --> 04:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
there's really a debate unless there's
 
04:50:19.948 --> 04:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
going to be a change to the statute that
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
drives that um that the Statewide
 
04:50:25.110 --> 04:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
property tax so that's why they didn't
 
04:50:26.430 --> 04:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
talk about it and I just but I just want
 
04:50:27.750 --> 04:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
the committee to know it's on the
 
04:50:29.948 --> 04:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
schedule it's on the worksheet as one of
 
04:50:32.350 --> 04:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
your Revenue sources the other is the
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco um settlement I did not invite
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the Attorney General back to discuss
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
that I think he was pretty clear in what
 
04:50:41.548 --> 04:50:41.558 align:start position:0%
he discussed the other day today that he
 
04:50:43.350 --> 04:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
really doesn't have anything to add
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
until sometime in April um when he sees
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
what they're going to get for this
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
year's uh settlement amount and then
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
possibly what impacts might be occurring
 
04:50:56.548 --> 04:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
sense all right any questions from the
 
04:51:01.628 --> 04:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
committee before
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
we Mr chairman do you have on an a date
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be uh trying to put
 
04:51:10.080 --> 04:51:11.590 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be uh trying to put
numbers

04:51:11.590 --> 04:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:51:11.600 --> 04:51:14.430 align:start position:0%
numbers
these

04:51:14.430 --> 04:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I have an estimate but
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's I need to talk sit down and talk
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
with both you and
 
04:51:28.670 --> 04:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
Pat about how we want to proceed on that
 
04:51:30.510 --> 04:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
we still have some questions that we
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
like brought up today we need to
 
04:51:38.990 --> 04:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
bring uh somebody into better so we
 
04:51:41.110 --> 04:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
better understand
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
the co
 
04:51:42.958 --> 04:51:44.830 align:start position:0%
the co
situation

04:51:44.830 --> 04:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:51:46.750 --> 04:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
and what
 
04:51:50.230 --> 04:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
can or can't or could
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
happen and we need to take into account
 
04:51:56.830 --> 04:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
as we do our estimates because that Co
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:01.200 --> 04:52:02.868 align:start position:0%
 
revenues

04:52:02.868 --> 04:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
04:52:05.628 --> 04:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
and I feel it's important to get that
 
04:52:08.190 --> 04:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
information before we finish that but we
 
04:52:12.270 --> 04:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
need to uh
 
04:52:15.628 --> 04:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
we in a good position by the 16th of
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
this month which isn't too far
 
04:52:20.990 --> 04:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
away as I I want to be in a good
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
position before we meet with the
 
04:52:26.910 --> 04:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.230 --> 04:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
18th so
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:52:35.948 --> 04:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
can ask very intelligent questions of
 
04:52:35.958 --> 04:52:37.470 align:start position:0%
can ask very intelligent questions of
him

04:52:37.470 --> 04:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
of why and see if his Revenue estimates
 
04:52:43.070 --> 04:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
are anywhere near
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
what our draft Revenue estimates are at
 
04:52:52.548 --> 04:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.310 --> 04:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
time thank you I think we have a blank
 
04:53:01.070 --> 04:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
week we will be having work
 
04:53:08.350 --> 04:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
sessions and thank
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%

tomorrow

04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:24.350 --> 04:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
time we do know that on this we have
 
04:53:30.990 --> 04:53:31.000 align:start position:0%

do
 
04:54:00.510 --> 04:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
is I can't remember the the number on it
 
04:54:06.750 --> 04:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
it's representative of bram's liquor
 
04:54:10.990 --> 04:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
bill right we want to get that out next
 
04:54:15.628 --> 04:54:15.638 align:start position:0%
uh maybe we can get it out this
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
Thursday because
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh we say that executive sessions may
 
04:54:27.310 --> 04:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
follow on each day that we have public
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
hearings so we have three more days of
 
04:54:33.910 --> 04:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing schedule 4th the 11th and
 
04:54:33.920 --> 04:54:34.628 align:start position:0%
public hearing schedule 4th the 11th and
the

04:54:34.628 --> 04:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:37.150 --> 04:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
17th the 18th will meet with the
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
govern's budget direct dat so now in
 
04:54:41.548 --> 04:54:41.558 align:start position:0%
between that
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
we have work
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
sessions do so and then we also have to
 
04:54:49.948 --> 04:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
meet this committee as a
 
04:54:53.390 --> 04:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
whole on bills thater
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
that uh we need to work on and also as a
 
04:55:00.750 --> 04:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
committee as a
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
whole agree on those bills that we don't
 
04:55:07.590 --> 04:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
need any more information we can either
 
04:55:11.390 --> 04:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as is or
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
itl or op to pass as amended
 
04:55:19.230 --> 04:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
or the amount of work needed we don't
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
have sufficient time we we have to
 
04:55:25.628 --> 04:55:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:29.430 --> 04:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
retained so we need to have time to do
 
04:55:36.788 --> 04:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
those so um knowing all this I have
 
04:55:44.628 --> 04:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
review everybody should be reviewing the
 
04:55:47.948 --> 04:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
bills that we already heard and those
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
that we haven't heard so that when we do
 
04:55:52.830 --> 04:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
have the public hearing they ask the
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
right type of
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions so representative Tucker yes
 
04:56:02.510 --> 04:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh I thought today's been a really good
 
04:56:07.270 --> 04:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
day and I it occurred to me that really
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier to hear when we're all
 
04:56:14.910 --> 04:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
on Zoom from our home offices than it is
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
the hybrid which because of the
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
microphones turned out to be hard for us
 
04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
at home to hear those of you who were in
 
04:56:28.350 --> 04:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
the hearing room and um I just wanted to
 
04:56:31.548 --> 04:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
comment that maybe the microphones could
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
be adjusted in the hearing rooms or
 
04:56:35.868 --> 04:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
maybe we should
 
04:56:38.830 --> 04:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
reconsider whether zooming from home
 
04:56:41.788 --> 04:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
isn't really easier for everybody to
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
hear you know what um that's on my mind
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh talk to the speaker that if uh
 
04:56:53.670 --> 04:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
actually Aaron who's the chief of staff
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
I says if you can't fix those
 
04:56:59.548 --> 04:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
microphones and we should really do our
 
04:56:59.558 --> 04:57:00.510 align:start position:0%
microphones and we should really do our
public

04:57:00.510 --> 04:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:57:00.520 --> 04:57:02.310 align:start position:0%
public
hearings

04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
04:57:02.320 --> 04:57:03.868 align:start position:0%
hearings
by

04:57:03.868 --> 04:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:57:03.878 --> 04:57:05.390 align:start position:0%
by
virtual

04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
virtual
 
04:57:08.430 --> 04:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
yes be nice for you to have the feedback
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
as to those of at home how we're we're
 
04:57:14.590 --> 04:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
perceiving it that's what say I don't
 
04:57:17.708 --> 04:57:17.718 align:start position:0%
mind a bit not having a two-hour Drive
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
each way to him is
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
that what effect is the public hearing
 
04:57:27.070 --> 04:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
people can't hear
 
04:57:31.390 --> 04:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
people it's it's a waste and so uh what
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
I was veering to is is holding a public
 
04:57:39.030 --> 04:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
hearings virtually now today they had to
 
04:57:41.708 --> 04:57:41.718 align:start position:0%
hold the public hearing
 
04:57:44.190 --> 04:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
and that's a good excuse to continuing
 
04:57:47.788 --> 04:57:47.798 align:start position:0%
it so I'm I'm I'm working on that well
 
04:57:49.868 --> 04:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
04:57:53.910 --> 04:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
much Norm when you Norm yes one option
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
is to actually everybody who shows if
 
04:57:58.948 --> 04:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
they want to be there in person bring
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
your laptop with
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
you and and use that and and turn off
 
04:58:05.788 --> 04:58:05.798 align:start position:0%
the microphones other than the one that
 
04:58:09.510 --> 04:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
we use on the table for the people to
 
04:58:10.548 --> 04:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's rare that someone's going to
 
04:58:14.590 --> 04:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
testify uh in person um other than a rep
 
04:58:17.150 --> 04:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's around they're the only ones that
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
can testify turn up the microphones
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
because the problem we had was that it
 
04:58:20.638 --> 04:58:21.510 align:start position:0%
because the problem we had was that it
was

04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
feedback I had my I had my laptop turned
 
04:58:26.150 --> 04:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
on and it was too close to a microphone
 
04:58:28.310 --> 04:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
and was getting feedback so if we turn
 
04:58:29.910 --> 04:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
off the microphones and just all use our
 
04:58:31.270 --> 04:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
laptops then you could say well why do
 
04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
we even go there uh it was just a
 
04:58:36.190 --> 04:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
camaraderie for those of us who were
 
04:58:38.430 --> 04:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
there I kind of enjoyed the fact that I
 
04:58:40.590 --> 04:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
I met some couple of the new members
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
we had a chance to
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
chat um I mean other than that I I tend
 
04:58:46.590 --> 04:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
to agree you know we could probably
 
04:58:48.310 --> 04:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish this without without going
 
04:58:52.390 --> 04:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
there physically but uh I did enjoy I
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
enjoyed the com comaraderie in between
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
things thank you I agree with you but if
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
people can't hear they can't understand
 
04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
and it's a
 
04:59:05.070 --> 04:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
waste no I'm agreeing with you Norm but
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh U I think I think one one
 
04:59:09.788 --> 04:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
way we can hit handle this is if you're
 
04:59:11.830 --> 04:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
going to show up use your laptop turn
 
04:59:12.990 --> 04:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
off the
 
04:59:15.910 --> 04:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
microphones so that so that there's no
 
04:59:19.628 --> 04:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
feedback um is is what I'm suggesting
 
04:59:20.830 --> 04:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe you could talk to Aon well
 
04:59:22.868 --> 04:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
we'll talk offline about this right and
 
04:59:26.270 --> 04:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's very and it's also difficult some
 
04:59:28.948 --> 04:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
people have desktops they don't have
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
laptops I'm one of
 
04:59:34.750 --> 04:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
those I don't have also some some of us
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
with laptops don't have enough battery
 
04:59:40.948 --> 04:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
power that we could survive the meeting
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
I I you know what I did repres Ami I
 
04:59:47.548 --> 04:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
brought my own extension cord and U and
 
04:59:50.310 --> 04:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
strip and plugged
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
in there's actually they they did
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
provide some additional uh extension
 
04:59:56.070 --> 04:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
cords for this St because there's only a
 
04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
couple outlets in the in the room and I
 
05:00:05.910 --> 05:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
heavy that I couldn't bring it and and
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
trying to conduct a meeting with an iPad
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
very small it's not
 
05:00:18.510 --> 05:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
easy well anyway I just thought I'd
 
05:00:21.070 --> 05:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
bring it up be I thought you'd like
 
05:00:24.030 --> 05:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
hearing the feedback and think a public
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
hearing it's nice to be able to hear I
 
05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
think tonight I'll I'll hear how well
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
today went for those that had to conduct
 
05:00:35.350 --> 05:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
all their meetings virtually
 
05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
today and and see how that
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
did but you're right it would be nice if
 
05:00:46.350 --> 05:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
we could meet but I've got SLS of
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
grandchildren great grandchildren I
 
05:00:50.430 --> 05:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
can't even see them
 
05:00:54.110 --> 05:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
anymore or neighbors and friends and
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:02.708 --> 05:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
so uh anything
 
05:01:05.868 --> 05:01:05.878 align:start position:0%
else oh if
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
