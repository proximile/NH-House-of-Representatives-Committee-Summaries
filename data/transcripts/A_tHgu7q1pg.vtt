00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
started and I will open the public
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
chair because this bill
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
deals probably more with education
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
funding than with the taxation part I'm
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to begin with um some information
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
about the Statewide property tax and how
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
that is used for school funding just so
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
you get a back background of that
 
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
um you and there's a good description of
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
how it works in this handout that I that
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
I gave to everybody it's a two-page
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
document prepared by reaching higher the
 
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
date on it is 20 19 so its description
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
of the school funding formula re refers
 
00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
to a stabilization Grant the formula has
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
changed a little bit since then but in
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
terms of the principle of understanding
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
how the Statewide property tax is used
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
for Education funding Remains the
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
Same so 25 years ago the Supreme Court
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
ruled that the state need needed to
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
significantly increase f funding to
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
school districts the state quickly put
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
together a new funding plan that on
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
paper showed a significant increase in
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
state funding part of that increase was
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
simply taking each
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
Town's property tax assessment for
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
schools and breaking it into two
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
pieces one piece remained the local
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
property tax and the new piece was
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
labeled state educ ation property
 
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
tax the total property taxation for
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
schools did not
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
change no new Revenue was raised from
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
property tax because the sum of those
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
two pieces was the same as the original
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
amount swep has been simply a mechanism
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount of real money the
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
state must send to school districts swep
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
exist only on
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
paper actual money doesn't CH change
 
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
hands and it's been referred to as a
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.069 align:start position:0%
 
mirrors

00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
so this is why I introduced the bill for
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
two reasons for several reasons one has
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
transparency since the money doesn't
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
really come to the state or uh come flow
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
into the state flow out of the state
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
because it's was and continues to be
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
state it continues to be local property
 
00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:13.710 align:start position:0%
state it continues to be local property
tax

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
um repealing the state property
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
tax uh adds transparency to the
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
situation and the way that I do it with
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is revenue neutral it has no
 
00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
schools the other consideration is that
 
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.509 align:start position:0%
schools the other consideration is that
given

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
that let's
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
see another consideration is the school
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
funding lawsuit that has already had a
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
lower Court ruling that says the state
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
needs to increase funding to education
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
and it's being appealed to the Supreme
 
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
Court but there's a reasonably good
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
chance that the state will have to
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
increase school funding and when this
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
happens I hope that it does not
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
include increasing the burden on
 
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.110 align:start position:0%
include increasing the burden on
property

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh repealing the swept tax
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
would Ure
 
00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:28.839 align:start position:0%
that so my purpose in filing this bill
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
is that political subdivisions of the
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
state are responsible for raising most
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
of the revenue needed to Sure ensure an
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
environment that allows residents to
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
live safe healthy productive lives
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
servic is essential to this Duty include
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
police police and fire protection
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%

homes Clean Water waste management and
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
more subdivisions of the state have
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
limited options on how to raise revenue
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
as you know they um political
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions can only do what the state
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
gives them authority to
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
do and because of that uh political
 
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.550 align:start position:0%
do and because of that uh political
subdivision

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
00:16:33.069 --> 00:16:33.079 align:start position:0%
rely primarily on the local property tax
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
to fund all of these
 
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.150 align:start position:0%
to fund all of these
Services

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
therefore uh this bill gives the
 
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
therefore uh this bill gives the
political

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
subdivision the exclusive right to tax
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
property uh there is an ex the exclusion
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
of two
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
taxes uh the railroad tax and the
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
utility tax because those properties
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
evaluated in the same manner that's used
 
00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.870 align:start position:0%
evaluated in the same manner that's used
to

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
evaluate regular um buildings real
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
estate and uh home homes and businesses
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
thing so by repealing the Statewide
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
property tax which is what this bill
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
does it will prevent the state from
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
increasing the rate of the Statewide
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
property tax enforcing the property
 
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to pay even a greater share of
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
what it costs to operate the local
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
schools compared to other states New
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Property Owners pay the
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
highest percentage of costs for K12
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
education they pay 70% of the
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
cost the federal government pays about
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
10 and the state pays
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
20 if if the prop Statewide property tax
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
increases what will happen is property
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
taxes will pay even a higher
 
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.390 align:start position:0%
taxes will pay even a higher
percent

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
so have to excuse me I
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
laryngitis so I can go over the sections
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
bill you see in section one is that
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
exclusion for the railroad and the
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
utilities that I told you
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
about I'm going to skip down to section
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
4 um the repeal date the date to repeal
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
it is December
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
2024 which means that the change would
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
occur on the November 2025 property tax
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
bills they would not see the swept
 
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.549 align:start position:0%
bills they would not see the swept
tax

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
um what I would expect to see except for
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
those little places that have no student
 
00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.630 align:start position:0%
those little places that have no student
at

00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
all some of them don't even have any
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
population what it this really is not
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
going to have any impact on um the tax
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
bills it won't make their tax bill go up
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
or down what will happen is the two the
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
local what what is now the local and the
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
state line will just be merged together
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
in one line because for all places
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
except for those really tiny
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
ones what they pay for schools is more
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
than what the state gives them in
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
grant and let's
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
see so that's a um that's when that is
 
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.789 align:start position:0%
see so that's a um that's when that is
repealed

00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
section section the second part of
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
section four that has to do with the low
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
and moderate income
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
what will happen with that is the they
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
will be able to apply for the last Grant
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
will be um a rebate from their November
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
2024 Property Tax Bill and they apply
 
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.230 align:start position:0%
2024 Property Tax Bill and they apply
for

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
2025 so the expir date allows for time
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:35.710 align:start position:0%
 
finish

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
so even though the Statewide property
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
tax is really only on paper it's just an
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
accounting it's just a a
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
phantom tax it
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
does have an impact on school
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
funding because that Statewide property
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
tax is used as an element in the school
 
00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
tax is used as an element in the school
funding

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
formula the formula um which is it it's
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
explained um in this handout
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
too the formula determines what is the
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education for the
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.269 --> 00:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
district and then it
 
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:20.919 align:start position:0%
subtracts from that amount that the
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
state owes the state owes the adequate
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
education for the students that live in
 
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.590 align:start position:0%
education for the students that live in
that

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
District to pay that to the
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
towns first thing that happens is the
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
formula subtracts the swep that they see
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
on their property tax bill and then it
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
gives the the municipalities a grant
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
which is equal to the difference and
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's called a grant that's money that
 
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
that's called a grant that's money that
really

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
goes back to the it goes to the school
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
district um and is a credit for um the
 
00:21:59.789 --> 00:21:59.799 align:start position:0%
municip ality which in the case of a
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
co-op there are multiple municipalities
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
district so what I do in this bill is I
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
take that swep amount which for many
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
years has
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
been $363 million
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
Statewide and I freeze it in the
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid formula
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
me so it's still used the fan this the
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula it doesn't change those
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.390 align:start position:0%
 
rest

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
rest
 
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.950 align:start position:0%
rest
line

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
21 through 28 of this
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill are not really
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
all um it makes a
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
correction that it corrects a problem in
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 that
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
deleted a paragraph that allows the
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
department of educas to send grants to
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
small school
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
districts that's kind of
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
housekeeping that is also in another
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill I discovered it when I was drafting
 
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.669 align:start position:0%
bill I discovered it when I was drafting
this

00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
one so are there any
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
questions do you want to answer any
 
00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.870 align:start position:0%
questions do you want to answer any
questions

00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative PL yes thank you for
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question I understand that
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
you're just essentially doing a way you
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
swept but keeping the obligation there
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
did you find it did you uh include any
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
kind of alternate tax to co cover that
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
363 million the the whole the whole
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
point of this is
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
that there is there there there is no
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
cost to the
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.549 align:start position:0%
cost to the
state

00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
no new Revenue to the state because that
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue was only on paper to begin
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
with I know it's an odd concept because
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
you're used to taxes but it's been like
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
this for 20 more than 20 years follow up
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
follow up then you're saying it goes
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
back to the way it was it's all from the
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
local property
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer it go yeah I I think I think I
 
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
think that's what you're asking it goes
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
back to be just like like it was before
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
they created the swep almost 25 years
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
ago representative
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
Aly yes uh isn't the main difference
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
that the um so-called donor communities
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
will be off the hook
 
00:25:23.389 --> 00:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh because every town will be uh
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
completely in charge of its own own tax
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
rate but it does doesn't as you say it
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect all of the towns that we
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
and all the other places that are dying
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
under really high property taxes will
 
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
also be donor towns um uh yes so so if I
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
can yeah can I can just address now that
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
I have a little bit of a voice coming
 
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.430 align:start position:0%
I have a little bit of a voice coming
back

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
on back side of what I was just reading
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
oh did I is an example of what happens
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
doubled I didn't I didn't get that one
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
oh maybe because I'm not in my own seat
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
oh that's because you're oh you're
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
sitting in the seat that I thought was
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
going to be vacant that's why yeah
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's right I she's trying to avoid I
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
want to avoid getting coal for this
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
weekend yeah so the like the
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.669 align:start position:0%
weekend yeah so the like the
first

00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
the two the two
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
like for two different
 
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
bium so to get the point you you we can
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
Column the this is a this is a scenario
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
that would say what what if the state
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
had to had to have this is not a
 
00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.110 align:start position:0%
had to had to have this is not a
proposed

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's just a an
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
illustration what if the state had to
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
raise the base cost per pupil from the
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
$4,100 it is now up to$
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
6,000 and then thought that maybe a good
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
way to pay for that would be just to
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
double the Statewide property
 
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
tax what this shows you is
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
that given the thinking from 2 5 years
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
ago it says look the state is
 
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.909 align:start position:0%
ago it says look the state is
paying

00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:36.919 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
see what with the current base per pupil
 
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
the state is
 
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.110 align:start position:0%
the state is
paying

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.990 align:start position:0%
paying
um

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
which oh okay the the the first line the
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
adequacy state like right now the state
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
is pay con calculates its cost of an
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
adequate education to be $810
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
million if the if the base cost goes up
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
to $6,000 the cost of adequacy would be
 
00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:19.509 align:start position:0%
to $6,000 the cost of adequacy would be
$1.1

00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
$1.1
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
billion double A Statewide property tax
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
and what happens the real money that
 
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
goes to towns which is the line that
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
says total grants goes
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
down that's because the property tax
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
payers are going to be covering that
 
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:42.549 align:start position:0%
payers are going to be covering that
whole

00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
increase so this that's what this bill
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to prevent that
 
00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.350 align:start position:0%
this bill is intended to prevent that
from

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
happening it does it in a re Revenue
 
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.389 align:start position:0%
happening it does it in a re Revenue
neutral

00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
way a followup followup well the problem
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
that I could you put the microphone a
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
closer my hearing a is in my pocketbook
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
oh my uh the problem opinion on
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
something so that can be done but they
 
00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to give their
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
know is that on a scenario like this if
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
increased funding is
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
being if increased Aid
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
school is being funded by increasing the
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
property tax rate to some extent you're
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
not helping property taxpayers at all in
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
school funding and property taxpayers
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
those two issues go
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
thing any other
 
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
Ames trying to get this really
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
close for your sake um so if uh swept
 
00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:05.230 align:start position:0%
close for your sake um so if uh swept
goes

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
away it the obligation to raise that
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
money goes away too and there's no
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
obligation at the local level to raise
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
replace the the reduction is that
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
true so I I I wouldn't say I wouldn't uh
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
away I'd say swep on does not appear on
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
the property tax bill because what has
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
been swept for 25 years is going to go
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
back into the line with local property
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
tax which is where it was before swep
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
was created but and then and then that's
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
like swept on the property tax side
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
swept in the school funding formula is
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
staying there the numbers are being
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
frozen in there and used in this so the
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
calculation of the actual grants doesn't
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
change at
 
00:31:18.149 --> 00:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
all okay well that's another question
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
then excuse me follow up yeah
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
um you've got numbers in
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
there very each
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
town and
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
um they're there without any formula as
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
far as I can see so so essentially we're
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
stuck into as the years go by unless the
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
legislature changes those
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
amounts with the amounts that were
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
identified excuse me I'm trying to
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
question the numbers identified there
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
will continue on they they're derived
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
from from a year or two ago and um have
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
no footing in a formula they're just
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
filling a gap um and
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
formula so the numbers that are in there
 
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
you're right they're from like three
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
years ago they're based on equalized
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
ago what is sign ific is not so much
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
what the number is but that just each
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
363 for 20 for 20 years the 363 million
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
Chang if you wanted you could update
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
those equalized
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
valuations and distributed them
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
proportion you could you could take
 
00:32:59.039 --> 00:33:00.990 align:start position:0%
proportion you could you could take
$363

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
$363
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
million and distribute it proportionally
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
to all the municipalities based on their
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation which is exactly
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
that what's in there now you could redo
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
that every single year it would be
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
thing representative spillsbury
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to have
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
to read all this much more carefully
 
00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
afterwards and be sure I've digested it
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
but unless I misunderstanding this this
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
isn't actually a repeal of the $363
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
million obligation it's just a shifting
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
it's uh kind of a relabeling it's it's
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
striking me as more like a truth and
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
advertising Bill we want to make it
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
clear that it's still the taxpayer
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
through the municipal assessment that
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
has to raise the money but it does
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
nothing to alleviate the uh burden on
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
the real tax real property
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I would be very much in favor
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
of a repeal of swept but that doesn't
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
seem to be what this bill is so I I I I
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
agree with everything you
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
say it's
 
00:34:21.149 --> 00:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
not it's
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
repealing it's not
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
repealing well I don't it's not
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
repealing really doesn't repeal a tax
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
because the tax does isn't really there
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
it was always the local property tax
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
anyway so it is truth in advertising so
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
so my my characterization of a a it's a
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
truth and advertising Bill isn't it
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
really it's a labeling well it is that
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
it is that but the second thing it is is
 
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.550 align:start position:0%
it is that but the second thing it is is
it

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
stops the possibility of expanding it
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
and putting even more of the burden onto
 
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and and also I mean it's
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue neutral made it Revenue neutral
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
for a reason because I didn't want to
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
get in like well how how are you going
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
else just to recapitulate what you said
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
I think what this comes down to is it's
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
motivated to
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
prevent an increase in the swept
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
obligation from the 363 it is now is
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
you yes representative ORS thank you Mr
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I definitely agree
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
with what representative Aly said
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
earlier about this would take some of
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
the towns off the hook that have the
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
money to donate and put into the
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
schools uh I'm also in favor of either
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
keeping swep or eliminating it depending
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
on how this would work out I also
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
believe in funding the schools properly
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
are you in favor well let me rephrase
 
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.270 align:start position:0%
are you in favor well let me rephrase
the

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
question student enrollment is going
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
down yet the cost per student in a
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
multi-district I I went through the
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
swept presentation that Doug Hall was
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
there and John and I forget the young
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
man Zachary I think yes and they had
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
some great points but student enrollment
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
is down the cost is going up it's in the
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
multi school districts
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
14k it's we know it's somewhere around
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
19 to 21k in most schools per student
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
cost per
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
student what do you proposed to level
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
this out in terms of it's not
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable to keep raising the price to
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
cost per student so is there a way in
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
your package in your idea or can this be
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
amended to somehow cap the cost per
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
student and get all these towns the
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
in so right now there are no towns that
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
are pay are paying in for um way back 20
 
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.589 align:start position:0%
are pay are paying in for um way back 20
years

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
ago there for maybe two years there were
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
the part of the swept back to the
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
state that was highly unpopular and the
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
legislature stopped
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
it excuse
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
me followup follow up just not in I'm
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
I'm taking she's taking a break I'm
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
sorry oh
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay and keep in mind we're going to
 
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
have to we're going to have a work
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
session on this as well a as for your
 
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
the thought
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
that one thing to remember is that there
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
no one thing to remember is the current
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
cost of adequacy and what the state pays
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
does not come close to what it costs to
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
operate the
 
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
schools and then hand out it tells you
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the state property taxpayers are
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
paying 70% of what it costs to operate
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
the schools and no other state expects
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers to pay that
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
amount State needs to step up to its
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
obligation and the towns that were the
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
so-called donor
 
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
towns those towns that that money that
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're ask suggesting they might send
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
back is money that they are using to
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
operate their
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
schools because the adequate cost is
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
we're saying cost of adequacy that's the
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
state's idea of cost of adequacy that's
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
not the true cost of what it costs to
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
operate the
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
schools follow thank you so uh I
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that this needs to be
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
fixed and I think that we all need to
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
get get together and and fix
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
this the one thing I I need to point out
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
is and I want to see if you agree with
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
me the co the rising cost of education
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
is not sustainable do you agree with
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
that I I'm not here to talk about that
 
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is about Statewide property
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
tax and you it would be good there are
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
plenty of school funding
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
bills that that it would be appropriate
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
for you to to to suggest how to change a
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
formula to deal with that or how to
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
change what the state does in terms of
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education um to
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
address that issue okay thank you so I
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
would I would request follow up thank
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
you followup I would just request you
 
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
talk to Doug Hall Zachary or John who
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
did the swep presentation I gave them
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
the answer on how to fix this so I won't
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
go through it here but if you talk to
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
them hopefully they they reprentative is
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
there a question there yeah so uh would
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
you please do that are you willing to do
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
that I I've heard all of their their
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
talk and they're not and they're not
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
proposing I so I believe what you're
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion that some of the
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
towns that have high
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
property tax bases return money to the
 
00:40:55.839 --> 00:40:57.589 align:start position:0%
property tax bases return money to the
state

00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
the amount if they had done that like
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
this year would be something like $29
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
million that is a drop in the bucket of
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
schools representative Aly U just two
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
points of clarification which um one of
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
them is I think what you said is that
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
the towns could decide to merge the on
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
their education rate with the local
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
property tax contribution and just have
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
one line as it used to be on the
 
00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.230 align:start position:0%
one line as it used to be on the
ballot

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
um but then other towns would be not
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
passes

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
beginning with um the
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
bills what would happen is what it it
 
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be that they could choose it's
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
that's would be what would happen Okay
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
because they'd still re need to the same
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
money and they just have one line to put
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
it on and and um I think at the bottom
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
of one of my handout it says
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
that I can
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
do I need an amendment to deal with
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
towns that have property tax
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
caps it just and that will just need to
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
say that when tax caps they look at the
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
tax rate one year and it can only go up
 
00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:50.549 align:start position:0%
tax rate one year and it can only go up
so

00:42:50.549 --> 00:42:50.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
much when they do that for
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
2025 they have have to add together the
 
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
24 swep and local and compare that
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
number to what they
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
propose could I just have the second one
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
here on this this is something that
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
escaped me if you what what you're
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
saying is that the um percentage of the
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
equalized uh annual valuation for each
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
town in F y 11 when they set the tax
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
rate at the swept tax rate at
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
363 million uh with the intention of
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
doing what they did which is reduce it
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
to less and less of the cost of
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
Education um that
 
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.270 align:start position:0%
Education um that
that

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
2011 equalized annual valuation is still
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
being used so that the towns that have
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
grown their number of children are
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
getting less per student than the towns
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
population

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
um no uh for just for the
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
record that
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
363 was established in 20
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
2005 not 2011 I don't know I've heard
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
that repeated that's not
 
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.109 align:start position:0%
that repeated that's not
correct

00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
but all that three $363 million that's
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
used in the formula all every year
 
00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.470 align:start position:0%
used in the formula all every year
is

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
just it's just using all it does is it
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
just reduces the amount of actual money
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
the state has to send to the school
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
districts I'm not I don't I don't really
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
understand maybe I don't understand what
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
your question was are they
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
recalculating uh the
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
annual equal equal annualized um
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
valuation yeah every year as I assumed
 
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.750 align:start position:0%
valuation yeah every year as I assumed
they

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
were and I can't quite remember now that
 
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:20.559 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about it whether it was so
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is how this is this is how the swep
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
amount is determined for each
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
municipality you take the equalized
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
valuation for the whole
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
state and look at each municipality and
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
said say their equalized valuation is
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
what percent of the whole state if it's
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
1% of the whole state then their swep is

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
things can can we move these

00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
on I just wiped all right remind me to
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
wipe again while I'm leaving let's start
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
from the beginning again if you'd
 
00:49:09.839 --> 00:49:13.190 align:start position:0%
from the beginning again if you'd
introduce

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
yourself my name is Bruce canu I'm the
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the municipal Bureau at
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue uh the team I work
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
with uh helps calculate for the
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner the property tax rates
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
including uh the swept
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
rate um I as I was saying I think there
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
were two names uh Revenue Council Wong
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
was going to speak as well but had to
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
attend some other um meeting or hearing
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
so I will uh handle what questions and
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
and so forth that I can and uh defer
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
anything else back to to
 
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
him um the department um spoke with the
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsor representative fellows uh
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
prior to this hearing we had
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
identified at least one technical issue
 
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:07.799 align:start position:0%
as we read the bill uh the repeal of
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
rsa's 763 and
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
768 on December 1st of this year
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
2024 um would effectively
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate what would have normally been
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh the preparation of the swept warrant
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
out to the
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
2025 uh that being said without a
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
warrant to collect what is the swept tax
 
00:50:40.799 --> 00:50:41.870 align:start position:0%
warrant to collect what is the swept tax
in

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
2025 we then identified something I
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
believe representative fellows may end
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
up addressing uh with uh an amendment
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
which is currently and most of the state
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
of New New Hampshire uses semiannual
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
property tax billing so there is a first
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
bill issued payable July 1st I think
 
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:06.799 align:start position:0%
every most people here are familiar with
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
that by law RSA
 
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
76 col
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
15-a uh those
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
bills utilize one half of the respective
 
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.950 align:start position:0%
bills utilize one half of the respective
20

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
24 tax
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
rates this is implemented in the
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities as as the taxing
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
Authority if you will and collecting
 
00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
agent that would be a a bit of a
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
conundrum if we do not produce a 2025
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
set of warrants out to the
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities for a swept
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
tax the municipalities would be faced
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
with trying to comply with the law to
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
utilize last year's swept
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
2025 with no warrant ultimately to
 
00:52:09.549 --> 00:52:09.559 align:start position:0%
collect any swept taxes in 2025 so those
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
two sections of Statute would probably
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
possibility I should have stated the
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
obvious which is that the department
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
takes no position on the bill
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
um I as as an aside I just wanted to
 
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:31.720 align:start position:0%
clarify something that uh representative
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
Aly had just spoken to a few minute just
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
a couple minutes ago um one I will
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
confirm that it was the
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2005 is when the $363
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
million figure was placed into the
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
statute and has remained that way
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
since um also the sequence of events
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
that lead to the um apportionment of
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
that 363 million that becomes the
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
warrants to each of the 259
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities is accomplished in the
 
00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559 align:start position:0%
following way um at during the fall of
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
2022 uh I'll use the most recent example
 
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
every municipality is reporting to the
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue a summary of its
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
locally assessed values that report's
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
referred to as the
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
ms1 um we utilize that the summary
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
numbers from that report in the
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
production of the tax rates in the fall
 
00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.030 align:start position:0%
production of the tax rates in the fall
of

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
2022 uh after those reports are approved
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
a process begins by our Equalization
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
Bureau and takes until May of
 
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
2023 to complete so in May of 2023 we
 
00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
now now have the equalized property
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
values of all 259
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities when you sum them up you
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
have the equalized value of 2022 for the
 
00:54:08.359 --> 00:54:09.829 align:start position:0%
have the equalized value of 2022 for the
entire

00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
entire
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
State we common siize that so that
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
starting with aworth we know exactly out
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
to I believe 15 decimal places what
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
percentage of the states
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:25.589 align:start position:0%
percentage of the states
2022

00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
um equalized valuation is attributable
 
00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.309 align:start position:0%
um equalized valuation is attributable
to

00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
aworth and we derive that percentage and
 
00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
then apply it to the 363
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
million dollar or in the case of swept
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature has given us authority
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
to have a swept rate out to a half penny
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's very unusual looking for that state
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
rate that's so that we can guarantee
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
that the tax rate the swept tax rate for
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
the state will call for at least 363
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
million it will always be over that and
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's how we end up with the dollar
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
amounts that would be on the warrants
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
that would go to each of the
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities the
 
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
municipalities the
2024

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
warrants were created in September of
 
00:55:16.839 --> 00:55:18.030 align:start position:0%
warrants were created in September of
last

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
year we do that early we have until
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
December 15th per the statute that gu
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
um U the commissioner of
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
Dr however the Department of Education
 
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
each year needs the swept number by
 
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
November 1st pursuant to another Statute
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
in the education chapter so we um derive
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
and produce them earlier so that those
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
numbers are available for for education
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
so right now um in the municipalities
 
00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
they have have received the
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
warrant you know effective April 1 of
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
this this year they're they're ordered
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
to collect the dollar amount in swept
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
taxes there was a lot of background to
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
the conundrum I I um
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
identified with the bill as written is
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
that we would not be producing
 
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
2025 swept warrants if this if this bill
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
law thank you that was uh very helpful
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
to understand um do we have any
 
00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
questions representative spillsbury um
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Bruce as usual very careful
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
clear um explanations and I appreciate
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
that so if if I'm understanding this
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
technical issue is a one-time
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
transitional issue
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
yes it it would it would leave in place
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
most of those two statutes so that the
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities would in continue to do
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
what they do take one half of the TW in
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
this case the 2024 tax rates but it
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
would identify the need to
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
disregard the the last what would be the
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
last swept rate you'd see it on the
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
bills of this fall um just so that they
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
don't face that problem of trying to
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
obey a law that would well would create
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
them represent
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
elme thank you uh this is something
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
different we haven't discussed before
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
the uh removal of the low and moderate
 
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
proper property tax relief program on
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
your division must be the ones that
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
administer that yes um representative
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
Aly no um I wish um Revenue Council was
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
here uh Kean was prepared to talk about
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
that section of the bill the municipal
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
Bureau itself really has no involvement
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
with L and moderate a as a bureau so I'm
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
Ill prepared to talk about that do you
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
do you know who
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
does um
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
I I want to say that the equalization
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
Bureau had some input on that but I'm
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
not clear on that I think that um I'm
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
happy to uh tell Keen that we need to
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
get you an answer or if there are if
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a work session on
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
the bill that would be good because this
 
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
program has been suffering from lack of
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
use since it was started and there were
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
attempts long ago um to try to get the
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
Dr when uh commissioner Platos was still
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
there to try to get uh the Dr to
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
um talk with the municipalities or
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
language that we could put into the law
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities to say you have to
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
provide these indicators in the tax bill
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
um so that uh people would know that the
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
program existed that and whether they
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
could use it or
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
not uh and since the swept is so low it
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of people aren't using it at this
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
point but it'd be interesting to
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
knowen to it so your question is can we
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
get can we get clarity Clarity from Keen
 
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
or okay someone all right that's
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
administering it that'd be great and and
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
we will obviously take this up in a work
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
session any other
 
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
just give me a moment to wipe down for
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
next is there anyone else who'd like to
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill 15 HP
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
1563 seeing none I will close the public
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:30.270 align:start position:0%
 
1563

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
you okay we will open the public hearing
 
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.470 align:start position:0%
you okay we will open the public hearing
on

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.750 align:start position:0%
on
HB

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
1558 and I'll first call up
 
01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
bill good morning Mr chairman good
 
01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
morning committee how are you
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
all this is uh HP 1558 just a couple
 
01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:58.750 align:start position:0%
all this is uh HP 1558 just a couple
small

01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
changes uh we're talking about the agent
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
fee so this is when the hunter goes or a
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
fisherman goes to a store and they want
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
to get a license from the state of New
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they charge a dollar for the
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
agent fee for doing the the paperwork
 
01:01:12.359 --> 01:01:13.349 align:start position:0%
agent fee for doing the the paperwork
and

01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot it only used to take a pen to
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
write a a
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
license today you need internet you have
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
to have paper
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
cartridges the expenses
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
have increased
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
significantly so we want to give more
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
money to the stores writing the fees
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's what that
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
does any questions about that part of it
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward yeah a PL
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
yeah we talking small money but uh is
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
there any basis for the $3 or is it just
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
out of the air the basis has always been
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
it's always been a dollar for writing it
 
01:01:50.349 --> 01:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
and fishing game always provided a book
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
and they would write the license out of
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
a book today you have to go on the
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
internet so you have to have internet
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
for your store you have to have a
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
printer for your store you have to have
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
a computer for your store there's
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
legitimate expenses and it's been this
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
way I've been in New Hampshire my whole
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
life I'm 52 it's always been a dollar
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
since I've hunted so it's a long time
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's been that way for an awful long
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
time okay you you you want to continue
 
01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
sure the second part was requested by
 
01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:22.039 align:start position:0%
chairman Spain of fishing game there was
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
some concern at the way stations of
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
overcharging hunters for weighing game
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
so he wanted to establish set
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
amounts he was here earlier but you ran
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
a little long in your
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
last uh bill so he didn't get to testify
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
he will be back down if you have any
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions for him but again that pretty
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
straightforward does anybody have any
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
questions about that portion of it
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yes repres thank you uh doesn't
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
this incentivize the hunters to not
 
01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
this incentivize the hunters to not
weigh

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
weigh
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
in but instead skip the weighing in
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
process and thereby save themselves 10
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
bucks no because I think the concern is
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
if it's an out ofate Hunter and say they
 
01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
get a deer some of the stations would
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
charge them maybe $50 for weighing the
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
deer which is just not in it's not
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate it's really protecting the
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
consumer I don't think this is anything
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
that's discouraging it so this is
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
actually cutting down what they may Char
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
cor this is this is stopping that
 
01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
behavior from happening by setting these
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
limits thank you so I know you need the
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
statistics from that I'd like to just
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
ask you a question
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
um these these rates can these rates be
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
set by The Fishing Game Commission or
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
are these in statute and and these would
 
01:03:47.549 --> 01:03:47.559 align:start position:0%
be in Statute in the RS no I know these
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be in statute but right now can
 
01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
fishing game set it to whatever it wants
 
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
to be or how does that work no not no
 
01:03:57.309 --> 01:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
not in that instance there's there's no
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
law setting the fees for weighing at
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
this time that's why fishing game
 
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:04.839 align:start position:0%
chairman had asked me to add it to this
 
01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
bill I see okay representative PL yes
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
I'm looking up the bill again I I'm
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
looking up the bill again but I remember
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
language that if they don't use the
 
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
waste Station they don't have to pay
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct so why would they not AR
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
they use required to use the waste
 
01:04:24.029 --> 01:04:24.039 align:start position:0%
Station no they're not required to but
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
those that do some of have been taken
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
advantage of and this is to stop that
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
hey what do they do weigh the deer
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
themselves and just report it they don't
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
no they would just check in the deer not
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Ellery uh just
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
to follow up on representative pletz and
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
and your response it's been my
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
experience that certain stations will
 
01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
charge you for the scale use
 
01:04:59.230 --> 01:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
use but you're being charged for it
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
because you went there oh to register
 
01:05:04.079 --> 01:05:06.789 align:start position:0%
because you went there oh to register
the

01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
animal this would eliminate that
 
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
particular type of consumer abuse is
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
that correct that would eliminate that
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
would representa Aly thank you uh just
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
for the people that don't know much
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
about hunting uh could you
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
explain on the kinds of Statistics that
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
you need to collect from the way
 
01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
stations to look at the health of the
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
deer population anytime
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
you get a deer in New Hampshire you have
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
to bring it to a way station so it can
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
be checked in and tagged that's more of
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
the biology tracking for fishing game
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
department so they're required to do it
 
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
anyways but they're not required to
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
weigh the deer that's usually for the
 
01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
sportsmen they want to know what kind of
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
got okay thank you very much all right
 
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.910 align:start position:0%
got okay thank you very much all right
thank

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
you NE oh I guess representative Spain
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
is not here so he will not be next to to
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
speak um and I have uh Kathy
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.670 align:start position:0%
speak um and I have uh Kathy
labante

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
labante
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
correctly good morning I am Kathy leonti
 
01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire fishing game
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
department I serve as chief of the
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
business Division and I oversee
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
licensing for the Department New
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game opposes this bill
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to provide a few reasons as
 
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.349 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to provide a few reasons as
to

01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
why this in the end could be a
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
significant fee increase to the end user
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
that $1 fee is per license type on the
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
multiform so if
 
01:07:14.269 --> 01:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
a consumer goes into a uh brick and
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
mortar agent and they purchase a hunting
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
license they also want a muzzle loader
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
an archery and various other typ types
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
it's $1 per type if you multiply that
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
say he buys six licenses that now goes
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
up to $18 in agent fees that he's paying
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
for that agent rather than the
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
$6 in addition to that we per we um do
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
about 60% of our licenses are purchased
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
online our online vendor charges the end
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
user the credit card fee
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
so the higher the amount that the
 
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
consumer is purchasing the higher that
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
credit card fee will be so that's
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
twofold price increase for the end
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
user as I said we we have about 60% of
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
our licenses are sold online and that is
 
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
increasing at a rate every year so the
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
biggest bang I guess you could say for
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
the agent fee would be our online vendor
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
they currently earn approximately over
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
$200,000 per year in agent fees from
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
online sales this would increase their
 
01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
fees to over
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
$600,000 for selling licenses online so
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
the brick and mortar agent while we
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely need them and we respect what
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
they do this is not a big income earner
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
for them it really would uh benefit our
 
01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.789 align:start position:0%
for them it really would uh benefit our
online

01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
vendor that type of programmatic change
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
for the fishing game department would
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
cost us at an estimate between 50 and
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to implement it's programming
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
changes working with doit working with
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
our online vendor all of our
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
Publications and printing
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
cost and that as I said that estimate is
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
$100,000 one additional impact of this
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill is it has an effective date of July
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
1st our licenses are sold on a calendar
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
year basis so therefore we would not be
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
able to implement this until a January
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
1st and we would need a
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
considerable time ahead in order to
 
01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:52.759 align:start position:0%
implement it with all of the
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
changes at the end of the bill as far as
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
the increase to the registration
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
stations this is in rule it's not part
 
01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
of an RSA fishing game does not require
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
the weight of a game animal with the
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
registered thank you any questions do we
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
have any questions
representative

01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you we just heard that a
 
01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
number of the stations are weighing
 
01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
stations are uh abusing this in two ways
 
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
one of them by charging very high fees
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
for weighing and the other one for by
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
including a weighing fee in the
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
registration fee even when the person is
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
not weighing so do you do anything about
 
01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.310 align:start position:0%
not weighing so do you do anything about
this

01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
I cannot speak to that because that is
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
not something that we regulate we
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
regulate the registration stations you
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
have to register your animal which is
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
also available online you do not even
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
have to go to a brick and mortar agent
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
anymore to register a deer or a bear
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
online and I have a question so um we
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
heard that or I think guess you just
 
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
said it there's no also there's no
 
01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
requirement to weigh a deer so if
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
somebody goes to a weigh station and
 
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
they don't like the
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
price they could just say okay I'm not
 
01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
correct representative Platt yes I asked
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative Cole what the cost to the
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
vendor is is it going from one to three
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
is there any cost basis for that $3 I
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
didn't get a clear answer m do you have
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
any idea what the actual cost is and
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
should it go up from a
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
dollar well as I said we oppose the
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
legisl proposed legislation and it would
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
depend upon the
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
vendor um they do have to have a printer
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
and ink and cartridges because they sell
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
online but I am not an expert in what
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
the cost of that would
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
be yeah representa shamur thank you Mr
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
question when they come to get the deer
 
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
tagged is there a charge for that or is
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
that already included in their license
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's $5 to register a deer a deer but
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
when they follow
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
up when they come to the station to have
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
a tagged after they've killed it m there
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
is there a fee or no fee or no there is
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
you yes represent
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question but there would be a
 
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
fee for the turkey right because they do
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
have to weigh the turkey or could they
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
weigh it at home they do have to weigh
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
weigh a turkey that is the only game
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%

1514 relative to excess funds paid to
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities for the use of school
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
districts this bill requires
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities to remit any excess
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%

questions for Dr well I think I think it
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:30.270 align:start position:0%
 
up

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the

committee my name is Keen main Wong tax
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
Dr again uh this is Bruce can supervisor
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue um I just uh want to make a
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
point of clarification um in if you have
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
noticed that in the um in the fiscal
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
note provided at the back of the bill
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
the uh LBA noted that this uh proposed
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
legislation would have no uh Revenue
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
increase to the state uh but has a uh
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
State reduction in state expenditure by
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
the $29 million of the excess swept uh
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
in when we the Dr Was preparing the
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note our take on that was uh
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
actually uh we noted that potentially
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
could be a an increase in state revenue
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
and the reason why we stated that it was
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
an increase in state revenue was because
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
the 363 million has already been
 
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
initially been uh recognized as a state
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
income um state revenue uh when the uh
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
swep bill is issued for the 363 million
 
01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
and then with the uh excess swep being
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
without the excess swep being remitted
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
back to the state now with this bill
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
having the excess swep being remitted to
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
the state uh our thinking is that
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
potentially that $ 29 or $26
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
million um would then be an additional
 
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
cash flow um that is in the into the
 
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
education trust fund um whether that is
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
um in you know that's the reasoning for
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
for our um explanation that's the
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
explanation for our um our fiscal note
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
comment however um whether that is the
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
actual accounting process I am not too
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
sure and that probably potentially could
 
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
be something that be CL clarified with
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
the LBA
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
okay questions representative
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
llee thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.030 align:start position:0%
llee thank you thank you for taking my
question

01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
um can you walk me through um the
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
current practice so I'm thank you for
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
including the list of uh
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the financial note I'm
 
01:17:51.629 --> 01:17:51.639 align:start position:0%
looking for example at Waterville Valley
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
um 504
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
4,231 so this
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
is money
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
currently doesn't actually come to the
 
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
state can you walk me through how it
 
01:18:08.239 --> 01:18:09.590 align:start position:0%
state can you walk me through how it
currently

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
Works um so I will try um that that
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
table at the back that's actually
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
provided by the LBA um I'm not sure um
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
the source for that information but LBA
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
probably can provide that
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
essentially um so this table I believe
 
01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
is showing the amount the municipalities
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
that has um soal access swept um that
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
is in addition to uh what they
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
please um for very specific questions
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
representative I would probably defer to
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
someone from education
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
but because we work so closely with them
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
I think I can handle the general
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
framework um under current conditions
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue is going to go
 
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
first in this process as I described in
 
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
that earlier Bill and we're going to
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
create uh the amounts that ultimately
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
would be the swept warrants to a
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
municipality let's just leave it at that
 
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.070 align:start position:0%
municipality let's just leave it at that
a

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
municipality we're going to give those
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
amounts to the Department of Education
 
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
because they need them in order to help
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
them with the calculation of adequacy
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
Aid and during that
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
calculation they will be able to see
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
whether the amount of the dollar amount
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
of swept that will be raised for a in a
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
municipality is greater or less than the
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
calculated adequacy a amount of which
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
the details I know only enough to be
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous definitely ask education about
 
01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
how that happens but it's right there
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's probably what's
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
behind the LBA estimates is that
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
difference so if the swept amount that
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
we calculated for a
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
municipality let's just say it's a
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars if the total adequacy
 
01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
Aid is greater than
 
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
Aid is greater than
that

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
then the swept will be raised on that
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
tax and and turned over to that school
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
district and the adequacy aid will flow
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
to the school district pursuant to the
 
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.629 align:start position:0%
to the school district pursuant to the
other

01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:31.639 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
laws I believe it's when the two numbers
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
are um in a different order that that
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
the swept is greater dollar amount is
 
01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
greater than the derived adequacy Aid
 
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
total you end up that difference is the
 
01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:51.709 align:start position:0%
total you end up that difference is the
quote

01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:56.669 align:start position:0%
 
excess

01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.679 --> 01:20:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
may I'm here for 10 minutes less than 10
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
minutes you just arrived back thank you
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
but you can it off
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um so I have a
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
followup I followed you thank you for
 
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
your slow and careful explanation so
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
that I could understand so if the total
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy is less
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
excess um to the tune of let's say
 
01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.070 align:start position:0%
excess um to the tune of let's say
million

01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
dollars um what does that mean what
 
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
happens um uh so I live in Manchester so
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
we receive money from the state in the
 
01:21:43.229 --> 01:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
form of adequacy right so um help me
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
understand the if if your town generates
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
more money than you need what happens
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
under current law the swept amount
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
uh will be raised through the local tax
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
billing process through your swept rate
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
that dollar amount will be turned over
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
to the local school
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
district now the the
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
accounting uh Keen understands better
 
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
the state accounting I don't think about
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
it that way um it's not part of our work
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
in calculating the rates but the actual
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
tax is raised locally it's collected
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
locally and is then in it so many words
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
it's forwarded to the school district so
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
it isn't an excess amount under the
 
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
current framework it's it's you can see
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
the number that's why you have that
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
list but it's not well this bill would
 
01:22:45.149 --> 01:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
change that in effect right right so may
 
01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair may I have a followup sure
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um so let's say this number
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
were a million dollars so um in a
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
municipality where there's excess of a
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars they forward it to the
 
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.270 align:start position:0%
million dollars they forward it to the
school

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
district their their own school district
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
and so their school district just spends
 
01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
an extra1 million or $5 million or is
 
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
that return to the property taxpayers in
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
that town it doesn't come to the state
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
of New
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it stays with the town because
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's just a number that's written down
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's not money that actually flows to
 
01:23:24.310 --> 01:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
the state and then get sent back to the
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
town yeah from the perspective of
 
01:23:27.679 --> 01:23:29.990 align:start position:0%
town yeah from the perspective of
the

01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
municipality and the taxpayers of that
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
municipality those are real tax dollars
 
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
being collected and then forwarded to
 
01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
the school district okay in terms of the
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
relationship between
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
the swept
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
amount and the local
 
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
school taxes to be raised and hence the
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
local school rate they pursuant to
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
statute we before we set the local
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
school rate have to account for the fact
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
that that swept
 
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
amount is going to that district and it
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
functions as if it was an additional
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
non-property tax revenue so the swept
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
amount um is real cash moving to the
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
school district in that one perspective
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
but from the tax rate perspective the
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
swept tax
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
dollars are functioning to add to the
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
other local school district revenues
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
thus reducing the amount of local school
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
needed I know I don't I don't think I
 
01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:42.990 align:start position:0%
needed I know I don't I don't think I
get

01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
it well so this let me can I ask one
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
more question follow up yeah sorry I'm
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
going to ask the question different L um
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
so I know how so I see Waterville Valley
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
and I just pick on them because I happen
 
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
to know a number probably not from last
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
year of what they spent per pupil and I
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
know what Manchester spends per pupil so
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
in Manchester let's say we spend
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
$113,000 per pupil I know in Waterville
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
Valley it's $36,000 per pupil so I'm
 
01:25:19.709 --> 01:25:19.719 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if that let's call
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
it 20 some thousand difference yeah
 
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
is that where that money is coming from
 
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
or is it more complicated than
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to the choice of of
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh appropriating monies and spending I I
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to that but I think I have
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
a framework that might help um the hole
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
even right now most school districts
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
most municipalities are ending their
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
budget preparation process bringing
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
budgets getting ready to take them out
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
voters when you think of it that way the
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
budget any budget really has two pieces
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations what do you want to
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
spend and the estimate of offsetting
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
revenues net those two and you have a
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
first estimate as to the taxes or other
 
01:26:12.109 --> 01:26:12.119 align:start position:0%
funding sources necessary to pay for the
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations think of it that way
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
swept is a funding source up against the
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
local school district it's going to
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
function that way adequacy Aid is a
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
funding source supporting the
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
appropriations of the
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
district and what's happening is because
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
swept is a separate tax but being turned
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
over to the school
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
district it's reducing the local school
 
01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.149 align:start position:0%
district it's reducing the local school
district

01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
taxes if you think of that just
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
Appropriations minus non-property tax
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
revenues gives you the initial taxes now
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
reduce that by the adequacy aid dollars
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
coming in and reduce it by the swept
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
dollars coming
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
in and now we have the taxes that need
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
to be raised on the local school
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
district tax rate that's the that's the
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
relationship between the two in real
 
01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
terms the swept taxes being collected
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
and is being turned over to the school
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
district as are the local school
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
district tax dollars they look a little
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
fungible but you can think of them
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
separately but they are moving from
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers through the municipality to
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
the school district thank you very much
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you any other
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%

to represent shamber as comes
across

01:28:58.750 --> 01:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
he answered most of our
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%

Beckford from new dorham I also

represent
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
Middleton this bill uh should
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
be uh considered a response to this
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision of uh Steven Rand
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
versus the state of New Hampshire which
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
ruled that the
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
swept uh way it's administrated
 
01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax is uh
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to to do it in the
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
fashion we're doing it so we need to
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
change the law otherwise the court has
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
the right and ability to make the
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
decision for us and uh we changed the
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
swept in 200 uh
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
11 and if you
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
look under the paper I passed out to you
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
um two at 258
 
01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
co7 now this was in 2011 it was HB 337
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
it changes the statute to allow excess
 
01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax known
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
as swept funds funds over and above what
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
the district was
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
allowed uh from swept
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be left with the towns to use as they
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
wished and that was done by striking out
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the middle on the n on
 
01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:31.639 align:start position:0%
Roman two they Str it was stricken out
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
in 2011 right there that's all it took
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
to uh now the excess funds to be used by
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
the towns wherever um but it was
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to be and originally was
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
intended to go to all of it to school
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
district it's it's really the same as a
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
Roman meals tax the state collects it
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
but in this case case they leave some of
 
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
it with the town say you can keep all of
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
you can keep a portion of this much x
 
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars but you don't need uh
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
say like a very rich town that has lake
 
01:31:03.679 --> 01:31:04.590 align:start position:0%
say like a very rich town that has lake
front

01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
front
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
property um they're not going to leave
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
it with the town because like Roman's
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
tax they owe it to the state it's not a
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
town tax it's a state
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
tax and so um it used to be collected by
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
Dr and then it' be uh distributed to the
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
other towns in an equitable fashion so
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
everybody got a fair amount and so what
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting with this bill is just go
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
back to the old system I believe it was
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
Fred Bonte and uh Senator sapareto that
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
brought it Forward back when we were
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
doing the you uh well it was 90 97 I
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
think that we had the clamont decisions
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
we had to make changes and we came up
 
01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
with the Statewide property taxes one of
 
01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
those things we could use and and not
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
Institute a um income tax so again I'm
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
suggesting we go back
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
to where we changed it because it's
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the way it
 
01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:06.189 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the way it
is

01:32:06.189 --> 01:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah the the the decision also says
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
it states that such funds must be used
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
for the exclusive purpose of satisfying
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
the state's adequacy Aid
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
obligations and uh now
 
01:32:24.030 --> 01:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what this bill does now
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's a little extra wording in it
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
than what there was before and the
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
fellow that did the bill says well
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's been some changes over at Dr I
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
think and but this takes us back there
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
to to where we used to be before it was
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um I should let me look
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
here um just for it
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh information there's another bill over
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
in education that's very similar to this
 
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
so I recommend you folks take a look at
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't understand why there's two
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
different Bills going to two different
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh committees doing pretty much the same
 
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
thing the only one I could see the only
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
thing I could see in that bill was they
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
said and you really really cannot do
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
this and send the money back to towns
 
01:33:20.669 --> 01:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
you know for towns to use it for them
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
okay that
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
I think that's pretty much all I have
 
01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.590 align:start position:0%
I think that's pretty much all I have
for

01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
you hope that's very
 
01:33:30.669 --> 01:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
convincing thank you um you have a
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
question do you have a question yeah
 
01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:34.669 align:start position:0%
question do you have a question yeah
representative

01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
alme thank you
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
um how can you send education money back
 
01:33:43.149 --> 01:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
to the general fund inste how can you
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
send money back to the educ the general
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
fund that came from the education trust
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.669 align:start position:0%
fund that came from the education trust
fund

01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
well I'm the wrong guy to ask that I I I
 
01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
asked Ben the same thing the fellow that
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
did this his name is Ben and I called
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
him up a couple times I said why is it
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
being done this way why not the
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
simplistic way we had in 11 and he said
 
01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
it was because of the changes other
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
changes in the law eventually it gets
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
over to the trust fund is is and he said
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
if you wanted he'd be happy to come here
 
01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:13.350 align:start position:0%
if you wanted he'd be happy to come here
and

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
explain is is follow Ben in the drafting
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes okay he's the one that drafted the
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you so we had a few
 
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
conversations with the same thing I wish
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
I could I told myself I'm never going to
 
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
be able to repeat this well so he said
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
he would come here and talk to you if
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
you wanted the other option uh
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
representative may be to get him to put
 
01:34:33.870 --> 01:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
a statement together and you could
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
submit it to the
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee could be
 
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
lengthy but yeah if we don't understand
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
it it's going to be harder
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
to Yes uh representative fellows um yes
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
I have a question about the fact that
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
your bill says the municipal
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
takes the money that it collects from
 
01:34:59.709 --> 01:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
swep and sends it back to the state
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
so okay in in my town and as far as I
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
know in every town not everybody pays
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
their tax bill um sometimes they don't
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
pay it at all sometimes they don't pay
 
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
it on time Y how how are so the money
 
01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
in how is that going to work that sounds
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
pretty complicated sometimes they pay it
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
late well the way the system is set up
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
the towns are responsible for collecting
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
the money and if they don't collect the
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
money as you pointed out they take out a
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
tax anticipation note they have to
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
borrow the money then they're given the
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
authority to confiscate property after I
 
01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
think two years and a day to be able to
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
cover their uh cost of does does that
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
answer your question so I I think so so
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
so that means that every town is going
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
to have to probably well they they might
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
not have to borrow it they might have
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
funds available but they're going to
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
have to send money to the state that
 
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
collect yeah and and it probably means
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
that would you think that for the past
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
20 years they've been sending all of
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the total swept amount is to
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
the school districts but of course there
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
have been cases when people don't pay
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
their taxes and so the towns never
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
really collect all that
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
amount only since 2011 when the law was
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
changed it was I think it was an
 
01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:37.159 align:start position:0%
amendment maybe a floor Amendment it was
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
repr of Hess as I recall that uh
 
01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.109 align:start position:0%
repr of Hess as I recall that uh
submitted

01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
01:36:41.119 --> 01:36:42.709 align:start position:0%
submitted
it

01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
um and then we went to uh letting towns
 
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.470 align:start position:0%
um and then we went to uh letting towns
use

01:36:47.470 --> 01:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
the um anything over and above what they
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
would need in other words they they get
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
their portion that's enough to fund the
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
school at the rate that was
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
determined but because they have so much
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
profit in town There's an additional
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
amount well that money is supposed to go
 
01:37:05.629 --> 01:37:05.639 align:start position:0%
back to I'm going to say Dr and they're
 
01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
going to redistribute it I think it's a
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
complicated way to do it if I had my way
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'd have the state collect all the money
 
01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
into one pool like we do with room and
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
meals tax and then they redistribute it
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
gasoline tax these are all state taxes
 
01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
but it confuses people when goes to the
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
town like that and you're right Town's
 
01:37:27.189 --> 01:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
the ones that's got to cover the uh what
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't come in and we used to be able
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
to in my town New Durham cover the whole
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
thing you know with uh money in the
 
01:37:38.669 --> 01:37:38.679 align:start position:0%
general fund but now we've been uh
 
01:37:41.950 --> 01:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
borrowing to to cover you know we have
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little expensive right now too so
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
that goes against the
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
taxpayers okay representative ORS and
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
followed by repres in elberger thank you
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
question so prior to
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
2011 would you and I realize you're
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
talking for Ben a little bit here would
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
you and Ben agree that the swep system
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
worked and it was the change in 2011
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
that allowed towns to as you just said
 
01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
withhold paying into swept some towns
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
and and therefore it's kind of messed up
 
01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
the system messed it up so it's
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional now but did follow up
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
follow up so but prior to 2011 did the
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
swept system work as yes the answer yes
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
it did it it works so well I think we
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
should go to it and and abolish the
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
local tax I think we should have the
 
01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
schools be paid for by the state um
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's what the Supreme Court has told
 
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.589 align:start position:0%
that's what the Supreme Court has told
us

01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
clamont both clamont decisions are that
 
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
way uh what's the word and they cherish
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
the word cherish was interpreted to mean
 
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
the word cherish was interpreted to mean
fun

01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
fun
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's a way to do it we
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to a sales tax and an
 
01:38:58.510 --> 01:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
income tax well we're stuck with a
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
property tax so everybody gets
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
um uh taxed equitably throughout the
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
state that was the gway
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
decision and uh and then distributed to
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
the schools as uh the Department of
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
Education probably is the one that would
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
make the
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
decision representative
 
01:39:20.669 --> 01:39:20.679 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman your
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
comment just now leaves me trying to
 
01:39:25.950 --> 01:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
figure out what my question is so let me
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
try this the swep tax at this point is
 
01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
basically a local property tax that this
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry functionally okay functionally
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking legally but functionally
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's a local property tax that the state
 
01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:45.159 align:start position:0%
claims as being its
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
contribution to local education is that
 
01:39:52.270 --> 01:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
a reasonable descript destion it's
 
01:39:54.109 --> 01:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
applied to every locality but it's a
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
state tax it's it's just like we have
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
our County tax okay oh I'm sorry thank
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
you it's can't see
 
01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
you it's it's not a local tax the sweat
 
01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
what we pay on our tax bills it's just
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
like having a county bill that's a
 
01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
county tax had nothing to do with the
 
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
town the only thing the town has to do
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
with is collecting the money your tax
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
collector takes the money and then it
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
gets distributed just like anything else
 
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
um your county tax a St going have to
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
cut a tech for at a certain time I think
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
it's December really tight if you ever
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
get a chance to change things it makes
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
it very tight for the towns to get that
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
check out to them because they're still
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
collecting money in but you see it's a
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
state tax just like R and meals so
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
therefore there's no right to have the
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
excess money from it belongs to the
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
schools followup Mr chair followup thank
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
you it's
 
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
officially a state tax yes
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
it's based on local property values so
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
when I pay my tax bill and it says my
 
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal tax my my property tax list
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
Municipal tax and County tax and swept
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
tax MH it's all coming out of my
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
property bill it's not a tax the same
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
way that business taxes go into the
 
01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
general fund and then get spent from
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
there right the state business yeah they
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
don't they don't pull it the same way
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
right the collection is the same but the
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
pulling the pooling and distribution is
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
different so my yes thank you my
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
question is as someone else
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
asked if there is excess why would the
 
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
excess go into the general fund rather
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
than back to property
 
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who have been
 
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
um be there there's a uh decision on how
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
much money each Town needs now someone
 
01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.669 align:start position:0%
much money each Town needs now someone
like

01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
clamont um doesn't have much
 
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
money over there someone like in
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
wolfboro say with a right beside the the
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
lake there has a lot of property from
 
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
people that come from wherever other
 
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
countries even and put up palaces on the
 
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
edge of the lake well because it's a
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
state tax that money belongs to the
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
state not to the town
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
none of it belongs to the town that the
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.790 --> 01:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
collection no repr thank you
 
01:42:32.390 --> 01:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative house and came back now
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's officially in that status and uh it
 
01:42:39.550 --> 01:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
provides it it approaches this problem
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
in a different way it is entirely an
 
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
agreement with your position that this
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
is a state
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
tax um and it provides
 
01:42:56.310 --> 01:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
for the remittance by the M municipality
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
that still collects the money entirely
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:43:04.510 --> 01:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
state to the education trust fund to the
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
Dr and then into the education trust
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
fund um and fee this bill also allows 3%
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
for the mun municipalities to keep as a
 
01:43:18.990 --> 01:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
processing fee and then then they send
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
the balance so I that's a bill in this
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
Committee in U education there's a broad
 
01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
school funding bill that has within it
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
swept reform that has the same
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions so my question to you that's
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
background is whether you would
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
consider um I'm not asking you Pro or
 
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
con right now but this is an alternative
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
that seeks to resolve the Constitutional
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
issue but in a different way and it
 
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
avoids the uh difficulties that may
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
arise in the timing of the determination
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
of just what is excess swept and so
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
forth it just all goes into the general
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
fund into the education trust fund um so
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering how you would react to
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
that proposal as in contrast to
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
yours uh that might be fine I'd have to
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
look a little more closely but it's
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
certainly in the right direction and uh
 
01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:21.629 align:start position:0%
certainly in the right direction and uh
my

01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:44:25.149 --> 01:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
I I put this bill in because I had a
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good feeling that this Rand
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
decision was going to come out in as
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
being unconstitutional what we changed
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
in 11 it wasn't unconstitutional before
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
that it became unconstitutional there
 
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying all we got to do is uh go
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
back to what we did and we'll be
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional and we don't have to
 
01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:43.719 align:start position:0%
worry about the court coming in and
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
taking over for us um they don't want to
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
do it and we've done it and I felt we
 
01:44:51.390 --> 01:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
were fairly successful in the past
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know some of my editorials have been
 
01:44:56.589 --> 01:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
I would go beyond like this gentleman I
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
spoke to about so this is just go back
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
beginning but uh thank you um this is a
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
u well this whole thing is a very
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
complex issue in general and we know
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
through court cases and uh constant
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
striving to come to a good decision here
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
um we'll take this up in a work session
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
um does anyone else have a final
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
question yes representative
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
fellows yes so on the fiscal note Dr
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
says that this amount that that could
 
01:45:34.719 --> 01:45:35.669 align:start position:0%
says that this amount that that could
could

01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
be the high the high end that could be
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
going back to the to the state is 29
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
million um frankly I think it I think
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
less than 29 million would be collected
 
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
but no do you I don't think anybody pays
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
all their taxes on time so they wouldn't
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
get the whole amount about but but my
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
point being 29 million is compared to
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
the $3 billion do that is being spent on
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
on public education that is
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
1% do you think this is really going to
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
make a big
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
impact yes I think it'll make an impact
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we did it
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
you know we we needed another source of
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
income uh back I don't know who who can
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
remember uh
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh Susan Aly she she would remember when
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
we had I don't know what you're talking
 
01:46:35.910 --> 01:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
about oh you don't
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
no I'm talking about when we we first
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
did this you've been here since
 
01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:45.639 align:start position:0%
forever I I hope do it and we we
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
instituted this back when Fred banti was
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
planning running for governor he he
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
didn't make it but this is platform of
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
his and you remember Frank
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
sapareto and they pushed very much and
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
said well okay we're not going to do
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
this property tax I mean excuse me
 
01:47:02.669 --> 01:47:02.679 align:start position:0%
income tax not going to do sales tax you
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
know we had Governor Shaheen that wanted
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
a sales tax but she didn't want an
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
income tax um so anyway the the
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
compromise was to okay we're already
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
using property tax anyway so if we do it
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
from the state that'll satisfy the con
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
the Claymont decision that says it the
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
word cherishing it which means we have
 
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.470 align:start position:0%
word cherishing it which means we have
to

01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:27.229 align:start position:0%
to
fund

01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
so um you got to do
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
something this is a this is a simple and
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
easy way out because that's what we did
 
01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:37.719 align:start position:0%
before any other
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
much representative thank you thank you
 
01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:45.550 align:start position:0%
much representative thank you thank you
very

01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
much I don't have any other pink cards
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:50.950 align:start position:0%
on uh
HB

01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
1514 is there anyone else that' like to
 
01:47:54.589 --> 01:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
testify on
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
this oh question well it's just a
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
comment to to the committee uh both uh
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury and I
 
01:48:10.990 --> 01:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
I are um on a special subcommittee of
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
the education committee and looking
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
at school funding bills they include
 
01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:19.229 align:start position:0%
at school funding bills they include
house

01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:21.990 align:start position:0%
house
bill

01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
1856 I believe it is I got that
 
01:48:32.109 --> 01:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
1486 no not 14 directly addresses swept
 
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:35.080 align:start position:0%
in a different way yes in 1586
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lun no bill very
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
confusing because 1486
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
1586 incorporates much of uh
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ames bill that's
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
currently an interim study so we have
 
01:48:48.589 --> 01:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
four bills oh wait a minute there's a
 
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
third Bill uh which is the next number
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
up um 1686 yeah which is sponsored by
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed when I said 14 I
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
meant 16 you're co-sponsoring on that
 
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
one yes I'm a co-sponsor that
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill um takes excess swept like this
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
bill and moves it to the state but I
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
just I I I ra raise this just because I
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
think everybody should be aware of we
 
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
got several different ways of
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
approaching this and right now in two
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
different policy committees which is
 
01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
most unfortunate and then we've got in
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
our committee this interim study bill
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
which is my Prime sponsored bill um
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
somehow we're going to have to pull all
 
01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
this stuff together but uh yes I just
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
this background music for everybody
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ames and I I
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
think uh yeah this is and this is why my
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
previous comment that there's there's a
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
lot going on here and and we're going to
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
need to uh take this into advisement and
 
01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
and uh into a work session can just add
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ames just said
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what I was going to say I just
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that when the special
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on education funding meets
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
on FR on Friday for a work session we'll
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that they know about the two
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
bills that are ways and means great
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
sounds good thank you very
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
much all right I'm going to close the
 
01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%

01:51:29.709 --> 01:51:29.719 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open the uh public
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
1484 um let me first say before
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
introducing the uh before we introduce
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
the bill um I have a lot of pink cards
 
01:51:43.069 --> 01:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
here I see a lot of you are passionate
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
on this one way or the other and if
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
there's uh me if there are people here
 
01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
who know each other and feel comfortable
 
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
coming up to the the desk at the same
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
time and talking consolidating uh
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that would be helpful um so
 
01:51:59.069 --> 01:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
that we can um get all the information
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
but not um Extended unnecessarily all
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
right first we'll invite up uh
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
bill thank you chairman and thank you to
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
the committee for allowing me to speak
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
today I am representative aan Kelly
 
01:52:27.310 --> 01:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
representing Berlin Carol Jefferson and
 
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
Whitefield many of you may have heard uh
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
recently about a situation in Northern
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
Coos I want to start by saying that this
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
bill is not meant to deal directly with
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
that issue um that situation highlighted
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
something that with this bill I'm
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
attempting to address I apologize in
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
advance for the length but this topic
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
has taken me six months to digest and I
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
still feel I'm only seeing the top of
 
01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:48.830 align:start position:0%
still feel I'm only seeing the top of
the

01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
iceberg I assume many of you can
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
sympathize with now having to boil that
 
01:52:54.750 --> 01:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
down into a 15-minute speech you can
 
01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:55.950 align:start position:0%
down into a 15-minute speech you can
digest

01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
digest
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
today first we need to grasp the idea of
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
an emissions reduction ton in ER often
 
01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
referred to colloquially as carbon
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
credits and er represents the equivalent
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
of removing one metric ton of carbon
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
dioxide from our atmosphere it's a
 
01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:11.800 align:start position:0%
standard unit adopted by financial
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
markets much like we talk about oil
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
production and trade in terms of barrels
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
when it's often when it often never
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
actually ends up in a barrel anymore
 
01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
what an ER looks like in real life can
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
vary it helps to break the system into
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
two categories the regulated compliance
 
01:53:28.189 --> 01:53:28.199 align:start position:0%
market and the voluntary Market
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
compliance markets are systems imposed
 
01:53:31.709 --> 01:53:31.719 align:start position:0%
by governments these are often referred
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
to as cap and trade programs every
 
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
business in a state or a country is
 
01:53:37.470 --> 01:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
given a yearly cap on their emissions if
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
they're above that cap they can lower
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
their own emissions or pay other
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
businesses to offset their emissions in
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
the latter case they would purchase
 
01:53:48.270 --> 01:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
erts each year the cap is lowered and so
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
demand for erts Rises and with so so
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
does the
 
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
value California has the only regulated
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
market here in the US but there are many
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
other markets around the world incl
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
including Europe and South Korea it's
 
01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
important to note that none of these
 
01:54:05.109 --> 01:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
markets are uh are limited to their own
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
geographic region the voluntary Market
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
is much more complex and harder to grasp
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
due to the rising import importance of
 
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
ESG metrics investors have placed
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
increasing Demand on large corporations
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
to prove their ability to recognize how
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
their own emissions are affecting our
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
climate for many large companies like
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
Delta or Exxon Mobile this has meant
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
voluntarily funding projects that
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
purport to fight climate change they do
 
01:54:30.669 --> 01:54:30.679 align:start position:0%
this through the purchase of erts this
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
has led to a whole new industry of
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
carbon Traders working in dozens of
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
different exchanges with hundreds of
 
01:54:37.149 --> 01:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
project developers marketers private
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
regulators and certification authorities
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
I don't have the time today to describe
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
the complexity of this network I would
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
point you to an article in Bloomberg
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
last month titled Wall Street gets ready
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
to cash in on1 trillion climate Market
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
the article describes how the world's
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
largest banks Goldman Sachs City Group
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
JP Morgan and Barclays have all
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
established dedicated carbon trading
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
desks in the last three years in
 
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
response to the rapid growth in this
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
voluntary carbon
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
market so how do we get from carbon
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
credits to current use while erts come
 
01:55:10.109 --> 01:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
in dozens of forms from landfill gas
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
Reclamation to solar Farms 80% of all
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
credit sold on the California Market as
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
an example are classified as Forest
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
carbon credits these Forest credits fall
 
01:55:22.109 --> 01:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
into three types aforestation credits
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
where you are protecting land that is
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
under threat of complete deforestation
 
01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
reforestation credits where you are
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
planting a new Forest on deforested land
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
and improved Forest management or ifm
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
credits where current forestry practices
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
are altered to improve carbon retention
 
01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:42.679 align:start position:0%
these ifm credits represent 84% of all
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
carbon credits sold on the California
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
Market the reason they are so ubiquitous
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
is that they are comparatively cheap to
 
01:55:51.310 --> 01:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
produce lack the regulatory burden of
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
other projects and they rely on
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
measurements already done in industrial
 
01:55:54.639 --> 01:55:55.790 align:start position:0%
measurements already done in industrial
forestry

01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
forestry
 
01:55:58.270 --> 01:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
operations as domestic industrial Timber
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
production has waned over the last three
 
01:56:01.709 --> 01:56:01.719 align:start position:0%
decades we have seen institutional
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
investors like hedge funds and private
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
Equity become the owners of large tracks
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
of land all over the US in a 2001 study
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
bemoaning this development the New
 
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based Forest Society stated
 
01:56:15.550 --> 01:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
the longterm implications of this shift
 
01:56:18.069 --> 01:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
are not yet understood while many of
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
these institutional investors have
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
largely continued traditional forestry
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
practices I believe the Boom in Forest
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
carbon credits shows us exactly what the
 
01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
long-term implications will
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
be that 2001 study shows us how domestic
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
Timber production in New Hampshire is
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
specifically threatened by a booming
 
01:56:38.069 --> 01:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
Forest carbon Market industrial
 
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
Timberland accounted for only 10% of New
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire land but accounted for the
 
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
majority majority of harvested logs a
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
2021 study from the New Hampshire Farm
 
01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:49.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau found that 82% of people who
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
gener generated revenue from current
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
used Forest land owned more than 100
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
acres these owners represent only 8% of
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
land owners in New Hampshire but they
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
own over 95% of the remaining Forest
 
01:57:04.229 --> 01:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
land if only a few of these large land
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
owners chose to switch from traditional
 
01:57:08.430 --> 01:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
forestry to carbon credit production it
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
would mean the end of Timber production
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
in this state just this year the
 
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
decision of a single large landowner to
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
do just that was a key factor in a
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
month-long shutdown at New Hampshire's
 
01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
largest sawmill we cannot afford to not
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
act on this issue otherwise those jobs
 
01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
in an entire way of life will be lost
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
forever there are many issues like
 
01:57:30.270 --> 01:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
carbon credits that the state many
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
issues with carbon credits that the
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
state needs to resolve I have a separate
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
bill before another committee to replace
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
the timber tax that would be lost from
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
adoption of Timber of carbon credit
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
programs as I testified and as we heard
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
last week from many of the people who
 
01:57:45.790 --> 01:57:45.800 align:start position:0%
will testify against this bill today
 
01:57:48.189 --> 01:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
that is going to be a very complex
 
01:57:51.149 --> 01:57:51.159 align:start position:0%
process we agree on that point there is
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
no single metric that we can just point
 
01:57:56.109 --> 01:57:56.119 align:start position:0%
to and say you owe the town 10% of that
 
01:57:58.109 --> 01:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
there is currently no state or federal
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism for tracking all Forest carbon
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
contracts those contracts can vary in
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
length from one year to hundreds of
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
years the value of a credit will vary
 
01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
wildly based on hundreds of factors
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
including the market in which it's sold
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
none of which are based here in New
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire any ask any person testifying
 
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
today what a single ER is worth and
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
you'll be hard pressed to get a straight
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
answer we don't even have an estimate
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
for how many credits were generated on
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Forest land last year not
 
01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
even an estimate the first timber tax
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
took land lawmakers six years to pass
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
and it even passed only by a single vote
 
01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
I expect a new Timber tax will take us
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
years to properly
 
01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
craft this bill you have today is my
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
simple solution it is meant as a
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
placeholder until we have a new
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place that makes towns
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
whole all it simply does is says that
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
land generating er no longer qualifies
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
as Forest land under current use this is
 
01:58:56.109 --> 01:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
completely fair and I think by reading
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
of RSA 79a that should already be the
 
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
case the RSA defines Forest land as land
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
growing as determined as land growing
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
trees as determined and classified by
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
criteria developed by the state Forester
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
and adopted by the board the intention
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
of that definition is further explained
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
by the definition of unproductive land
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
which says it is land incapable of
 
01:59:21.709 --> 01:59:21.719 align:start position:0%
producing agriculture or Forest Products
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
or where the location of which renders
 
01:59:26.109 --> 01:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
it inaccessible or impractical for the
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
harvesting of Agriculture or Forest
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
Products Forest land was never meant to
 
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:33.320 align:start position:0%
exist under current use without the
 
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
harvesting of trees that is even more
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
clear when you see the methods for the
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
conservation easements were established
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
by the same piece of legislation in
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
1973 the current use board sets the
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
rates for White Pine and hardwood forest
 
01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
Land Based on the idea that a 10% Timber
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
tax will be paid to town in lie of the
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
yearly property taxes they lose through
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
current use land that is not paying that
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
tax should not qualify for a subsidy
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
from other local
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers what I'm asking and what what
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
I wish was laid out better in this bill
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
is that we the legislature should make
 
02:00:07.229 --> 02:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
clear the to the current use board that
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
this activity is wholly separate from
 
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
traditional Forest practices we should
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
give them the opportunity to hold public
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
hearings with those parties interested
 
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:17.800 align:start position:0%
in in selling carbon credits and set a
 
02:00:19.950 --> 02:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
new rate based on the loss of Timber
 
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
taxes we have many other questions to
 
02:00:23.870 --> 02:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
answer about carbon credits and while we
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
do while we cannot allow while we do we
 
02:00:28.109 --> 02:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
cannot allow our forest land to be
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
locked up for hundreds of years by
 
02:00:31.629 --> 02:00:31.639 align:start position:0%
speculators and others on Wall Street
 
02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:33.159 align:start position:0%
looking to make a quick return for
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
investors we cannot afford to wait for
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
another year you will likely hear from
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
many today who are opposed to this
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
solution I would ask you to please ask
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
them to elaborate on why I agree that
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
current use has worked well in this
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
state but we're talking about a paradigm
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
shifting event event that risks changing
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
the very premise the program is based on
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
the trees will continue to grow as the
 
02:00:57.069 --> 02:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
current used board does their works and
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
once we have the proper guard rails in
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
place they will be able to sell the
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
exact same number of credits they would
 
02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
have otherwise thank you again for the
 
02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
time I apologize uh for the length and
 
02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh representative PL
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
do believe I wrote down every word
 
02:01:17.709 --> 02:01:17.719 align:start position:0%
verbatim I don't think you would do you
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
have that testimony the final testimony
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
to the through the portal to and I'll
 
02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
email it directly to you all thank you
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
representative shamber thank you Mr
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative taking
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
this question uh so what will be the
 
02:01:34.790 --> 02:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
effect on the amount of dollars that can
 
02:01:37.470 --> 02:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
be put into a a conservation funds of
 
02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:38.430 align:start position:0%
be put into a a conservation funds of
these

02:01:38.430 --> 02:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
towns uh when the land use or the
 
02:01:42.990 --> 02:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
current use
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
changes yeah and I understand the bill
 
02:01:47.629 --> 02:01:47.639 align:start position:0%
itself as it was written and it was a a
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
tough time to get this LSR through um I
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
I believe should have said it will also
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
create a new category under current use
 
02:01:56.910 --> 02:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
for this generated property so that that
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
way they they aren't losing out they
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
aren't being forced to change in
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
fact it could exist under the forest
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
land designation alongside hardwood and
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
white pine and other a specific fee for
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
carbon credit generation which wouldn't
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
use

02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you I wasn't quite following that
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
one because I was thinking about my own
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
question but which is perhaps
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
related but uh if we imposed this and
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
all um Forest land in uh current use
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
which is being used for tax credits at
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
this point um became uh fully taxable
 
02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
under our property
 
02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
taxes wouldn't we end up with a lot less
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
Forest before you finished passing your
 
02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:02.470 align:start position:0%
Forest before you finished passing your
other

02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill yeah so I again I would recommend
 
02:03:07.149 --> 02:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
that this be that there be an amendment
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
put in place to specifically give
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
current the current use board the
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
ability to reclassify or to create a new
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
designation for carbon credits I think
 
02:03:17.709 --> 02:03:17.719 align:start position:0%
that that's vital to to to exactly what
 
02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um I think that the
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
the the I we have no idea exactly how
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
many acres in the state are under carbon
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
credits there's no way to measure that
 
02:03:29.310 --> 02:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
there's no because there's all these
 
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary markets there's no single
 
02:03:34.109 --> 02:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
place that we can go to and say you know
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
where are the credits being generated in
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at the same time we can go
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
to the Bureau of uh forest and lands and
 
02:03:42.669 --> 02:03:42.679 align:start position:0%
ask them specifically how many logs were
 
02:03:44.069 --> 02:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
taken from New Hampshire Forest last
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
year we have all those statistics
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
because we require them by law we don't
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
require that for carbon credits at this
 
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
time so we have no way to develop a
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
framework we have no way to even begin
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
the discussion about what they should be
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
what they should be paying towns because
 
02:03:58.589 --> 02:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have those numbers so my my my
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
intention you know first of all I would
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
have I would be hardpressed to ask towns
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
to find out who's generating carbon
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
credits in their in their area like we
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
don't know as a state the local towns
 
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
with the especially in the in the small
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
areas where current use is much more
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
prevalent it's going to be very
 
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
difficult to for that one assessor who
 
02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
might only work a few days a week to go
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
out and dig through journals and dig
 
02:04:22.830 --> 02:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
through other places to find out who's
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
generating carbon Credit in their area
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
so um I I I don't think uh those who are
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
generating them currently are going to
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
go out of their way to divulge that
 
02:04:38.350 --> 02:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
information um voluntarily so how would
 
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
you would they find out who is on
 
02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
generating these credits um my
 
02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:47.270 align:start position:0%
generating these credits um my
homeowners

02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
association has 34 Acres of forest
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
behind it uh and because of the fact
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
that it was required in the subdivision
 
02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
and also that it's very Steep and wet uh
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to build on it
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
anyway but we did do a cut 30 years ago
 
02:05:15.149 --> 02:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
but the cut that we did recently was to
 
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
get rid of 90-year-old Pines that were
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
totally useless for anything and
 
02:05:22.510 --> 02:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
therefore cost us quite a bit of money
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure the houses didn't get
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
destroyed so um how you wouldn't be able
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
to do it by how much they how often
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
they're taking the trees
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
out they may be saving the up for the
 
02:05:41.510 --> 02:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
purposes of having a 50-year-old tree
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
that is in Prime condition to
 
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
sell how would you how would you be able
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
to find out there were uh they had a
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
carbon credit contract I appreciate the
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you the I I so the other
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
bill that I have working in in resources
 
02:06:01.629 --> 02:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
and Recreation development I'm what I'm
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
asking in that bill is that we begin the
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
disclosure process so much like we have
 
02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
an intent to cut that's filed uh right
 
02:06:09.950 --> 02:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
now currently I'm asking that an intent
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
to generate be created um starting this
 
02:06:15.549 --> 02:06:15.559 align:start position:0%
year next year um that would begin to
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
divulge that information so that we are
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
more clear on the situation
 
02:06:23.629 --> 02:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
um the uh with without the additional
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
framework around a tax without the
 
02:06:26.549 --> 02:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
additional framework around a Timber tax
 
02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
I also want to caution against the um
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
the the focus on smaller plots um the 34
 
02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
Acres you're talking about the the the
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
effect on the forest industry is is
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
minor um when we look at the what is
 
02:06:41.709 --> 02:06:41.719 align:start position:0%
currently going on on those plots of
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
land majority of uh New Hampshire
 
02:06:46.990 --> 02:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
current use owners are in that 10 10
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
acre to 25 acre 10 acre to 100 Acre
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
category the majority of owners are in
 
02:06:53.109 --> 02:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
there but the majority of land is in
 
02:06:55.350 --> 02:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
that much larger category where we talk
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
about institutional investors owning
 
02:06:59.629 --> 02:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
huge huge tracks of formerly formerly
 
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
paper company and Lumber Company land um
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
that is now still being used for
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
industrial Timber production um that's
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
where the risk to the industry really
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
lies um the the currently California and
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
many other exchanges require 100 Acre
 
02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
parcel to be uh to generate a carbon
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
credit and the that requirement is to
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
take care of any of the the smaller uh
 
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
fluctuations that could happen around
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
the edges of a of a smaller parcel um so
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
that 100 Acre limit is already focusing
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
in on those those larger parcels and
 
02:07:34.709 --> 02:07:34.719 align:start position:0%
that's where the the the chance for
 
02:07:35.870 --> 02:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
these investors that's why they're
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
looking for those
 
02:07:43.069 --> 02:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
Parcels follow up yes uh behind our land
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh there is 150 acres of forest and
 
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
Wetland that um I I am on my
 
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
$500,000 of our our saved money to um
 
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
join with the local Land Trust which is
 
02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
join with the local Land Trust which is
the

02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:08.189 --> 02:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
owner would they have
 
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
to to um go out of current use so thank
 
02:08:14.910 --> 02:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
you again for the question because there
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
is not going to be cutting I believe the
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
the when when current use was
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
established in 1973 79a was was
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
established alongside of 79b and 79d
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
which established the the rules for
 
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
easements it was also established along
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
with 4477 45 the definition for an e a
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
private easement um all of those were
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
were set apart that they set them aside
 
02:08:39.149 --> 02:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
so that nonprofit and and non uh and
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
then uh locally owned properties they
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
are not currently under that current use
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
designation um or if they the the there
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
they have a wholly separate section of
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
law to deal with them um I think that
 
02:08:54.189 --> 02:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting that the
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
disclosures required by for 7745 which
 
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
require the uh any encumbrance on the
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
property be transmitted on the deed and
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
be transmitted to the registry of deeds
 
02:09:06.510 --> 02:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
is I don't believe is currently being
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
done by the majority of people
 
02:09:09.069 --> 02:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
generating carbon credits in the state
 
02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that's an incumbrance
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
on the property it's a 100-year contract
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
that could last forever that's another
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
one of those questions that we as a
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
state need to address and if we allow
 
02:09:20.069 --> 02:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
institutional investors to come in in
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
the next 12 months and really take
 
02:09:25.149 --> 02:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
advantage of a booming Market we risk
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
situation representative PL I don't
 
02:09:33.629 --> 02:09:33.639 align:start position:0%
understand at all how can you the land
 
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
is there the trees are there so you you
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
sign a contract for a carbon credit so
 
02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
trees were already there and so how is
 
02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:44.119 align:start position:0%
this increase anything uh to me it's
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
paricle but but maybe you can give me a
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
feedback on that what's it do does it uh
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow cutting eventually it has
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
to be cut or it falls down so so what
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
what is new here so I I agree it's
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
considered an alternative investment
 
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle um which by its definition is a
 
02:10:04.549 --> 02:10:04.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle which is an investment that by
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
its own has no real value so yes I agree
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
with you that it is very difficult to
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
wrap your head around why we would pay
 
02:10:15.069 --> 02:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
and Es specifically why we would pay
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
areas where there was already
 
02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
conservation going on New Hampshire has
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
over 50% of the State 53% of the State
 
02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
is in in current use that doesn't count
 
02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
the conservation land that work the
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
White Mountain National Forest uh the
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
state parks that we have that all work
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
alongside the current use program to
 
02:10:34.510 --> 02:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
give us the 84% Forest cover that we
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
have in the state which has been 84%
 
02:10:39.629 --> 02:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
since 1949 when the original Timber tax
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
was passed so to me this is a way to
 
02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
monetize something and to get a quick
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
buck and to get people to pay you for
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
something that requires the less people
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
on the ground it requires less
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
investment and as it was described in
 
02:10:57.069 --> 02:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
last week's committee less of the
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
Chainsaw swingers and more of the techie
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
guys um so that's that's my issue with
 
02:11:06.910 --> 02:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
it yes representative
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
Bolton thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question but I know like
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
Main and New Hampshire are the most
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
forested States and the Union why would
 
02:11:16.470 --> 02:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
someone go to something that's probably
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
like um less of an investment to get um
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
carbon credit monies versus making it a
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
wood lot and harvesting Timber so thank
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
you um I think specifically in New
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's why we're here in New
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we have one of the as it
 
02:11:36.189 --> 02:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
was described by the uh by nhtoa one of
 
02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
the simplest and best current use
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
programs in the country uh it's simple
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require the other uh
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
requirements from Vermont or Maine and
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
we give a massive amount of money
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
towards it um and for what it's worth it
 
02:11:51.709 --> 02:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
was a huge success it's been a huge
 
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
success you know I live in Berlin I live
 
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
I grew up in Randolph I surrounded by
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
current use land and I loved being part
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
of the forest um and I wouldn't have had
 
02:12:01.149 --> 02:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
that opportunity probably without the
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
current use rules that we have today um
 
02:12:06.750 --> 02:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
but we you know if we look at Vermont
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
for example Vermont has a 25 acre
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
requirement we only have a 10 acre
 
02:12:13.229 --> 02:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
requirement it requires a much more
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
robust Force management plan we only add
 
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
a Subs we only add an additional
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
discount if you have a forest management
 
02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
plan um Vermont's uh you know the the
 
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont estimated that the
 
02:12:28.549 --> 02:12:28.559 align:start position:0%
average median uh taxpayer in Vermont
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
who has land under current use saves
 
02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:31.510 align:start position:0%
who has land under current use saves
about

02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
33% um and when we look at property tax
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
rates between New Hampshire and Vermont
 
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
we are remarkably close 1.93 versus 1.9
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
effective property tax rate so if a if a
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh program where the current use rates
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
for Forest land are double what they are
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so we with a forest
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
Steward for Forest stewardship plan um
 
02:12:58.750 --> 02:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
on the high end gives 65 uh dollars per
 
02:13:01.950 --> 02:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
per uh per acre uh Vermont starts at1
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
145 so we are looking at a you know
 
02:13:08.549 --> 02:13:08.559 align:start position:0%
Vermont gives 33% I my by my estimation
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
just using those numbers we are looking
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
at close to a
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
66% property tax uh abatement from the
 
02:13:17.709 --> 02:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
current use program compared to Maine
 
02:13:19.629 --> 02:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
same type of thing so their Pro program
 
02:13:21.270 --> 02:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
set up where it's a base rate off of
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
your tax rate so it's 10% for if you
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
have a forest St Ste uh stewardship plan
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
it's an additional 20% on top of that if
 
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
you allow Recreation on the on the um
 
02:13:33.870 --> 02:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
property it's an additional F 10% if you
 
02:13:35.470 --> 02:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
do some other character some other
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
factors in there so uh we give a great
 
02:13:41.470 --> 02:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
subsidy which makes us a uh a great
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:49.870 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.069 --> 02:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:17.189 --> 02:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
bueron good afternoon Mr chairman
 
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Dan burger
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm the chief of the wildlife
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
division at the New Hampshire fishing
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
game department um I note that there's a
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
number of other people here to speak so
 
02:14:27.790 --> 02:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
I'll try and keep our our points brief
 
02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
um so um our Fishing Game Commission um
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
sets positions on all potential
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
legislation um they have voted to oppose
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
this one of the main concerns that um
 
02:14:41.069 --> 02:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
the department has with this bill um and
 
02:14:44.189 --> 02:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
I I believe um I'd heard one of one of
 
02:14:46.669 --> 02:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
the representatives mention this is that
 
02:14:49.549 --> 02:14:49.559 align:start position:0%
um our concern is what this will do if
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
you remove the incentives to keep um
 
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
land in Forest land um what are the
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and and the potential to
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
lose land to development um by removing
 
02:15:03.549 --> 02:15:03.559 align:start position:0%
um you know the the possibility of
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
putting it in current use um some of
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
these properties likely have multiple
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
things going on um you know sale of
 
02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
carbon credits as well as as active
 
02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
forestry um obviously that will vary
 
02:15:17.549 --> 02:15:17.559 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the lot um and
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
and the the drivers of the property
 
02:15:23.830 --> 02:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
owner um um but again we we feel um the
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
current language here um has the
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
potential to remove a fair portion of
 
02:15:31.549 --> 02:15:31.559 align:start position:0%
land from forest Land by removing the
 
02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
incentive um and we have a concern about
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
that we would much prefer standing
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
Forest whether it's mature um or young
 
02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
um versus developed
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
land thank you any
 
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you oh I'm
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
sorry tell me your name and Dan beron

02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
do I have H cards for them as well or

do I have H cards for them as well or
okay

02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
okay

02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau as a federation's policy director
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
no program is more important to work I'm
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
sorry could you
 
02:16:42.669 --> 02:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
introduce sorry well you could introduce
 
02:16:45.389 --> 02:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
me I'm Jason stock executive director of
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
Association good good morning afternoon
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
actually no program is more important to
 
02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
working farms and Forest in the state
 
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
than current use and as the bill sponsor
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledged the program works current
 
02:17:03.429 --> 02:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
use Is An Open Space
 
02:17:05.709 --> 02:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
Program Forest land used for an
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
emissions Reduction Program is still
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
open space Forest Land We oppose the
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
current use program being used for other
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
public policy objectives other than open
 
02:17:19.870 --> 02:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
space assessment as the bill does know
 
02:17:21.629 --> 02:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
that Farmland can also be used to
 
02:17:25.629 --> 02:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
credits want to touch on one thing that
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
was also mentioned by the sponsor that
 
02:17:33.629 --> 02:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
current use is not a subsidy program it
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
is simply an assessment of land at its
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
current use
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
value please recommend the bill as itl
 
02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:44.110 align:start position:0%
value please recommend the bill as itl
thank

02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:17:46.990 --> 02:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
you again uh Jason stock New Hampshire
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
Timberland owner ERS Association and I
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
to have come today before you to speak
 
02:17:54.750 --> 02:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill as Rob said
 
02:17:57.389 --> 02:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
it's open space law there's two criteria
 
02:17:58.990 --> 02:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
to get into current
 
02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
use obviously open space undeveloped and
 
02:18:06.429 --> 02:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
greater than 10 acres and as the prior
 
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
one of the prior sponsors mentioned the
 
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
Simplicity of our law makes it the Envy
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
in many other states when it comes to
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
open space it doesn't become encumbered
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
with other public policy issues concerns
 
02:18:24.990 --> 02:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
that can change with administrations and
 
02:18:27.389 --> 02:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
and change with the political winds and
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
this level of stability has made our law
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
very very secure and very
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
effective I also want to point out
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
that land enrolled in carbon
 
02:18:43.389 --> 02:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
programs can be cut and is harvested
 
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
harvesting does occur on these
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
properties it's not an All or Nothing
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
proposition so I see some I see some
 
02:18:55.950 --> 02:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
some some some grimaces so and there are
 
02:18:57.150 --> 02:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
others that can speak to the
 
02:18:59.549 --> 02:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
technicalities but the simplest way to
 
02:19:02.429 --> 02:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
put it is is that someone is purchasing
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
your carbon the carbon that's growing on
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
your property they aren't necessarily
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing every single stick of wood
 
02:19:11.469 --> 02:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
that's growing on there you can either
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
subscribe to a management program that
 
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
says all right we're going to cut x% of
 
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
growth and that excess growth will then
 
02:19:24.309 --> 02:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
be sold sold into a carbon program there
 
02:19:26.830 --> 02:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
are way each deal is different and each
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
wheel each deal gets each deal gets
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
negotiated sales of carbon in many
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
respects are no different it is a it is
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
a asset it's like selling a conservation
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
easement it's like selling a development
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
right it's like someone coming along my
 
02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
neighbor comes along and says Jason I
 
02:19:47.589 --> 02:19:47.599 align:start position:0%
really love the way you maintain those
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
Trails on your property I'd like to pay
 
02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
you X doll to continue to maintain those
 
02:19:56.349 --> 02:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
Trails on your property it's the sale of
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
an asset or the sale a s a private
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
transaction between two parties on
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
either an asset in this case carbon or a
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
practice um and so I want to make sure
 
02:20:10.349 --> 02:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
that folks understand that it's not an
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
All or Nothing proposition we as an
 
02:20:16.590 --> 02:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
organization we have quite consciously
 
02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
decided not to get into the debate of
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not carbon trading is an
 
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
effective means of of of uh mitigating
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
global climate change but what we do
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
recognize is that it is a
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
Marketplace car and it is a a an
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for land owners to sell is
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
an asset that land owners can sell and
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
it is and it can provide in some cases
 
02:20:42.270 --> 02:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
an alternative Revenue stream and these
 
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
are private transactions between two
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
individuals um in so with that I'll I'll
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I'm happy to try
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions as I have said
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
there are others behind me that know the
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
intricacies of these programs and these
 
02:21:03.309 --> 02:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
markets much more deeply than I do thank
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
you representative PL yes you say that
 
02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh current use simply requires open
 
02:21:12.670 --> 02:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
space greater than 10 acres is there any
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
requirement to cut
 
02:21:17.790 --> 02:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
timber great question there is not okay
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
so it could be yes it's the same
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
question it could be possible that there
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
is no revenue generated from current use
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh if uh at all uh because there's no
 
02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
Timber cut but uh T Timber should
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
eventually would the land owner probably
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
would cut it to keep the keep keep the
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
forest younger shall we say great
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
question there is no obligation to cut
 
02:21:48.030 --> 02:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
timber so I can buy buy a piece of land
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
and have it in current use and I can say
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
my personal management objectives is to
 
02:21:58.349 --> 02:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
grow old growth that's what I want to do
 
02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I can do it I can grow I can buy a
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
piece of Timberland en roll it in
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
current use and say my objectives are to
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
grow Upland bird hunting habitat and I
 
02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
can do a lot of patch and small clear
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
cuts across that property because that's
 
02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
my objective that's a personal decision
 
02:22:19.870 --> 02:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.309 --> 02:22:23.319 align:start position:0%
makes representative fellows um yes do
 
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
any of your members um have they sold
 
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
land to other companies so they can get
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
the carbon
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
credits I'm or and the the other part is
 
02:22:37.389 --> 02:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
it does it have to be sold or can it be
 
02:22:41.469 --> 02:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
leased I great question I'm aware of of
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
three members that have that have
 
02:22:46.670 --> 02:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
entered into carbon programs they don't
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
sell the real estate they maintain the
 
02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
real estate and in these instances they
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
are selling the credits similar is if
 
02:22:57.150 --> 02:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
you own a piece of real estate and you
 
02:22:59.790 --> 02:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
sell a development rights to someone or
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
you sell a right of way and so there are
 
02:23:05.070 --> 02:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm aware of at least three
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
members um that have entered into these
 
02:23:10.349 --> 02:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any kind of
 
02:23:12.830 --> 02:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
transactions or pricing or anything I
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
just know they have mentioned to me yes
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
when I look at my management objectives
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
and I look at the carbon programs it
 
02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
fits with what I want to do with my real
 
02:23:25.389 --> 02:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
estate and therefore I felt comfortable
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
entering into this can can I just follow
 
02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
up follow
 
02:23:31.630 --> 02:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
up this is hard for me to understand
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
because it's all new so if I owned a
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
land somehow in I make a transaction
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
with whoever wants to buy these carbon
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
credits and they give me some
 
02:23:47.950 --> 02:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
money and
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
could be a lot of
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
money and is it do they pay yearly or
 
02:23:55.030 --> 02:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
you think or one time or whatever it is
 
02:23:57.790 --> 02:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
they get a lot of money from it but
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
they've done nothing to the land but
 
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
clearly the land was worth something
 
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
because they got money for it so they
 
02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
don't really seem to fit within the
 
02:24:14.429 --> 02:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
intent of they don't it doesn't seem
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
like they should belong in the category
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
of current use that's the same as Forest
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
lands because the value is higher if if
 
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
they have or if they could sell these
 
02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
credits yeah it it's it's like Jason
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
said earli it's not an All or Nothing
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
proposition they're still managing the
 
02:24:43.269 --> 02:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
differently I'm sort of asking yeah I'm
 
02:24:49.150 --> 02:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
asking about the the I'm questioning
 
02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
that if they have the opportunity to do
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
this then the land has greater value
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
than it's being taxed at because its
 
02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:05.309 align:start position:0%
than it's being taxed at because its
current

02:25:05.309 --> 02:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
use yeah so that the land isn't first
 
02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
off the land is not what is being sold
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
here I am selling I am selling
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
carbon and that continues to grow
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
my trees grow the land continues to be
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
open space and therefore qualify for
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
current use assessment at some point in
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
time and as you've heard these contracts
 
02:25:32.469 --> 02:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
can vary from one year to 99 years at
 
02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
some point in time the contract ends and
 
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
at that point I can cut those trees and
 
02:25:42.150 --> 02:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
at that point I will pay a Timber SE a
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
severance tax to the to the to the local
 
02:25:47.950 --> 02:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
municipality but in the the
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
interim I am I am I've I've done a
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
transaction I am selling carbon it's the
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
same as if I sell a right of way an
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
easement um I can you know these are all
 
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable transactions that can occur
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
on open space land and that land can
 
02:26:08.830 --> 02:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
remain in current under current use
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
assessment as long as I don't build on
 
02:26:15.269 --> 02:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
it pave it or subdivide it and sell it
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
so it's less than 10 acres
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
just to add to that you're not
 
02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily making more you may be you
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
may not be it's been it's a it's the way
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
the land owner wishes their land to be
 
02:26:33.630 --> 02:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:37.269 --> 02:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
that yes representative
 
02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you um so can you talk a
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
little bit about how current use
 
02:26:49.469 --> 02:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
GL gladly so our our members many of
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
them I would say the vast majority of
 
02:26:58.469 --> 02:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
them their land is in is is assessed is
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
taxed and assessed under current use
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
assessment um this tax law is one that
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
as as Rob had mentioned I'm being taxed
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
on my ability to grow ra raspberries and
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
strawberries or corn and silage or to or
 
02:27:22.110 --> 02:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
to grow or to grow trees um and so why
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
our interest in this is that this tax
 
02:27:27.389 --> 02:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
policy is one that the almost I would
 
02:27:30.230 --> 02:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
say almost all our members particip this
 
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
assessment Pro program is one almost all
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
our assessment all our members excuse me
 
02:27:35.359 --> 02:27:36.790 align:start position:0%
our assessment all our members excuse me
participate

02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
participate
 
02:27:39.870 --> 02:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
in for many current use land owners if
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
their properties were assessed at full
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
market value at ADV vorum they could not
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
afford to hold on to it the property and
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
then way it's not available for
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
recreational use for wildlife uh you
 
02:27:54.190 --> 02:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
name it the TR it's it's key to the our
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
state's tourism
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
industry thank you may I may I have a
 
02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
followup followup so um this is ways a
 
02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.389 align:start position:0%
followup followup so um this is ways a
means

02:28:04.389 --> 02:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
and it's our job to to figure out how to
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
run the state right to get income so
 
02:28:13.349 --> 02:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
that we can continue to run the state so
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
I'm totally
 
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.750 align:start position:0%
I'm totally
value

02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
value
 
02:28:19.710 --> 02:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
what what is happening right like I
 
02:28:22.349 --> 02:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
totally value open use totally value
 
02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
Farmland but it sounds like what we're
 
02:28:27.389 --> 02:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
describing is an alternative Revenue
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
source for people who own this land that
 
02:28:33.550 --> 02:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
currently isn't being taxed so there's a
 
02:28:35.710 --> 02:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
couple ways to look at that and that's
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
our job because we make policy um one
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
way is to say well you know we
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
don't care because we don't tax income
 
02:28:47.469 --> 02:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
it's income
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh I guess my question is if we are
 
02:28:53.710 --> 02:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
giving someone a tax
 
02:28:56.830 --> 02:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
break because they can't otherwise
 
02:28:59.950 --> 02:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
afford to do these practices that makes
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
sense to me but if there's another new
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream that didn't exist in the
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
70s that exists today it seems like it
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
would make sense for us to understand at
 
02:29:15.030 --> 02:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
the very least what kind of
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue um people are able to make in
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
the way that they're using their land
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
right um so they're using their land in
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
a way that's generating Revenue so I'm
 
02:29:33.550 --> 02:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
trying to understand um if if you have
 
02:29:35.550 --> 02:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
any understanding
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
of how that is changing the ball game
 
02:29:41.309 --> 02:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
and if you can give us some insight
 
02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
there sure we're not necessarily opposed
 
02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
to taxing but not not through the
 
02:29:49.469 --> 02:29:49.479 align:start position:0%
current use program and Jason can
 
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that thank you and as you
 
02:29:54.790 --> 02:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
heard earlier there's a there's another
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
bill it's being heard by the resources
 
02:29:59.550 --> 02:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
Recreation development committee it
 
02:30:03.110 --> 02:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
looks at creating a a a carbon
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
tax um in this case using RSA 79 which
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
is the state Timber tax law so it would
 
02:30:13.870 --> 02:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
create that I testified on that bill
 
02:30:18.269 --> 02:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
that communities can all already tax
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
uncut wood RSA 795 allows because this
 
02:30:25.269 --> 02:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
is a local tax we're talking about RSA
 
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
795 allows a municipality to cut un or
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me tax uncut wood most folks
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't are unaware of it I see
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative Al criming but that's on
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
the books it's never been used to my
 
02:30:46.269 --> 02:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge I've spoken to Folks at Dr
 
02:30:48.110 --> 02:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
they have never heard of it being used
 
02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
but it's on the books and well it's been
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
on the books since day one of the the of
 
02:30:56.429 --> 02:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
the Timber tax which is going back to
 
02:31:00.910 --> 02:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
the 40s and my testimony last week was
 
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
is that if you what wish to car if you
 
02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
wish to assess a tax on carbon sales
 
02:31:10.510 --> 02:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
there's a vehicle already in in statute
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
look at that vehicle and have Dr they
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
already have the authority have them
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
develop some some rules around that so A
 
02:31:23.790 --> 02:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
municipality can in fact assess that
 
02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
tax the mechanism's there they can do it
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
and so modifying current use we think is
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and even the even the the
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
timber tax bill we don't need it you can
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
already assess a tax on uncut wood in
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities need guidance and our our
 
02:31:47.110 --> 02:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
our testimony
 
02:31:50.790 --> 02:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
was let's let the tax and the timber tax
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
experts let's let them and the
 
02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
biometricians and the Foresters and so
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
forth let's let them work on it and and
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
come forth with a
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
proposal um but just modifying current
 
02:32:06.469 --> 02:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
use is not going to that's not the
 
02:32:09.030 --> 02:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's not the solution representative
 
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
Ellery thank you yeah thank you uh thank
 
02:32:15.389 --> 02:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question previously I
 
02:32:17.950 --> 02:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
thought I heard you say that you know of
 
02:32:21.389 --> 02:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
at least two or three uh contracts that
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
are already in
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
existence it is that
 
02:32:30.630 --> 02:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
correct yes a followup Mr
 
02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:32.429 align:start position:0%
correct yes a followup Mr
chair

02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:32:32.439 --> 02:32:34.590 align:start position:0%
chair
yeah

02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:32:39.070 --> 02:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
so it's John so if they're already in
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
existence if these contracts are already
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
in existence why do we need to do
 
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
anything excellent
 
02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
question also I would add that this is
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
after kind after the
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
fact do they do those properties they've
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
entered into these contracts being
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
assessed under current use do they do
 
02:33:06.190 --> 02:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
they now does this now retroactively go
 
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
after those properties and those land
 
02:33:11.269 --> 02:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
owners I I I agree I think the
 
02:33:13.389 --> 02:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution has something to say about
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
that but again this is this is the you
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
know the rabbit hole we find ourselves
 
02:33:22.269 --> 02:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
wandering down with this piece of
 
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and thank you for your
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.670 --> 02:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
ol yes representative yes uh I don't
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
know if there's anyone here from the
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
society for protection of New Hampshire
 
02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
forests but if there isn't could are
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay believe they plan to speak I think
 
02:33:45.389 --> 02:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
that it's important that there be some
 
02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh description of what New Hampshire was
 
02:33:51.550 --> 02:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
like in uh
 
02:33:57.150 --> 02:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
1912 and uh why the current use was put
 
02:33:57.160 --> 02:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
1912 and uh why the current use was put
in

02:33:59.269 --> 02:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:34:06.110 --> 02:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
it I I I I wasn't here back in 1912 um
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay but the current use law the current
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
use law did go into effect the current
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
use law did go into effect and the
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
actually this this particular law went
 
02:34:16.750 --> 02:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
into effect in this in the the late
 
02:34:19.630 --> 02:34:19.640 align:start position:0%
late 60s actually and it actually
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
involved the Constitutional Amendment
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so forth but at the time the state
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and Rob touched on this you had
 
02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:28.710 align:start position:0%
um and Rob touched on this you had
property

02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:31.479 align:start position:0%
values um you had kind of tree farms
 
02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
getting assessed as if they were house
 
02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:36.190 align:start position:0%
getting assessed as if they were house
lots

02:34:36.190 --> 02:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
lots
 
02:34:40.990 --> 02:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
and that kind of imbalance in in that
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
imbalance created a problem where land
 
02:34:45.389 --> 02:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
owners are facing tax bills that are in
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
that are being inter appropriately or
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps appropriately but they're being
 
02:34:52.830 --> 02:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
assessed at a use that they don't that
 
02:34:55.150 --> 02:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
their property isn't if I'm growing
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
field corn to feed my dairy cows but boy
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a nice house
 
02:35:02.550 --> 02:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
site you see the the disparity and so
 
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's why current use was developed was
 
02:35:06.670 --> 02:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
say all right if you're growing corn
 
02:35:08.030 --> 02:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to assess you as if you're
 
02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
corn ground and the other thing I I'll
 
02:35:12.389 --> 02:35:12.399 align:start position:0%
mention is that when that land does get
 
02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
developed let's say it gets developed
 
02:35:16.349 --> 02:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
down the road there is a penalty assess
 
02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
so the town does receive revenue from
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
from that property above and beyond the
 
02:35:24.750 --> 02:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
current use assessment and then at that
 
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
point once it's developed it's taxed ADV
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
VOR any other
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:37.910 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
thank

02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:44.960 --> 02:36:06.870 align:start position:0%

good morning uh my name is Tom Thompson
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to read my uh
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:20.910 --> 02:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
Laura sber and chair who I believe is
 
02:36:23.269 --> 02:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
not here and committee members my name
 
02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
is Tom Tompson representing the Thompson
 
02:36:28.990 --> 02:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
Family Tree Farm located in Orford New
 
02:36:31.389 --> 02:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also for the
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
record I serve on the New Hampshire
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
current use Advisory Board which is
 
02:36:37.790 --> 02:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of Revenue
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
Administration I'm here today to testify
 
02:36:43.269 --> 02:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
in opposition of House Bill
 
02:36:45.990 --> 02:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
1484 the sponsor of this bill wants to
 
02:36:48.429 --> 02:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
exclude land which is in the current use
 
02:36:51.030 --> 02:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
program if a landowner signs up for
 
02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:52.070 align:start position:0%
program if a landowner signs up for
carbon

02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
credits does that mean he also wants the
 
02:36:57.830 --> 02:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
landowner to pay the current use change
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
tax because that was not clear in in the
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is inconsistent with the
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
current use law as a contract for carbon
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
credits is not a change in the use of
 
02:37:13.950 --> 02:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
open space land
 
02:37:16.910 --> 02:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
law I believe house bill
 
02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
18 I'm sorry
 
02:37:23.469 --> 02:37:23.479 align:start position:0%
1484 is a knee-jerk reaction to a
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
recently new large land owner who owns
 
02:37:28.990 --> 02:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lake Headwaters in Northern
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who signed up for carbon
 
02:37:34.590 --> 02:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
credits while cutting back on harvesting
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
Timber I encourage you to kill this Bill
 
02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:38.710 align:start position:0%
Timber I encourage you to kill this Bill
thank

02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:37:41.070 --> 02:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you will you take any
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
questions yes I will do we have any
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:46.590 align:start position:0%
question yes
representative

02:37:46.590 --> 02:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:37:48.670 --> 02:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
so representative Aly mentioned earlier
 
02:37:58.030 --> 02:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh back in the early 1900s I believe New
 
02:38:01.309 --> 02:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was mostly deforested in terms
 
02:38:05.230 --> 02:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
of maybe it was 20% Woods 80% other
 
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
somebody back there shaking their head
 
02:38:08.429 --> 02:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
and those so hopefully they'll tell us
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
what that percentage is uh my question
 
02:38:15.469 --> 02:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
is if the trees are sitting there in
 
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
their in uh they're being held in what
 
02:38:22.429 --> 02:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
Forest as forested land excuse me at
 
02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
what point did they become a hazard I
 
02:38:28.349 --> 02:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
mean trees don't stay there forever so I
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
mean so these trees that are being set
 
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
aside like if it's what is it 10 acres
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
or more do those trees eventually get
 
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
harvested so they're not creating a fire
 
02:38:40.710 --> 02:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
hazard or you know if we manage the land
 
02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
the animals do better you can't let the
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
forest always
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
mature otherwise it otherwise you
 
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
actually uh hurt the wildlife so I guess
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is then how is this land
 
02:38:55.469 --> 02:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
managed in most cases and I will share
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
with you in our case which we have we
 
02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
have a we are certified tree farmers and
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh we manage it in a sustainable manner
 
02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
we we uh Harvest Timber uh we protect
 
02:39:10.269 --> 02:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
the water quality we enhance W life
 
02:39:13.870 --> 02:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
habitat and uh allow Recreation on our
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
property and um
 
02:39:19.469 --> 02:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
the the first question that you asked
 
02:39:21.750 --> 02:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
about the back in
 
02:39:26.309 --> 02:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
1912 uh those figures are fairly close
 
02:39:29.950 --> 02:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh you remember back late 1800s uh there
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
were huge sheep farms all over the the
 
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and therefore
 
02:39:36.670 --> 02:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
that there was not as much Forest it has
 
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
just completely reversed now because uh
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
the tree farm organizations and other
 
02:39:45.269 --> 02:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
land organizations in this state have
 
02:39:48.990 --> 02:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
done a remarkable job in uh sustainable
 
02:39:51.750 --> 02:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
forestry and and I will also point out
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
to you that U on those lands
 
02:39:59.070 --> 02:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm talking about my property we
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
own 2600 acres in the state of New
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we open it and share it with
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
the general public uh we uh allow
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling uh that brings into this
 
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
state uh there's 7200 miles of
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trails across the state
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh 84% of those are are on private land
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
such as ours and it brings into the
 
02:40:24.269 --> 02:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
state direct and indirect over $600
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
million every year but it doesn't stop
 
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
there we open it for uh hunting and
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
fishing uh uh hiking
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
um all types of of of foot traffic on
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
our property and we saw a huge increase
 
02:40:46.349 --> 02:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
in all of that uh during Co and and we
 
02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
enjoy uh sharing our land and and we as
 
02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
land owners allowing all of that
 
02:40:55.110 --> 02:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
activity on our property we don't get
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
one nickel from the state or the general
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
public and we're not asking for that
 
02:41:03.269 --> 02:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
there is a insurance policy uh that the
 
02:41:05.469 --> 02:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
Bureau of trails puts out uh that
 
02:41:07.070 --> 02:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
protects us particularly for
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling but other than that all of
 
02:41:12.910 --> 02:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
that is giving to the state and to the
 
02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:14.429 align:start position:0%
that is giving to the state and to the
public

02:41:14.429 --> 02:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:41:19.110 --> 02:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh we do have our land in current use um
 
02:41:22.269 --> 02:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
just a word about current use uh the
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
reason it was developed and and came
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
into being back in
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
1968 and it had to go through the
 
02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment which is a very
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
high bar to to go
 
02:41:36.389 --> 02:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
under U it was because the Southern Tier
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire was being destroyed a
 
02:41:42.750 --> 02:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
farms uh Open Spaces were being uh
 
02:41:46.110 --> 02:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
subdivided left and right and uh
 
02:41:48.750 --> 02:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
and people in in this state came
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
together and decided that they wanted to
 
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
protect the open land in in the state
 
02:41:58.230 --> 02:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
for everyone to enjoy and it took 5
 
02:42:01.230 --> 02:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
years just to get from the the very
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
beginning to in 1973 when that law was
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
signed into into law and uh it's now
 
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
over 50 years that we've had a very uh
 
02:42:14.269 --> 02:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
successful current use in the state of
 
02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it was one of the early
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
ones in many states across this country
 
02:42:23.710 --> 02:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
have tried to copy that uh and U it it
 
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons is because we've kept
 
02:42:28.630 --> 02:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
it simple it's simple to for a land
 
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
owner to get involved in it uh keep in
 
02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
mind that when that happens and we have
 
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
to go through a a process with the town
 
02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
mapping out our property the forest
 
02:42:44.830 --> 02:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
Farmland Etc uh then it the final point
 
02:42:47.070 --> 02:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
is it get it's it's there is a lean on
 
02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:54.630 --> 02:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
deeds any other
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent
 
02:43:01.870 --> 02:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
Lori thank you for taking my question
 
02:43:03.870 --> 02:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
thank you there's a current move that
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
I've heard about and seen described in
 
02:43:10.510 --> 02:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
different literature or regarding air
 
02:43:12.309 --> 02:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
rights above
 
02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
property would this legislation or any
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
or similar legislation prevent someone
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
from taking air
 
02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
rights I as you have in say New York
 
02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
City where uh you have a building but
 
02:43:30.950 --> 02:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
that building is here and then the the
 
02:43:32.309 --> 02:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
air above
 
02:43:35.030 --> 02:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
it can belong to somebody else so that
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have a shadow cast by a tall
 
02:43:40.190 --> 02:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
building and some sort of I hope we
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
never get to that point yeah well so do
 
02:43:45.269 --> 02:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
I but that's why I ask the only shadow
 
02:43:48.429 --> 02:43:48.439 align:start position:0%
might be is because we grow big
 
02:43:51.349 --> 02:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
trees well not as big as Washington but
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
no we don't you're right all right thank
 
02:44:01.590 --> 02:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:11.309 --> 02:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
wood thank you chair committee
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:15.790 align:start position:0%
wood thank you chair committee
um

Buton we
 
02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
go Tomy why'd you push this button um
 
02:44:24.309 --> 02:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself as well in the
 
02:44:27.269 --> 02:44:27.279 align:start position:0%
course of it sir I'm I'm Steven Wood uh
 
02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
I and my wife um own and manage poverty
 
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
Lane Orchards and fum Hill ciders in
 
02:44:36.670 --> 02:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and planfield we and our and her
 
02:44:39.550 --> 02:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
family uh own uh a combination of about,
 
02:44:41.870 --> 02:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
1400 acres in Lebanon planfield and
 
02:44:45.309 --> 02:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
Dublin all of which is under current use
 
02:44:47.429 --> 02:44:47.439 align:start position:0%
that is eligible for current use and has
 
02:44:50.469 --> 02:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
been from the get-go I'm here just to
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
say others have said bits of what I
 
02:44:55.550 --> 02:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
would have said well
 
02:44:58.269 --> 02:44:58.279 align:start position:0%
enough New Hampshire's current use law
 
02:45:00.030 --> 02:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
is the best current use law in the
 
02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
country and it is stood the test of time
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
because it was so sharply written and
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
because the construct of that land use
 
02:45:12.910 --> 02:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
train uh change tax is so cleverly uh
 
02:45:17.309 --> 02:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
construed that it it it compensates
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities very well for for for
 
02:45:22.710 --> 02:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
land that finally comes out of current
 
02:45:25.469 --> 02:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
use while it gives them sometimes they
 
02:45:27.990 --> 02:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
don't notice this or agree with it but
 
02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
it gives them the benefit of having land
 
02:45:33.950 --> 02:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
that does not require Services doesn't
 
02:45:36.990 --> 02:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
require education doesn't it is in fact
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
that and it's been studied over and
 
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
again to be the best thing for
 
02:45:45.389 --> 02:45:45.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh for a taxpayer to have
 
02:45:48.269 --> 02:45:48.279 align:start position:0%
lots of undeveloped land in your on your
 
02:45:51.910 --> 02:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
in your town now we have we've managed
 
02:45:55.150 --> 02:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
an orchard and we are also uh Timber
 
02:45:58.269 --> 02:45:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:01.389 --> 02:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
Farmers Lebanon in particular our good
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
Orchard land and our good hardwood land
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
um is hugely developable and always has
 
02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
been and um we if we had to pay oh yeah
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
it's also open to the public in all
 
02:46:19.389 --> 02:46:19.399 align:start position:0%
manner of ways and we did you including
 
02:46:21.389 --> 02:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
our pick your own Orchards but also they
 
02:46:22.469 --> 02:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
use our
 
02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
forests um I mean I know Sue does it's
 
02:46:27.389 --> 02:46:27.399 align:start position:0%
right down the road from I mean
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I'm sorry um this
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
would be impossible we would not have
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
been able to continue to own this
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
land unless we wanted it to develop it
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
if we have been obliged to pay the taxes
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
for What's called the highest invest use
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
that is the highest market value for
 
02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
that land the taxes would wipe us out in
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
a a
 
02:46:54.190 --> 02:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
year the orchard wouldn't exist the
 
02:46:56.349 --> 02:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
forest wouldn't
 
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
exist please treat the New Hampshire
 
02:47:01.630 --> 02:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
current use law as sacct it's worked
 
02:47:04.030 --> 02:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
beautifully it should be treated like
 
02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution or the New Testament
 
02:47:10.429 --> 02:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
Cannon or something that you just don't
 
02:47:13.990 --> 02:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
mess around with it and as uh Mr stock
 
02:47:15.910 --> 02:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
pointed out there is a construct in
 
02:47:18.309 --> 02:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
state law that can address the issue
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
that is largely driving this
 
02:47:24.150 --> 02:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
suggestion I suggest that it is
 
02:47:26.670 --> 02:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to mess with a law that
 
02:47:30.110 --> 02:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
has served us so well for 50 years thank
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you um yes represen fellows so
 
02:47:38.590 --> 02:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
um you have two types of land it is the
 
02:47:42.750 --> 02:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
current use rate you're you're different
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the orchard versus the forest
 
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
there are there there are differences
 
02:47:49.710 --> 02:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
with within them somebody who uh
 
02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:51.279 align:start position:0%
actually knows the current use law as
 
02:47:52.990 --> 02:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
some people do here better than I do
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
could better explain this but we pay
 
02:47:57.910 --> 02:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
varying rates according to the uh
 
02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
potential productivity of of each sort
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
of land so even within an orchard there
 
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
can be uh different rates according to
 
02:48:09.550 --> 02:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
the soils ditto the ditto the forests uh
 
02:48:11.830 --> 02:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
White Pine Land is treated differently
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
from hardwood land is treated
 
02:48:17.230 --> 02:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
differently from Wetlands or shrub land
 
02:48:20.190 --> 02:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
or open land and the current use
 
02:48:25.150 --> 02:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board um together with Dr um
 
02:48:28.110 --> 02:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
works works out what those those lines
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
are and what those rights will
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
be so so if I looked at your tax card
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
yep the description I would see several
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
different Parcels of land with a no no
 
02:48:46.269 --> 02:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
you'd see one land one value of land
 
02:48:48.190 --> 02:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
under current use the current use value
 
02:48:51.469 --> 02:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
of the land um you would also
 
02:48:54.269 --> 02:48:54.279 align:start position:0%
see the I think you would say I can't I
 
02:48:55.710 --> 02:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
can't remember where they still put that
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
on but the the market value of the land
 
02:48:59.670 --> 02:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
which is which has no bearing on the tax
 
02:49:02.830 --> 02:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
we pay we pay the the tax based on the
 
02:49:05.550 --> 02:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
current use value which is the value
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
what is construed to be the value of the
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
land as it is currently being used and
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
again it's an open SP it's whole it its
 
02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
whole intent is to maintain open space
 
02:49:20.030 --> 02:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
which is what it does by doing the thing
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:25.590 --> 02:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
you follow up yeah I'm
 
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
so so I'm thinking that the orchard land
 
02:49:32.830 --> 02:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
must be worth more than the forest land
 
02:49:34.349 --> 02:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
but you only
 
02:49:37.870 --> 02:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
see one well I can they have different
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
rates I can go down to the to to to the
 
02:49:45.550 --> 02:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
city and look at at at the various
 
02:49:48.670 --> 02:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
rates that acre to my total value oh
 
02:49:51.030 --> 02:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I meant you have
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
multiple pieces that have different
 
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
values there yes I mean it's not it's
 
02:50:00.349 --> 02:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
not a huge they usually they they sort
 
02:50:03.229 --> 02:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
of mud things together a bit but there
 
02:50:05.229 --> 02:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
but yes there there there are different
 
02:50:07.229 --> 02:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
components of the value that I see on my
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
tax bill yes R and shamard thank you Mr
 
02:50:13.790 --> 02:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr wood uh they value
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
your land by a Matrix system do they
 
02:50:20.590 --> 02:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
not classifying the woods and
 
02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
the I I I'm not sure what a matrix
 
02:50:24.910 --> 02:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
system is
 
02:50:28.830 --> 02:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
Sir well um it's check on it I'm sure no
 
02:50:32.070 --> 02:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
I I I have um
 
02:50:35.070 --> 02:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
okay there there is a there is a scheme
 
02:50:38.670 --> 02:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
whereby they are obliged to apply a
 
02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
range for each sort of land as described
 
02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
if that is a m Matrix system
 
02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:48.110 align:start position:0%
if that is a m Matrix system
then

02:50:48.110 --> 02:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:50:53.630 --> 02:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
yes okay represent Aly just quickly on
 
02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
did you know that this is the way they
 
02:50:58.830 --> 02:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
were assessing land in
 
02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:00.790 align:start position:0%
were assessing land in
1770

02:51:00.790 --> 02:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
1770
 
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
whatever did I know what this that was
 
02:51:08.910 --> 02:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
the original way of assessing property
 
02:51:12.670 --> 02:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
was by it by its uh uh by its productive
 
02:51:15.309 --> 02:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
capacity or capability right
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
no I did not thank you for teaching me
 
02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
that all right do we have any other
 
02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:51:23.269 --> 02:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
much thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:51:26.030 --> 02:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
speak to you and for your
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
services you got
 
02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:30.190 align:start position:0%
services you got
uh

02:51:30.190 --> 02:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:51:41.150 --> 02:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:43.349 --> 02:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
lavesque thank you Mr chair members of
 
02:51:46.309 --> 02:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
the committee I'll try to be brief uh I
 
02:51:48.429 --> 02:51:48.439 align:start position:0%
wear several hats here today I live in
 
02:51:50.870 --> 02:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
antrum uh I have a natural resource
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
consulting firm but I also am the chair
 
02:51:56.110 --> 02:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
of something called the Statewide
 
02:51:58.269 --> 02:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
program of action to conserve our
 
02:52:01.309 --> 02:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
environment space space is actually the
 
02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that advocated
 
02:52:06.150 --> 02:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
for the current use law uh back in the
 
02:52:08.830 --> 02:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
1960s that led to the
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
1968 Constitutional Amendment allowing
 
02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
the law to be passed in 1973 to have
 
02:52:17.389 --> 02:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
current use so we are the current use
 
02:52:19.070 --> 02:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
Coalition a number of the folks who've
 
02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
already spoken here are members of our
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
board and so our our goal essentially is
 
02:52:27.110 --> 02:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
to maintain the current use program
 
02:52:28.990 --> 02:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
strong just like it is today because as
 
02:52:31.870 --> 02:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
other speakers have said it works really
 
02:52:34.269 --> 02:52:34.279 align:start position:0%
well and Most states in the country have
 
02:52:36.790 --> 02:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
a similar program New Hampshire's works
 
02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
better than any uh other in in the uh
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
country I won't repeat what's been said
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
before me but support uh all the
 
02:52:45.950 --> 02:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
arguments made by those who are in
 
02:52:49.150 --> 02:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill as am I and the
 
02:52:52.469 --> 02:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
space board uh I will say that um a
 
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
couple of points that haven't been
 
02:52:57.990 --> 02:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
covered include number one that this law
 
02:53:00.910 --> 02:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
is really a retro retrospective law and
 
02:53:03.349 --> 02:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
if you were to pass the bill as it's
 
02:53:06.510 --> 02:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
written um because current use has come
 
02:53:09.389 --> 02:53:09.399 align:start position:0%
under under this in previous bills over
 
02:53:12.309 --> 02:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
over the last 50 years you would have to
 
02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
allow current use land owners who own
 
02:53:17.030 --> 02:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
forest land out of the program because
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's retrospective they have a lean on
 
02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
their property it's filed at the
 
02:53:22.510 --> 02:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
registry when they sign up for current
 
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
use so essentially the way it's written
 
02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh as we have it before us this bill
 
02:53:31.309 --> 02:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
would only cover Forest land owners who
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
have yet to to apply for the program and
 
02:53:37.070 --> 02:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
and be part of it it could not cover any
 
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
current use land owners who are already
 
02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
in the program um a couple of other
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
points uh this is current uses not a
 
02:53:48.670 --> 02:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
subsidy that term has been used and what
 
02:53:50.670 --> 02:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
we need to remember is that when we had
 
02:53:52.670 --> 02:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
a constitutional amendment passed on
 
02:53:55.469 --> 02:53:55.479 align:start position:0%
this in ' 68 what it did in the
 
02:53:57.830 --> 02:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution and in state law is it set
 
02:54:02.590 --> 02:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
up a different taxing method so uh the
 
02:54:05.790 --> 02:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
current use method is equally legally
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
valid as a an assessment me method based
 
02:54:12.110 --> 02:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
on the current use of the land as is ADV
 
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
valorum which counts ENT the highest in
 
02:54:18.229 --> 02:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh value of the property based on the on
 
02:54:20.429 --> 02:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
the local zoning as a house lot as a
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
commercial lot so these are equally
 
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
valid you can't say one is a subsidy
 
02:54:26.309 --> 02:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
over the other they they're both valid
 
02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
under the Constitution and state law two
 
02:54:32.429 --> 02:54:32.439 align:start position:0%
other things and then I'll end um on
 
02:54:34.950 --> 02:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
Monday at 9:00 a.m. wearing a different
 
02:54:36.590 --> 02:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
hat because I've been working in the
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
forest carbon offset world for many
 
02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
years I'm going to be doing a
 
02:54:43.469 --> 02:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
presentation on Forest carbon and Forest
 
02:54:46.269 --> 02:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
carbon offset to the Science Tech and
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
energy committee at 9:00 they're going
 
02:54:50.750 --> 02:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
to continue the hearing on the bill they
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
started last week at 10:00 but I'll be
 
02:54:55.710 --> 02:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
presenting to them uh I'm sure you're
 
02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
welcome to attend that but also i' offer
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
to you Mr chair and members of the
 
02:55:01.550 --> 02:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
committee I'd be willing to give you my
 
02:55:04.309 --> 02:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint presentation and in fact come
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
back here and present to you if you wish
 
02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
to learn the details about forc carbon
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
offsets but um there have been
 
02:55:15.070 --> 02:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
speculation about uh this growing in New
 
02:55:17.750 --> 02:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the reality is that as of
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
today there are fewer than 10 Forest
 
02:55:22.229 --> 02:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
land owners in the state of New
 
02:55:25.429 --> 02:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh who have carbon contracts
 
02:55:27.870 --> 02:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
on their Forest land and that amounts to
 
02:55:30.750 --> 02:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
just under 200,000 acres and remember
 
02:55:33.429 --> 02:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has just under 5 million
 
02:55:36.389 --> 02:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
Acres of forest so it's di Minimus it's
 
02:55:39.070 --> 02:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
it's a very small part of the landscape
 
02:55:41.550 --> 02:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
and frankly it is not growing at any
 
02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
large uh Pace the one property that
 
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
brought on this bill the Connecticut
 
02:55:49.870 --> 02:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
Lakes property uh there's
 
02:55:53.710 --> 02:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
146,00 acres under a carbon contract on
 
02:55:56.150 --> 02:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
that property but since that carbon
 
02:55:59.190 --> 02:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
contract was signed in 2014 we've had
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
less than 50,000 Acres added to carbon
 
02:56:04.389 --> 02:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
contracts so it's not growing at a vast
 
02:56:07.389 --> 02:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
space uh pace and it's not expected to
 
02:56:10.510 --> 02:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
frankly because what landowners are paid
 
02:56:12.790 --> 02:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
especially small landowners when I say
 
02:56:15.309 --> 02:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
small I mean Family Force owners like
 
02:56:17.389 --> 02:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
some of the folks who who spoke before
 
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
me uh it doesn't really pay them enough
 
02:56:22.670 --> 02:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
to agree to sign a contract that would
 
02:56:25.030 --> 02:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
be either 40 years in the voluntary
 
02:56:27.630 --> 02:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
carbon Market or a 100 years in that
 
02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
compliance market so uh as somebody
 
02:56:31.550 --> 02:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
who's worked in this for many years I
 
02:56:34.830 --> 02:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
don't expect there to be huge growth in
 
02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh land going into carbon uh offset
 
02:56:41.389 --> 02:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
contracts uh in in the next 20 years
 
02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
unless something changes because the
 
02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
marketplace is simply not paying them
 
02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
enough to encourage a land owner to in
 
02:56:49.710 --> 02:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
fact sign a contract that is very long
 
02:56:52.190 --> 02:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
term and I'll end it there and thank you
 
02:56:56.110 --> 02:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh for your time okay do we have any
 
02:57:00.510 --> 02:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative spilburg
 
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
so um to your point about uh current use
 
02:57:06.670 --> 02:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
just simply being an alternative method
 
02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:07.510 align:start position:0%
just simply being an alternative method
of

02:57:07.510 --> 02:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:57:10.830 --> 02:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
evaluation wasn't the Advent of current
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
use to create a class of prot protection
 
02:57:17.670 --> 02:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
so that conventional assessment
 
02:57:21.070 --> 02:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
standards of highest and best use
 
02:57:24.550 --> 02:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to apply and current use
 
02:57:26.670 --> 02:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
would dictate the valuation yeah it's a
 
02:57:28.750 --> 02:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
good question I look at it slightly
 
02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
differently um because current use does
 
02:57:33.550 --> 02:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
not require you to keep your land in
 
02:57:36.750 --> 02:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
open space forever it is a temporary
 
02:57:39.190 --> 02:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
protection and really the law was set up
 
02:57:42.590 --> 02:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
so that property taxes themselves didn't
 
02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
force you into changing the use to a
 
02:57:46.990 --> 02:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
develop use on your land so that you
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
could afford to keep it as forest and
 
02:57:52.229 --> 02:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
farm and open space land so it really is
 
02:57:54.269 --> 02:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
not a permanent because you can change
 
02:57:56.190 --> 02:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
the use and when you do you pay the
 
02:57:58.229 --> 02:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
change use penalty as other other folks
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
have spoken about but it's a good
 
02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
question Riv and plat I would I would be
 
02:58:05.550 --> 02:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
interested on your PowerPoint just for
 
02:58:07.750 --> 02:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
general education but I don't think we
 
02:58:09.510 --> 02:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
have the time to have a
 
02:58:11.950 --> 02:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
presentation well if you don't mind you
 
02:58:14.269 --> 02:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
could email it to Ways and Means I will
 
02:58:17.229 --> 02:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
do so great thank
 
02:58:19.710 --> 02:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much thank you
 
02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:23.150 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much thank you
very

02:58:23.150 --> 02:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:28.229 --> 02:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
much okay we have two cards here left um
 
02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:33.279 align:start position:0%
next um Patrick hacky from the dncr
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:53.389 align:start position:0%
 
land

02:58:53.389 --> 02:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:54.590 --> 02:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
give you
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
enough thank you Mr chairman for the
 
02:58:59.429 --> 02:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on House Bill
 
02:59:01.710 --> 02:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
1484 um for the record my name is
 
02:59:04.750 --> 02:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
Patrick Hackley I'm the state Forester
 
02:59:06.110 --> 02:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
and director for the New Hampshire
 
02:59:08.269 --> 02:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands I'm just
 
02:59:10.110 --> 02:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
going to read from my testimony and we
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
can we can riff off that if you have any
 
02:59:12.960 --> 02:59:14.670 align:start position:0%
can we can riff off that if you have any
questions

02:59:14.670 --> 02:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:59:19.030 --> 02:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
um so uh division of forest and lands
 
02:59:20.429 --> 02:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
part of the Department of Natural and
 
02:59:22.750 --> 02:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
cultural resources does not have a
 
02:59:24.750 --> 02:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
position on this bill as written but we
 
02:59:27.229 --> 02:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
do have a few concerns so let going to
 
02:59:29.309 --> 02:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit of background uh
 
02:59:30.830 --> 02:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
the division of forest and lands is the
 
02:59:32.790 --> 02:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
state agency charged with the execution
 
02:59:34.910 --> 02:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
of all matters pertaining to forestry
 
02:59:36.670 --> 02:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
Forest management and Forest lands
 
02:59:39.269 --> 02:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
within the jurisdiction of the state one
 
02:59:40.830 --> 02:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
of our key responsibilities is to
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
protect our natural resources for the
 
02:59:44.510 --> 02:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
benefit of the state's citizens visitors
 
02:59:45.630 --> 02:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
and Forest
 
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
industry so it's our agency our division
 
02:59:50.429 --> 02:59:50.439 align:start position:0%
uh that's represented on the current use
 
02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and we also share
 
02:59:55.750 --> 02:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement duties of RSA 79 the timber
 
02:59:57.990 --> 02:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
tax law we share those enforcement
 
03:00:01.550 --> 03:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
duties with Department of Revenue
 
03:00:04.110 --> 03:00:04.120 align:start position:0%
Administration so as has been mentioned
 
03:00:06.269 --> 03:00:06.279 align:start position:0%
by a number of other um individuals who
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
have testified in this bill um this this
 
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh particular proposal is to address the
 
03:00:14.349 --> 03:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
participation of landowners and carbon
 
03:00:15.950 --> 03:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
credit programs that could result in the
 
03:00:18.030 --> 03:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
potential loss of Timber tax revenue due
 
03:00:19.309 --> 03:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
to reduced
 
03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
harvesting this bill would enable towns
 
03:00:22.990 --> 03:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
to exclude Forest landowners from
 
03:00:24.550 --> 03:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
enrolling in the current use program if
 
03:00:26.349 --> 03:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
they sell carbon credits instead of
 
03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
Timber which as we've mentioned is
 
03:00:31.510 --> 03:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
subject to a severance tax under SE RSA
 
03:00:34.150 --> 03:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
79 forc carbon credit programs as
 
03:00:35.550 --> 03:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
Charlie just mentioned are still in the
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
early stages it's not widespread yet it
 
03:00:40.469 --> 03:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
could as representative Kelly mentioned
 
03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
it could become more popular we don't
 
03:00:45.910 --> 03:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
know yet it's really early right now um
 
03:00:47.190 --> 03:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
but there is growing concern
 
03:00:48.429 --> 03:00:48.439 align:start position:0%
particularly in the North country that
 
03:00:50.269 --> 03:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
the timber tax revenue may be diminished
 
03:00:52.429 --> 03:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
over time should an increasing number of
 
03:00:54.150 --> 03:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
land owners particularly those large
 
03:00:56.429 --> 03:00:56.439 align:start position:0%
corporate investment grade landowners
 
03:00:58.389 --> 03:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
choose to generate carbon credits rather
 
03:01:00.229 --> 03:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
than Harvest
 
03:01:02.429 --> 03:01:02.439 align:start position:0%
Timber acknowledging this new Revenue
 
03:01:04.309 --> 03:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
source to land owners and its potential
 
03:01:05.710 --> 03:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
effect on the tax revenues for
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities I want to make the
 
03:01:07.200 --> 03:01:08.510 align:start position:0%
municipalities I want to make the
following

03:01:08.510 --> 03:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
following
 
03:01:10.910 --> 03:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
points the situation in Pittsburgh which
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
you've heard described and which has
 
03:01:13.710 --> 03:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
been in the media for the last8 months
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
mon or so and the state's largest
 
03:01:18.150 --> 03:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
private landowner which uh we've all
 
03:01:19.870 --> 03:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledged has inspired this bill and
 
03:01:22.190 --> 03:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
many other carbon related bills this
 
03:01:25.229 --> 03:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
this session that issue is still
 
03:01:27.429 --> 03:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
unresolved under the terms of the state
 
03:01:29.309 --> 03:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
held conservation easement the landowner
 
03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
must submit their 10-year Forest
 
03:01:32.990 --> 03:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
management plan to our agency to the
 
03:01:36.229 --> 03:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands dncr for
 
03:01:39.389 --> 03:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
review and approval or not while the
 
03:01:40.910 --> 03:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
landowner has indicated that they intend
 
03:01:42.510 --> 03:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
to drop the Harvest to half the volume
 
03:01:44.670 --> 03:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
of previous years in favor of generating
 
03:01:46.910 --> 03:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
carbon credits the State has yet to
 
03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
approve that 10-year management
 
03:01:52.429 --> 03:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
plan relative to the purposes of the
 
03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
easement number two at this stage it's
 
03:01:56.590 --> 03:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
too early to determine how many land
 
03:01:58.469 --> 03:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
owners Statewide will enroll in a carbon
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
credit program and how much this may
 
03:02:03.269 --> 03:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
affect local tax revenues however
 
03:02:05.590 --> 03:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
altering the current use program to
 
03:02:08.030 --> 03:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
address a subset of land owners is not
 
03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
good policy and could result in
 
03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:11.190 align:start position:0%
good policy and could result in
unintended

03:02:11.190 --> 03:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
03:02:13.150 --> 03:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
consequences as has been mentioned by
 
03:02:15.990 --> 03:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
other speakers this
 
03:02:18.349 --> 03:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh third and last Point our
 
03:02:20.830 --> 03:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
current 's tax program as you've all
 
03:02:22.389 --> 03:02:22.399 align:start position:0%
heard is regarded as the Cornerstone of
 
03:02:24.510 --> 03:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
conservation in our state and is a major
 
03:02:26.190 --> 03:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
reason why New Hampshire's landscape is
 
03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
82% forested second only to the state of
 
03:02:32.269 --> 03:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
Maine at 90% excluding land owners from
 
03:02:34.030 --> 03:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
current use who seek to generate
 
03:02:35.630 --> 03:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
alternate Revenue sources from their
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
land May discourage them from keeping
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
forests as forests and seek other uses
 
03:02:43.750 --> 03:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
that would be less beneficial and and uh
 
03:02:46.550 --> 03:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
of broad value to the public interests
 
03:02:48.229 --> 03:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my testimony
 
03:02:49.630 --> 03:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity I'm happy
 
03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
03:02:53.630 --> 03:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you do we have any
 
03:02:58.190 --> 03:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent fellows so I I'm
 
03:03:00.510 --> 03:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh not clear about the fact that they
 
03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
haven't submitted their plan yet have
 
03:03:06.510 --> 03:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
they owned this property for a long time
 
03:03:09.269 --> 03:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
so they've been under current
 
03:03:12.229 --> 03:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
use um or is something changing thank
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative
 
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
fellows um so the current landowner um
 
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
submitted their uh they just submitted
 
03:03:21.630 --> 03:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
their plan two weeks ago actually so
 
03:03:25.110 --> 03:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's under review by my agency and uh
 
03:03:27.910 --> 03:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
other agencies right now um they
 
03:03:30.510 --> 03:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
acquired the land from the previous land
 
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
owner in October of 2022 so they're
 
03:03:35.429 --> 03:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
relatively new they just have owned the
 
03:03:38.229 --> 03:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
land for a little over a year um we
 
03:03:39.710 --> 03:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know about the change in their
 
03:03:42.990 --> 03:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
plans until early summer and it was at
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
that time we we requested them we the
 
03:03:47.349 --> 03:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
the state monitoring the conservation
 
03:03:49.710 --> 03:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
needs been on this property requested
 
03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
that they provide a a revised annual
 
03:03:53.670 --> 03:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
operating plan which is just obviously a
 
03:03:55.950 --> 03:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
one-year plan but also more importantly
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
a 10-year for stewardship plan and so
 
03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
that we just received recently this is a
 
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
fairly large document it's you know it's
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
probably about 50 pages with a lot of
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
charts and maps and stuff so anyway it's
 
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
going to take us a little bit of time
 
03:04:12.510 --> 03:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
but we will be getting back to them in
 
03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
that plan though they they indicate
 
03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
their Harvest levels so that's under
 
03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:19.190 align:start position:0%
their Harvest levels so that's under
review

03:04:19.190 --> 03:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
review
 
03:04:20.990 --> 03:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
now follow
 
03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:25.439 align:start position:0%
up so things like how much they plant to
 
03:04:29.229 --> 03:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
harvest that will have an impact
 
03:04:33.229 --> 03:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
on they're on what what does that why is
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
that important well again as as has been
 
03:04:38.349 --> 03:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
was mentioned the introductory comments
 
03:04:40.990 --> 03:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
by representative Kelly the concern is
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
that this particular land owner um is
 
03:04:46.750 --> 03:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
proposing to to reduce their Harvest uh
 
03:04:50.110 --> 03:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
by 2third actually or actually by half
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
50% and so that has caused a lot of
 
03:04:57.349 --> 03:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
concern about the the impacts to the
 
03:04:58.990 --> 03:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
municipal Timber tax revenues
 
03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
particularly the town of Pittsburgh
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
where most of this land is located but
 
03:05:06.670 --> 03:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
also those jobs related to um the
 
03:05:08.469 --> 03:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
harvesting of the Timber on the property
 
03:05:12.150 --> 03:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
so logging Trucking and then a third
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
value that comes from
 
03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
the the harvest of Timber of course is
 
03:05:18.349 --> 03:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
that wood supply to the local Mills in
 
03:05:20.150 --> 03:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
the North country and elsewhere where
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
this wood is transported so there's some
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
economic Ripple effects that occur with
 
03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
a drop of that magnitude and that's been
 
03:05:30.070 --> 03:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
what's been in the newspaper and of of
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
broad concern for the last several
 
03:05:37.429 --> 03:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
months follow up so tell me what
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
decisions you need to make when you
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
study this whole plan that they've put
 
03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:43.950 align:start position:0%
study this whole plan that they've put
together

03:05:43.950 --> 03:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:05:46.429 --> 03:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
what like what are the options can you
 
03:05:48.190 --> 03:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
are you going to tell them they need to
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
be in a different current used category
 
03:05:54.389 --> 03:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
or what
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
right so I can't get into the details
 
03:06:00.550 --> 03:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
because I've been asked by our
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
department of justice who's also looking
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
at the conservation easement um closely
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
to see how they're going to respond to
 
03:06:11.070 --> 03:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
this proposed drop and harvest but the
 
03:06:14.750 --> 03:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
the conservation easement that um
 
03:06:17.870 --> 03:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
basically um prescribes how this land is
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
to be managed broadly is being looked at
 
03:06:23.469 --> 03:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
very closely it's a very uh
 
03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
multi-layered conservation easement I
 
03:06:26.469 --> 03:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
would say it's probably one of the most
 
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
complicated easements we've we've
 
03:06:30.429 --> 03:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
drafted in the state so we're looking at
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
the easement Provisions just to try to
 
03:06:34.389 --> 03:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
get it answering your question and we're
 
03:06:37.229 --> 03:06:37.239 align:start position:0%
holding that up and saying is the
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
decrease in Harvest um in any way a
 
03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
breach of the easement and that's is it
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
is it is is it in line with the easement
 
03:06:47.349 --> 03:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
or is it not and that's that is our our
 
03:06:52.269 --> 03:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:52.279 --> 03:06:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:06:53.990 --> 03:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:06:58.790 --> 03:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank thank you okay any other
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
questions I think we were out of
 
03:07:03.190 --> 03:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
questions all right but thank you thank
 
03:07:06.070 --> 03:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
you okay the last pink card I have is uh
 
03:07:06.080 --> 03:07:07.630 align:start position:0%
you okay the last pink card I have is uh
Matt

03:07:07.630 --> 03:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
Matt
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
Society

03:07:19.269 --> 03:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:07:23.229 --> 03:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Matt Ley I'm the
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
public policy director for the society
 
03:07:27.269 --> 03:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
for the protection of New Hampshire
 
03:07:30.630 --> 03:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
Forest uh we also oppose this bill for
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
really all the reasons you've already
 
03:07:38.070 --> 03:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
heard so I won't repeat those um I would
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
just want to make one point and um
 
03:07:43.469 --> 03:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
Charlie LEC mentioned the presentation
 
03:07:44.910 --> 03:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
he's going to be giving to the Science
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
and Tech committee um on Monday morning
 
03:07:51.110 --> 03:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know if you are able to tune into
 
03:07:54.150 --> 03:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
that um it's excellent I've heard
 
03:07:57.750 --> 03:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
Charlie present on this on the topic of
 
03:08:00.030 --> 03:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh Force carbon management and Forest
 
03:08:02.710 --> 03:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
carbon markets so these are very
 
03:08:05.150 --> 03:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
complicated issues and I'm actually
 
03:08:09.429 --> 03:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
still learning about them myself but um
 
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
you know it it certainly has relevance
 
03:08:17.190 --> 03:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
to the bill before you um you know again
 
03:08:19.030 --> 03:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
there are so many different facets that
 
03:08:22.349 --> 03:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
go into this um that it's it's you know
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
again we think it's important to to know
 
03:08:27.389 --> 03:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
that but you know but to just respond to
 
03:08:29.950 --> 03:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
the uh question that representative Aly
 
03:08:31.790 --> 03:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
made earlier you know New Hampshire
 
03:08:33.910 --> 03:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
looks far far different today than it
 
03:08:38.550 --> 03:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
did a hundred years ago and um you know
 
03:08:41.190 --> 03:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
the forest Open Fields you know our
 
03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
Landscapes are in part what sell New
 
03:08:46.269 --> 03:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know travel and tourism is
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
such an important part of the economics
 
03:08:52.349 --> 03:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
here that open space is is a part of
 
03:08:54.510 --> 03:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
that and um you know current use has
 
03:08:57.750 --> 03:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
been a key to helping New Hampshire look
 
03:09:00.309 --> 03:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
like it does today but I'll happily take
 
03:09:02.630 --> 03:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you do we have any
 
03:09:04.910 --> 03:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative ORS thank you
 
03:09:06.790 --> 03:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:09:09.950 --> 03:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
question so if this land instead of
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
being forested managed and 50% of the
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
less trees roughly are not going into
 
03:09:17.600 --> 03:09:18.870 align:start position:0%
less trees roughly are not going into
Lumber

03:09:18.870 --> 03:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
Lumber
 
03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
production are they going to have to pay
 
03:09:23.070 --> 03:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
the new owners are they going to have to
 
03:09:28.269 --> 03:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
pay a tax to bring that land out of the
 
03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
conservation uh setting it was in and
 
03:09:33.910 --> 03:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
into this carbon tax setting uh you're
 
03:09:37.229 --> 03:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the property up in
 
03:09:39.630 --> 03:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh yes the huge problem yeah I'm
 
03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
so I actually um I can't answer that
 
03:09:45.269 --> 03:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
question um I don't know what the
 
03:09:50.070 --> 03:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
um you know uh you know what what they
 
03:09:52.990 --> 03:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
would need to do um but like it Patrick
 
03:09:55.349 --> 03:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
said the state's looking at the easen
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
and their and their management plan to
 
03:10:00.150 --> 03:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
determine if it's in line with the
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
easement and Patrick was the speaker
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
Patrick Hackley the state Forester right
 
03:10:09.070 --> 03:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay follow up followup uh would it
 
03:10:11.309 --> 03:10:11.319 align:start position:0%
be possible to bring Patrick back up to
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
Patrick knows the answer does Patrick
 
03:10:19.349 --> 03:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
know the
 
03:10:21.590 --> 03:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
answer do we have any questions from
 
03:10:23.070 --> 03:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
Matt did you have a
 
03:10:25.429 --> 03:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
question I just wanted you to to
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
speculate Suppose there was a sale very
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
similar to the one that we heard about
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
up in Pittsburgh and their plan that
 
03:10:37.990 --> 03:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
they submit is drastically different
 
03:10:42.309 --> 03:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
than the existing plan because they say
 
03:10:43.950 --> 03:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to to we're only going
 
03:10:46.590 --> 03:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
to harvest 10% of the Timber that we
 
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
were doing before can you tell me what
 
03:10:53.070 --> 03:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
your best guess about what would happen
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
next is does the do they lose the
 
03:10:59.990 --> 03:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
conservation do they lose a current use
 
03:11:04.590 --> 03:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:06.950 --> 03:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
happens yeah I'm again I'm not sure I
 
03:11:10.990 --> 03:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
can answer that question I I don't know
 
03:11:17.110 --> 03:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:19.710 --> 03:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to speculate because
 
03:11:21.309 --> 03:11:21.319 align:start position:0%
like I said it's an unresolved matter
 
03:11:24.110 --> 03:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
between the state and the
 
03:11:24.120 --> 03:11:25.990 align:start position:0%
between the state and the
landowner

03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
03:11:28.590 --> 03:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
um so that was a
 
03:11:32.429 --> 03:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
hypothetical similar owner similar piece
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
of land right okay
 
03:11:39.469 --> 03:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
so um conservation
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
easements are are widely applied and
 
03:11:45.950 --> 03:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a tool for Forest land
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
owners and conservation groups to keep
 
03:11:47.760 --> 03:11:48.670 align:start position:0%
owners and conservation groups to keep
land

03:11:48.670 --> 03:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
land
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
forested okay in con and I'm speaking
 
03:11:53.670 --> 03:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
very broadly and we also have a subject
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
matter expert right here in Matt Ley
 
03:11:58.229 --> 03:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
with the forest Society so conservation
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
ements often put um Provisions within
 
03:12:04.030 --> 03:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
them and it's an agreement it runs in
 
03:12:05.710 --> 03:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
perpetuity with the deed and it's
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
agreement between the land owner it's
 
03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
considered the grantour of those
 
03:12:12.910 --> 03:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
development rights and the grantee or
 
03:12:14.349 --> 03:12:14.359 align:start position:0%
the easement
 
03:12:16.830 --> 03:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
holder um so the grantee holds the
 
03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
development rights in in exchange for
 
03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
donating or selling those development
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
rights there's an obligation on the
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
grant tour the land owner to manage that
 
03:12:31.950 --> 03:12:31.960 align:start position:0%
land in a sustainable uh manner um
 
03:12:34.030 --> 03:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
typically that's that's often the the
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
commitment of the land owner is to
 
03:12:38.389 --> 03:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
manage that land responsibly and
 
03:12:40.590 --> 03:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions and and conservation
 
03:12:43.469 --> 03:12:43.479 align:start position:0%
easements are all shapes and sizes and
 
03:12:45.630 --> 03:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
flavors and colors so you can have a lot
 
03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
of different Provisions as long as both
 
03:12:49.229 --> 03:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
parties agree to those
 
03:12:51.950 --> 03:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
Provisions so that's the charge of the
 
03:12:54.670 --> 03:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
easement holder is to ensure that the
 
03:12:56.469 --> 03:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
land owner is complying with the
 
03:12:57.710 --> 03:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
provisions of the easement and if
 
03:13:00.590 --> 03:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're not there are there is also
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions in that easement of how to
 
03:13:04.590 --> 03:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
deal with what is considered a breach of
 
03:13:07.070 --> 03:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
of of the agreement uh basically a
 
03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
violation of those Provisions there's a
 
03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
whole section in the easement that that
 
03:13:13.870 --> 03:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
it that we hold up on the on the
 
03:13:15.510 --> 03:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Lakes properties and there's
 
03:13:17.950 --> 03:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
a provision in almost all easements that
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
give the easement holder the um the
 
03:13:25.750 --> 03:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
process by which they um address that
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:33.870 --> 03:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
helpful so that's where we're at now
 
03:13:35.910 --> 03:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
with the current situation in the in the
 
03:13:37.630 --> 03:13:37.640 align:start position:0%
North country is we reviewing the
 
03:13:39.790 --> 03:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
provisions of the easement in the
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
context of their revised management plan
 
03:13:44.229 --> 03:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
to determine if it's in compliance with
 
03:13:48.229 --> 03:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
easement thank you any other
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing uh yes representative
 
03:13:56.990 --> 03:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
sorry just a clarification is a
 
03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:58.349 align:start position:0%
sorry just a clarification is a
conservation

03:13:58.349 --> 03:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
easement freeing the landowner
 
03:14:07.950 --> 03:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
from current use taxes or from some
 
03:14:10.670 --> 03:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
other because it seems like we started
 
03:14:12.550 --> 03:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
talking about something new with the
 
03:14:15.870 --> 03:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
conservation easement so a at a very
 
03:14:18.269 --> 03:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
basic level a conservation easement is a
 
03:14:20.990 --> 03:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
legal agreement between a land owner
 
03:14:24.070 --> 03:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
private land owner and an entity that's
 
03:14:26.349 --> 03:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
going to hold and enforce the terms of
 
03:14:28.910 --> 03:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
that easement so it could be uh a land
 
03:14:30.510 --> 03:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
trust like the forest Society it could
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
be a a town or city or actually even a
 
03:14:34.990 --> 03:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
state as in the case in the Conneticut
 
03:14:39.870 --> 03:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
lakes and generally um with an easement
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
the land owner will will give up either
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
sell or donate the rights the the
 
03:14:48.190 --> 03:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
development rights you know so they so
 
03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
they they won't you know build a
 
03:14:52.710 --> 03:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
shopping center or you know roads or
 
03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you know in return they will
 
03:14:58.309 --> 03:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
get either paid or they get a tax break
 
03:15:01.389 --> 03:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
um in some way um and the easement hold
 
03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
the The reason an easement holder would
 
03:15:05.870 --> 03:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
do that is to protect those important
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know ecological values you know
 
03:15:11.910 --> 03:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
water quality forestry all that so it's
 
03:15:14.070 --> 03:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
again it's a uh a legal
 
03:15:16.710 --> 03:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
agreement may I have a followup yeah
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
followup so it's a separate instrument
 
03:15:21.710 --> 03:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct a lot of people confuse
 
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
current use with conservation easements
 
03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
not the same so they're still enrolled
 
03:15:28.030 --> 03:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
in current use and the conservation
 
03:15:30.790 --> 03:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
easement is a separate agreement um not
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily related at all
 
03:15:39.110 --> 03:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
so guess another followup so the um
 
03:15:43.870 --> 03:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
town could still be collecting
 
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
money under a current use
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
agreement or perhaps a different tax
 
03:15:55.229 --> 03:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:57.990 --> 03:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
easement uh I mean typically it would be
 
03:16:00.070 --> 03:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know that current use assessment I
 
03:16:01.630 --> 03:16:01.640 align:start position:0%
mean it's possible you know sometimes
 
03:16:03.389 --> 03:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
there may be a payment in Le of taxes
 
03:16:05.910 --> 03:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
Arrangement although that's not a
 
03:16:09.750 --> 03:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
standard okay thank you very much just I
 
03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
mean to picky back on that it's my
 
03:16:11.319 --> 03:16:12.910 align:start position:0%
mean to picky back on that it's my
general

03:16:12.910 --> 03:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
general
 
03:16:15.229 --> 03:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh thought process that that the
 
03:16:18.750 --> 03:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
conservation easement is more to stop
 
03:16:20.429 --> 03:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
development in the future where you can
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
be under current use sell your property
 
03:16:26.189 --> 03:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
they have to pay the the tax but they
 
03:16:27.670 --> 03:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
can develop it whereas a conservation
 
03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
easement would stop development correct
 
03:16:35.309 --> 03:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
thank you all right very good thank
 
03:16:37.790 --> 03:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone that's it for pink
 
03:16:39.950 --> 03:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else uh that has
 
03:16:42.510 --> 03:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
not filled out a pink yes I just had a
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
question if the Dr was going to come up
 
03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
for this bill um I do not have a card
 
03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
for them did you have a question for
 
03:16:52.429 --> 03:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
them I do have a question for there's no
 
03:16:56.510 --> 03:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal no okay may I still ask a
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
question of the
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.199 --> 03:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:16.990 --> 03:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um ke Ming Wong TX policy
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
council with Dr I'd also like to invite
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
uh our assistant director of the
 
03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
municipal and property division to be up
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
here as well to I think this would be
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
more relevant in for thank you so much
 
03:17:31.550 --> 03:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
for being willing to take my question
 
03:17:34.830 --> 03:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:17:39.269 --> 03:17:39.279 align:start position:0%
um I've learned a lot today so forgive
 
03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
my question if it's ignorant um so it
 
03:17:44.830 --> 03:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like the current use Advisory
 
03:17:47.150 --> 03:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
Board falls under the
 
03:17:53.229 --> 03:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
is if people are making money on um you
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
know selling these carbon taxes is that
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
filed in any way with the
 
03:18:08.110 --> 03:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
Dr because it sounds like part of the
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
concern is that we really don't know to
 
03:18:14.510 --> 03:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
what ENT this is happening in the state
 
03:18:17.590 --> 03:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
um so my question is do you have a
 
03:18:20.590 --> 03:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
record of these kinds of
 
03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:22.229 align:start position:0%
record of these kinds of
transactions

03:18:22.229 --> 03:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
03:18:25.349 --> 03:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
either under current the current use or
 
03:18:27.710 --> 03:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
under your role
 
03:18:32.429 --> 03:18:32.439 align:start position:0%
as you know collecting like business
 
03:18:35.950 --> 03:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
taxes or any other Revenue
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
oversight as it relates to current use
 
03:18:41.229 --> 03:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
um no we wouldn't collect that type of
 
03:18:41.239 --> 03:18:43.590 align:start position:0%
um no we wouldn't collect that type of
information

03:18:43.590 --> 03:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of Tax Administration in
 
03:18:48.309 --> 03:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
general I don't believe so but it's
 
03:18:51.070 --> 03:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
certainly something we can look into um
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
if it if or anything would be related to
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
not in relations to business taxes if
 
03:19:03.870 --> 03:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
it's like any other business
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
organization if it's a business
 
03:19:06.630 --> 03:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
organization conducting business
 
03:19:08.389 --> 03:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
activities in New Hampshire yeah it'll
 
03:19:10.990 --> 03:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
they and then within the the income
 
03:19:13.349 --> 03:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
threshold that gross income thr
 
03:19:16.510 --> 03:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
threshold then yet the uh that the
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
person generating that income would be
 
03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
subject to uh business tax
 
03:19:27.389 --> 03:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
so if I can have a followup so if a tree
 
03:19:32.229 --> 03:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
farm engages like in sells carbon tax
 
03:19:34.870 --> 03:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
credits and makes money then they would
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
include that on their income statement
 
03:19:40.389 --> 03:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
but if an individual is doing it then it
 
03:19:42.030 --> 03:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they wouldn't file it cuz
 
03:19:44.309 --> 03:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
because it's not a business
 
03:19:47.550 --> 03:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
tax not necessarily if the business is
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
if the individual is doing it as a
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
business there are uh so proprietorships
 
03:19:54.269 --> 03:19:54.279 align:start position:0%
okay also business uh considered as
 
03:19:55.469 --> 03:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
business organizations that would need
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
to follow a business tax return
 
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay in terms of being able to aggregate
 
03:20:03.229 --> 03:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
that information and get it in a format
 
03:20:05.309 --> 03:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
that would be understandable we probably
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't have something like that that
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
would make more sense in relation to
 
03:20:11.429 --> 03:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
current use in terms of if we knew the
 
03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
number of properties let's say that had
 
03:20:15.110 --> 03:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
current agreements or selling carbon
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
credits that are currently in current
 
03:20:17.750 --> 03:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
use that would be really helpful I
 
03:20:19.710 --> 03:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
assume um and that's not something that
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
that we have at the moment okay thank
 
03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
you all right any anything else any
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
other questions okay thank you very much
 
03:20:29.279 --> 03:20:30.030 align:start position:0%
other questions okay thank you very much
thank

03:20:30.030 --> 03:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
you okay and um I'm assuming there is
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who did not fill out a
 
03:20:37.429 --> 03:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
pink card who wishes to
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
testify seeing none we will close the
 
03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:52.870 --> 03:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
something looks like we are out of
 
03:20:54.790 --> 03:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you though for offering
 
03:20:57.070 --> 03:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
all right I'll close the public hearing
 
03:21:00.110 --> 03:21:00.120 align:start position:0%

Rockingham District 20 down the southern
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
part of the state um I introduced House
 
03:23:31.389 --> 03:23:31.399 align:start position:0%

as a uh a PhD in in uh strategic
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
business but also as a small business
 
03:23:40.229 --> 03:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
owner um House Bill
 
03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
1551 I come across to me from several of
 
03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
my constituents and if you notice it's
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
all the sponsors are actually bipartisan
 
03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
so this is actually bipartisan within
 
03:23:52.189 --> 03:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
the house and a few senders that did not
 
03:23:55.870 --> 03:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
get on here in time bipartisan as well
 
03:23:59.070 --> 03:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
this is in to look at the at the fact
 
03:24:01.229 --> 03:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire after current
 
03:24:04.229 --> 03:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
legislation in Texas and Tennessee um
 
03:24:07.469 --> 03:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of only two states
 
03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
itself and Louisiana are the only two
 
03:24:12.070 --> 03:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
states do not recognize the difference
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
between a C Corp and an S corp now not
 
03:24:18.030 --> 03:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
to go into the the weeds of business but
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
when you create a business and a lot of
 
03:24:21.189 --> 03:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
you business owners yourselves so you've
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
had llc's more than likely and a lot of
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
your small businesses are llc's but you
 
03:24:27.630 --> 03:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
have the option of a partnership you can
 
03:24:31.950 --> 03:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
do an LLP you can or you can do a escort
 
03:24:33.150 --> 03:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
and then if you become a little bit
 
03:24:35.150 --> 03:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
larger and you have a lot of equity then
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
you can become a C Corp now the
 
03:24:38.910 --> 03:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
different why a person would want to
 
03:24:40.710 --> 03:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
become an es Corp and why there's a lot
 
03:24:43.269 --> 03:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
of demand for a lot of your llc's out
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
there to become es corpse becomes really
 
03:24:49.790 --> 03:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
multifaceted reasons one is there's a
 
03:24:52.189 --> 03:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
federal tax benefit from the IRS if you
 
03:24:54.550 --> 03:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
become an escorp to be an escorp you
 
03:24:56.670 --> 03:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
have to have less than 100 employees you
 
03:24:58.590 --> 03:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
have to file an IRS
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
2553 and you have and then to be
 
03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
approved by the IRS once you do that you
 
03:25:05.229 --> 03:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
have to be be able to incorporate
 
03:25:07.710 --> 03:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
yourself with an incorporating entity
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
and you have to be able to have yourself
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
a list of officers the es Corps are very
 
03:25:16.150 --> 03:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
common in family run businesses why is
 
03:25:19.189 --> 03:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
that well because a twofold one you
 
03:25:21.389 --> 03:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
actually as an owner of an escorp you
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
can pay yourself a regular W2 wage
 
03:25:26.710 --> 03:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
meaning that you pay yourself the
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
federal government gets their their um
 
03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
federal income tax and they get their
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
social security and you pay as like a
 
03:25:34.830 --> 03:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
regular employee as any of your other
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
employees do the second reason is you're
 
03:25:40.269 --> 03:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
able to get as a small business equity
 
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
and that way you can put equity in your
 
03:25:44.870 --> 03:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
small business into your family members
 
03:25:46.750 --> 03:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
or employees that have been there for a
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
long time can have a part or portion of
 
03:25:49.439 --> 03:25:50.229 align:start position:0%
long time can have a part or portion of
the

03:25:50.229 --> 03:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:55.309 --> 03:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
business now um where llc's the owner
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
cannot pay himself a regular wage as you
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
know he has to take out what's called a
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
owner's e owner share or owner um where
 
03:26:05.590 --> 03:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
he actually just takes a gross amount of
 
03:26:07.550 --> 03:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
money however much he wants takes out
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
the business and he's taxed on that on
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
his regular taxes es Corps are taxed on
 
03:26:15.189 --> 03:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
regular income taxes too so an escort
 
03:26:17.790 --> 03:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
you is that taxes a corporation and then
 
03:26:20.510 --> 03:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
it gets filed through on the income on
 
03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
the federal on the business goes through
 
03:26:24.910 --> 03:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
the taxes personally of the
 
03:26:27.910 --> 03:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
owner where C Corps are completely a
 
03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
complete separate entity where it's
 
03:26:32.229 --> 03:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
taxed by itself and then the income of
 
03:26:35.590 --> 03:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
the person is completely separate that's
 
03:26:37.389 --> 03:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
a drastic a little bit of difference
 
03:26:39.790 --> 03:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
between them now where this comes into
 
03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
why it's important for escort and C Corp
 
03:26:46.389 --> 03:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
different differentiation is is C Corps
 
03:26:49.070 --> 03:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
as we know are double taxed income comes
 
03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
into the corporation it's taxed then
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
anything that's paid to shareholders or
 
03:26:57.429 --> 03:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
Equity to members is taxed again on
 
03:26:59.309 --> 03:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
their individual income
 
03:27:02.349 --> 03:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
tax escort because it's a small business
 
03:27:06.269 --> 03:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
less than 100 employees is federally is
 
03:27:09.389 --> 03:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
taxes a business and then any
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
distribution to the shareholder within
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
the escorp is not taxed again because
 
03:27:17.630 --> 03:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
that escorp income was already taxed
 
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
when it went through the owner's taxes
 
03:27:22.030 --> 03:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
because it's passed through the owner's
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
taxes federal government gets that and
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the federal government did
 
03:27:28.710 --> 03:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
that and the other 48 of the other
 
03:27:31.590 --> 03:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
states do it but New Hampshire and
 
03:27:34.309 --> 03:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
Louisiana do not recognize an ESC Corp
 
03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
so therefore it is taxed the individual
 
03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
is taxed twice by the state of New
 
03:27:43.389 --> 03:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the business is taxed then if
 
03:27:45.750 --> 03:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
they pay Equity to the equity shers in
 
03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
that small business and goes through
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
their personal income tax it gets taxed
 
03:27:52.630 --> 03:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
again so it's they're actually double
 
03:27:54.990 --> 03:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
tax as an individual now I know this
 
03:27:57.990 --> 03:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
state is big on you know a lot of folks
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
don't want income tax in New Hampshire
 
03:28:01.910 --> 03:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe in income tax but in all
 
03:28:04.550 --> 03:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
honesty in escort you're actually
 
03:28:07.389 --> 03:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
creating an individual income tax
 
03:28:10.269 --> 03:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
because you are double double taxation
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
on a small business
 
03:28:13.750 --> 03:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then taxing that individual that
 
03:28:15.910 --> 03:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
owns it as he passes it through his own
 
03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:17.429 align:start position:0%
owns it as he passes it through his own
business

03:28:17.429 --> 03:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:28:19.950 --> 03:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
again I explain that well any questions
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
feel free
 
03:28:23.950 --> 03:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
thanks questions representative Platt
 
03:28:26.590 --> 03:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
you were speaking at 78 RPM and I'm
 
03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
trying to write it down at 34
 
03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
RPM so I have a question just to follow
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
up explain slowly how the the S
 
03:28:37.910 --> 03:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
corporation is taxed twice in New
 
03:28:41.950 --> 03:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so s corporations the business
 
03:28:43.830 --> 03:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
itself the any of the income the S
 
03:28:46.950 --> 03:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
corporation makes is actually taxed they
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
has a New Hampshire income tax on the
 
03:28:53.469 --> 03:28:53.479 align:start position:0%
profits made by the es Corp then any
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
money that's let's say there's money
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
left over that profit and it gets split
 
03:29:00.590 --> 03:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
up to the equity to equity members in
 
03:29:02.950 --> 03:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
the business or business owners that
 
03:29:07.630 --> 03:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
money gets taxed again as a separate on
 
03:29:10.830 --> 03:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
the because the business and the equity
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
are both passed through the owner's
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
income taxes so it's double
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
taxed in the state New
 
03:29:22.750 --> 03:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow up so the fix I didn't
 
03:29:24.790 --> 03:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
the bill is uh right not right in front
 
03:29:27.309 --> 03:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
of me so the fix is to exclude s Corps
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
from uh inter from interest and
 
03:29:32.630 --> 03:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
dividends or what it's to to mirror what
 
03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements are and the
 
03:29:37.830 --> 03:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
other states as well where it states
 
03:29:40.389 --> 03:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
that a escorp is only taxed on the
 
03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
income the actual Corporation makes the
 
03:29:46.630 --> 03:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
same as what an LLC would be the same as
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
way and because it's passed through a
 
03:29:51.469 --> 03:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
personal income tax so it's to recognize
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
an ESC Corp as a small business and it's
 
03:29:58.229 --> 03:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
not double taxed like a C corporation
 
03:30:00.670 --> 03:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
is representative
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you on I think that you agreed
 
03:30:07.150 --> 03:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
with him that you're talking about the
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax that's correct
 
03:30:12.469 --> 03:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
yes which you guys have just repealed I
 
03:30:14.550 --> 03:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
know I'm trying to put it back but you
 
03:30:17.229 --> 03:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
guys have just repealed
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
it and uh what is your question my
 
03:30:25.429 --> 03:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
on all those other state most of those
 
03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
other states uh pass through the profits
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
of the firm
 
03:30:33.720 --> 03:30:35.229 align:start position:0%
of the firm
to

03:30:35.229 --> 03:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
on to um personal income
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
taxes so it does get taxed but it
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
sounded to me when I read this like
 
03:30:48.510 --> 03:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
you're trying to say that in New
 
03:30:52.269 --> 03:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the any profit from that
 
03:30:54.510 --> 03:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
business is not
 
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
taxed how do you
 
03:31:00.990 --> 03:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
differentiate the escorp profit from the
 
03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
all of the people that share in
 
03:31:08.670 --> 03:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
it so um so um myself owning an escorp I
 
03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
actually was taxed by the state of New
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire twice
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh one is on the profit that the
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
business made you get taxed by state of
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then out that profit
 
03:31:22.750 --> 03:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
if I pay any of it to myself as Equity
 
03:31:24.990 --> 03:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
as part of ownership of the company then
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
that gets that got taxed again so if you
 
03:31:30.590 --> 03:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
make a distribution to yourself that's
 
03:31:34.309 --> 03:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
correct then then that is
 
03:31:37.229 --> 03:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
taxed under the interest in dividends
 
03:31:39.229 --> 03:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
tax that's correct just just like a C
 
03:31:40.750 --> 03:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
corporation correct which at this point
 
03:31:43.469 --> 03:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
is is going away
 
03:31:46.189 --> 03:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
but gradually I believe is so much over
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
so many years or something like that on
 
03:31:51.550 --> 03:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
well the last yeah it's next
 
03:31:55.590 --> 03:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
year so if the interest in dividends tax
 
03:31:58.110 --> 03:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
is not there after next year does this
 
03:32:00.670 --> 03:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
bill make any
 
03:32:03.389 --> 03:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
sense if it would if it's fully
 
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
eliminated then no it would not unless
 
03:32:08.790 --> 03:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
the um at some point if the interest and
 
03:32:11.790 --> 03:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
dividend tax did come back then it would
 
03:32:14.469 --> 03:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
be the there's still no um you're
 
03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
correct if it went fully away and stayed
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
away then no it would not make any
 
03:32:21.910 --> 03:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
difference however if there was ever a
 
03:32:24.389 --> 03:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
if it was tax was ever brought back by
 
03:32:26.349 --> 03:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
Equity or dividends then it would
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
actually um there would need to be the
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
separation again between small business
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:36.429 --> 03:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
again represent
 
03:32:39.269 --> 03:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh would you believe
 
03:32:44.429 --> 03:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
that I agree with representative Aly in
 
03:32:46.830 --> 03:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that I think we should pass
 
03:32:51.389 --> 03:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
this bill in the event that if the indd
 
03:32:54.630 --> 03:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
tax comes back we're basically coupling
 
03:32:56.590 --> 03:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
this to the federal tax return if you
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
will and it'll work the same way so
 
03:33:01.269 --> 03:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
therefore I like both of your ideas
 
03:33:01.279 --> 03:33:04.670 align:start position:0%
therefore I like both of your ideas
thank

03:33:04.670 --> 03:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:33:06.840 --> 03:33:09.590 align:start position:0%
you representative
Aly

03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
Aly
 
03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
alternatively um uh the the people
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
trying to bring back IND which is a very
 
03:33:19.950 --> 03:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
important part of our tax system on
 
03:33:22.710 --> 03:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
could look
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
into on the exemption for the es Corps
 
03:33:30.429 --> 03:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
which would require I think a certain
 
03:33:33.670 --> 03:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
amount of discussion with
 
03:33:37.750 --> 03:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
Dr about that your question was that a
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
would you believe on that's a would you
 
03:33:44.309 --> 03:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
you believe thank you I don't believe in
 
03:33:47.070 --> 03:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
bills for things that haven't happened
 
03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:49.150 align:start position:0%
bills for things that haven't happened
yet

03:33:49.150 --> 03:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative so I I guess this is
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
really Dr
 
03:33:56.950 --> 03:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
but I'll ask the question this way the
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal note on this bill as
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
there should be and uh table
 
03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
two on the the fiscal note which is
 
03:34:09.510 --> 03:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
attached to the
 
03:34:15.469 --> 03:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
bill uh um says that uh the Dr believes
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:20.880 --> 03:34:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
impact

03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
impact
 
03:34:27.910 --> 03:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
2026 2027 and forward that's very
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
significant uh 424,000 million $424
 
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
million uh so um have you looked at that
 
03:34:42.670 --> 03:34:42.680 align:start position:0%
and can you uh what your view of that I
 
03:34:45.189 --> 03:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
have and the question I have and this is
 
03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
where represent of Aly and
 
03:34:50.110 --> 03:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
representative ours ORS um actually
 
03:34:53.429 --> 03:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
correct is that if if it was remain to
 
03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
be able to uh that interest dividends
 
03:34:58.269 --> 03:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
actually remain the same then then this
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
would really be no change to what's
 
03:35:03.550 --> 03:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
already happening um where this would
 
03:35:05.790 --> 03:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
come into effect as if they tried to
 
03:35:08.110 --> 03:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
bring back the interest and dividend tax
 
03:35:12.189 --> 03:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
on the ESC Corp in the future um then it
 
03:35:15.269 --> 03:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
would uh from what I gather out of it
 
03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
how much of this money would actually be
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
brought back
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
in thank you and I think you know rather
 
03:35:24.189 --> 03:35:24.199 align:start position:0%
than pursuing this line of questioning
 
03:35:28.229 --> 03:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
it would be best to get D yes I have had
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
a similar question any other questions
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:35:33.750 --> 03:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative I would hope he would
 
03:35:37.189 --> 03:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
stay microphone I would St hope he would
 
03:35:40.910 --> 03:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
stay to listen to Mr Wong talk to talk
 
03:35:43.429 --> 03:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
about this and then make comments as
 
03:35:47.469 --> 03:35:47.479 align:start position:0%
necessary okay thank you okay um seeing
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
no other questions thank
 
03:36:05.150 --> 03:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
mangang good afternoon uh members of the
 
03:36:09.550 --> 03:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Keen mwell tax
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
policy council with the Dr um I'm here
 
03:36:15.870 --> 03:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
to take any questions on the bill and uh
 
03:36:17.189 --> 03:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you want to ask
 
03:36:18.670 --> 03:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
your question
 
03:36:22.990 --> 03:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
again yeah if you could explain
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh What
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
does that in your estimation will
 
03:36:35.630 --> 03:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
cause this significant loss of income
 
03:36:38.910 --> 03:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
that's shown in your fiscal note right
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
um so essentially as was explained by
 
03:36:45.710 --> 03:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
the uh sponsor um the New Hampshire
 
03:36:49.870 --> 03:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
treats uh es Corps uh taxes the EXs on
 
03:36:52.189 --> 03:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
for business profits tax purposes at the
 
03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
entity level um and then the uh the pass
 
03:36:59.550 --> 03:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
through from the uh income and expense
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
elements that passed through from the es
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
crops to the owners of the ESC crops are
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
not tax uh for New Hampshire purposes
 
03:37:10.870 --> 03:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
what is tax um for New Hampshire and
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
purposes is the distribution uh so if
 
03:37:16.830 --> 03:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
there's any actual distribution from The
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
Entity level to the owners that would
 
03:37:22.030 --> 03:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
potentially be subject to an indd tax
 
03:37:26.750 --> 03:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
but flow throughs is a uh it's a
 
03:37:31.710 --> 03:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
automatic occurrence for uh es corpse um
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
for federal tax purposes um the the es
 
03:37:38.990 --> 03:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
crops are not taxed at the entity level
 
03:37:41.189 --> 03:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
all the flow through elements are then
 
03:37:44.510 --> 03:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
recorded at the owner level and they the
 
03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
owners who if they are individuals and
 
03:37:49.389 --> 03:37:49.399 align:start position:0%
they would file that according the with
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
in uh with their 1040 returns um so this
 
03:37:56.349 --> 03:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal note here that shows this amount
 
03:37:58.510 --> 03:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
loss here does not take into account any
 
03:38:02.110 --> 03:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
kind of indd tax because we do not know
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
whether there's a distribution but this
 
03:38:06.990 --> 03:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
is taking into account the uh the
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that file uh a DP 1220s which
 
03:38:13.030 --> 03:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
is indicating that they are an escorp
 
03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
and then taking that item off the uh the
 
03:38:18.990 --> 03:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
the counting the calculation of the
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
gross business profits for for BPT
 
03:38:24.030 --> 03:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
purposes and that would be the uh the
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
resulting loss because um this bill if
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
reading this bill it does not
 
03:38:30.910 --> 03:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
contemplate any kind of Taxation at the
 
03:38:36.110 --> 03:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
profits so then um is it true then that
 
03:38:45.189 --> 03:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
if if the idd goes away then the fiscal
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
impact is
 
03:38:52.830 --> 03:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
zero no no um if I this this fiscal yeah
 
03:38:55.349 --> 03:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
this fiscal impact here does not take
 
03:38:57.429 --> 03:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
into account any kind of distribution to
 
03:38:59.670 --> 03:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
the indd that would be taxed at the indd
 
03:39:03.189 --> 03:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
level so this is just um yeah with well
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
what is this tax because I thought a
 
03:39:08.030 --> 03:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
distribution is then tax as a dividend
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:16.189 --> 03:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
calculation why would it affect the
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
business I'm confused now why would it
 
03:39:21.070 --> 03:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
affect the business profits tax es crops
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh conducting business activities in New
 
03:39:26.790 --> 03:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will file a business profits
 
03:39:29.269 --> 03:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
tax but they would but my understanding
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
under this bill they would still pay the
 
03:39:32.750 --> 03:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
business profits tax but they wouldn't
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
pay the distribution they would not pay
 
03:39:38.510 --> 03:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax oh they ALS so
 
03:39:39.790 --> 03:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
according to this bill they would not
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
pay the business business profits tax oh
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't pay the business
 
03:39:45.790 --> 03:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
profits tax and they wouldn't pay a
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
distribution the distribution would be a
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
different thing so if the indd is still
 
03:39:53.710 --> 03:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh active any kind of distribution from
 
03:39:57.070 --> 03:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
the escr to the individuals who are New
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents uh would be subject
 
03:40:03.429 --> 03:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
tax okay I guess I I didn't get that
 
03:40:08.309 --> 03:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
from reading the bill initially that the
 
03:40:10.389 --> 03:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
There's No Business profits tax either
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
currently there is currently New
 
03:40:14.429 --> 03:40:14.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire treats s crops and C crops the
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
same so there is business profits tax at
 
03:40:18.990 --> 03:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
the entity level right from my reading
 
03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
of this bill this changes that treatment
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh and then allows the recognition of
 
03:40:26.510 --> 03:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
the flow
 
03:40:30.550 --> 03:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
through and therefore um the es crops at
 
03:40:32.510 --> 03:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
the entity level will not be filing a
 
03:40:35.070 --> 03:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
business profits tax return but the flow
 
03:40:37.510 --> 03:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
through um but doesn't take into account
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
so it's saying that
 
03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
to to follow the federal treatment which
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
is the flowr treatment so if the if the
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
owners are not New
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I guess I don't know how we
 
03:40:54.429 --> 03:40:54.439 align:start position:0%
don't have a personal income tax um and
 
03:40:56.590 --> 03:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
then I guess the uh the owners would
 
03:41:00.550 --> 03:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
then need to file uh New Hampshire 1040
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
or something like that it's it's going
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
to be different from the current Uh
 
03:41:05.439 --> 03:41:07.990 align:start position:0%
to be different from the current Uh
current

03:41:07.990 --> 03:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
practice yes for Pres
 
03:41:13.630 --> 03:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
I went from A to Z on this but yeah the
 
03:41:16.990 --> 03:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
question I have I did too if it it's an
 
03:41:21.389 --> 03:41:21.399 align:start position:0%
escorp I mean if this bill were to pass
 
03:41:21.399 --> 03:41:22.349 align:start position:0%
escorp I mean if this bill were to pass
under

03:41:22.349 --> 03:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:41:22.359 --> 03:41:26.189 align:start position:0%
under
S

03:41:26.189 --> 03:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
Corp does the escort pay a
 
03:41:35.429 --> 03:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
bet yes if um the escort would yeah pay
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
BPT or or bet whichever is
 
03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:41.149 align:start position:0%
BPT or or bet whichever is
applicable

03:41:41.149 --> 03:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
wait a minute if if
 
03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
it if it passes if this passes this
 
03:41:47.870 --> 03:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
passes oh sorry then they're not paying
 
03:41:50.790 --> 03:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
any they're not paying bet not paying
 
03:41:54.149 --> 03:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
BPT well this is a this is an amendment
 
03:41:57.790 --> 03:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
to the BPT statute RSA
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
77-a there's no Amendment to the BET
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
statute um if
 
03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
the if the
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
entity you know falls into the BET
 
03:42:11.910 --> 03:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
filing requirement ments and then
 
03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
therefore that entity would still need
 
03:42:15.630 --> 03:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
to file a bet return un unless that's
 
03:42:19.269 --> 03:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
also a similar Amendment for back okay
 
03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
yes represent Jes I think I understand
 
03:42:24.790 --> 03:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
and I think I and some others were
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
misreading this so so what you're saying
 
03:42:27.760 --> 03:42:29.269 align:start position:0%
misreading this so so what you're saying
is

03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
that I hope you're hearing me all right
 
03:42:34.910 --> 03:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh that the
 
03:42:34.920 --> 03:42:36.990 align:start position:0%
uh that the
bill

03:42:36.990 --> 03:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:42:37.000 --> 03:42:38.510 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
excludes at theend ESC core
 
03:42:46.149 --> 03:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
level all of the flowthrough
 
03:42:49.550 --> 03:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
items uh that are identified through the
 
03:42:49.560 --> 03:42:50.950 align:start position:0%
items uh that are identified through the
federal

03:42:50.950 --> 03:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
federal
 
03:42:54.269 --> 03:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
process uh from a BBT
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
tax and then there's nothing to pick it
 
03:42:59.469 --> 03:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
up at the next level so it's a net loss
 
03:43:01.269 --> 03:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
for the state is that right that is
 
03:43:01.279 --> 03:43:03.510 align:start position:0%
for the state is that right that is
correct

03:43:03.510 --> 03:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:43:07.070 --> 03:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay well then that's a that's a
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
bit of a
 
03:43:12.110 --> 03:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
problem yes represent elberger thank you
 
03:43:14.309 --> 03:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:43:14.319 --> 03:43:16.269 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
question

03:43:16.269 --> 03:43:16.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:43:22.110 --> 03:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
um there would be an impact on the IND
 
03:43:24.309 --> 03:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
tax with if there is an actual
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
distribution there will be an indd tax
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
if the IND tax is still um effective and
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
I assume that you have not done any
 
03:43:35.149 --> 03:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
analysis on the potential impact of that
 
03:43:36.990 --> 03:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
no we have not because we do not know
 
03:43:39.510 --> 03:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
what is the distribution all right thank
 
03:43:45.030 --> 03:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:46.469 --> 03:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
03:43:50.670 --> 03:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
me yeah I know I'm trying to figure out
 
03:43:58.229 --> 03:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
how to phrase this um would there be a
 
03:44:01.950 --> 03:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
way to rewrite this so that it was
 
03:44:06.590 --> 03:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
only uh concerning the indd tax if the
 
03:44:10.030 --> 03:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
IND tax came back I that does doesn't
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
sound to me like a workable proposition
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
in our legislature but that is that
 
03:44:19.710 --> 03:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
waiting for saying if something else
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.640 --> 03:44:26.189 align:start position:0%
 
this

03:44:26.189 --> 03:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:44:29.469 --> 03:44:29.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that's a Dr a Dr
 
03:44:31.149 --> 03:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
question does anyone have any more
 
03:44:34.590 --> 03:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
questions he's the tax policy analist
 
03:44:37.149 --> 03:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
well I mean you you asked him if it was
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
possible to to excl I mean in law we can
 
03:44:45.510 --> 03:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
well if it was possible to do it as a if
 
03:44:49.950 --> 03:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
this happens that happens uh in a law
 
03:44:52.630 --> 03:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure uh some people have
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
tried to do that I don't remember if any
 
03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
of them ever
 
03:45:00.830 --> 03:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
passed um I remember there was one time
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
for BPT that something to do with um I
 
03:45:05.990 --> 03:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
think it was the
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
apportionment um that if the uh if the
 
03:45:12.189 --> 03:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
revenue the state revenue was at a we
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
had trigger bills yes there was
 
03:45:14.590 --> 03:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
something like that I remember there was
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
something done those yes okay representa
 
03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chair uh would it be
 
03:45:23.229 --> 03:45:23.239 align:start position:0%
possible to invite representative Jim
 
03:45:24.429 --> 03:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
back to the table that's what I was
 
03:45:27.389 --> 03:45:27.399 align:start position:0%
about to do but I took your question
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
Summers okay thank
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
you um yes representative
 
03:45:36.950 --> 03:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you um so I guess the I
 
03:45:40.389 --> 03:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
guess the the question is first for two
 
03:45:43.349 --> 03:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
questions one is did you in was your
 
03:45:46.030 --> 03:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
intention to make this bill so that S
 
03:45:48.910 --> 03:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
Corp owners did not pay BPT and did not
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
pay the pass through or was it only the
 
03:45:54.030 --> 03:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
pass through portion you it was only it
 
03:45:55.630 --> 03:45:55.640 align:start position:0%
correct it was it was basically to end
 
03:45:57.550 --> 03:45:57.560 align:start position:0%
up overall you end up treating and
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's what I was going to say as a
 
03:46:00.910 --> 03:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
resolution to treat an es Corp like an
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
LLC so they're still paying taxes on
 
03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
their actual business but anything they
 
03:46:08.070 --> 03:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
distribute to themselves they wouldn't
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
be pay or be fall under the BT and so it
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
follows the same as what the federal
 
03:46:14.349 --> 03:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
government does with es Corps as well
 
03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay I that's what I thought was your
 
03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
intention so I think then but given the
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation from Dr I can see how
 
03:46:22.710 --> 03:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
they interpret it that way we may need
 
03:46:26.550 --> 03:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
to um amend this bill to get to that
 
03:46:32.710 --> 03:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
point Thank you any other questions or
 
03:46:34.750 --> 03:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
clarifications represent Aly you look
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
like you're thinking oh yeah I am trying
 
03:46:43.469 --> 03:46:43.479 align:start position:0%
to to get my head around
 
03:46:45.950 --> 03:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
on how
 
03:46:51.670 --> 03:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
we we could amend the indd bill to
 
03:46:56.349 --> 03:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
exclude what would sound like
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
permissible uh amounts from from the es
 
03:47:03.389 --> 03:47:03.399 align:start position:0%
corpse I UND do I think I understand the
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
problem I'm just not sure what what is
 
03:47:10.910 --> 03:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
considered um because Fair under a
 
03:47:10.920 --> 03:47:12.229 align:start position:0%
considered um because Fair under a
judge's

03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
judge's
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
rule cuz federally um es Corps are
 
03:47:18.830 --> 03:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
treated exactly like LLC Hampshire for
 
03:47:20.910 --> 03:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire um for New Hampshire
 
03:47:25.389 --> 03:47:25.399 align:start position:0%
they're not but um on the federal side
 
03:47:27.790 --> 03:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
they treated exactly like llc's and Es
 
03:47:30.229 --> 03:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
Corps are basically the same and then
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
you have except for ES Corps have the
 
03:47:36.389 --> 03:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
ability to give out to equity where
 
03:47:36.399 --> 03:47:37.910 align:start position:0%
ability to give out to equity where
llc's

03:47:37.910 --> 03:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
llc's
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
don't and and do wages as well for the
 
03:47:43.950 --> 03:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
owners okay thank you I I mean we we
 
03:47:48.590 --> 03:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
will have a work session on this and um
 
03:47:50.269 --> 03:47:50.279 align:start position:0%
certainly if you've got some ideas on
 
03:47:52.269 --> 03:47:52.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that might make that clear we
 
03:47:54.149 --> 03:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
would welcome that
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely all
 
03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
right any other uh any other questions
 
03:47:59.520 --> 03:48:01.349 align:start position:0%
right any other uh any other questions
for

03:48:01.349 --> 03:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
anybody okay seeing none thank you thank
 
03:48:06.149 --> 03:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
you did you have something else you
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to say
 
03:48:08.439 --> 03:48:13.229 align:start position:0%
wanted to say
okay

03:48:13.229 --> 03:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:17.429 --> 03:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just just one more item um
 
03:48:19.389 --> 03:48:19.399 align:start position:0%
it could potentially be a constitutional
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
issue as well when you're carving out
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
the treatment of es cors versus C Corps
 
03:48:26.429 --> 03:48:26.439 align:start position:0%
differently so I just want that to be
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
you maybe it's not so simple
 
03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:34.110 align:start position:0%
you maybe it's not so simple
representative

03:48:34.110 --> 03:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
loople if I'm getting this wrong forgive
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
me um is that part of the issue that if
 
03:48:43.149 --> 03:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to mirror a
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
federal um the Federal Way that this is
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
taxed is it because the the flow through
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
is is based on like a personal income
 
03:48:54.149 --> 03:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
tax and that exists at the federal level
 
03:48:56.030 --> 03:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
and not in our state or am I just
 
03:48:57.870 --> 03:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
completely barking up the
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
rry um it is similar to that as well but
 
03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
also the treatment of um the same class
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
of um I guess same class of property to
 
03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
be taxed similarly so a C Corp versus an
 
03:49:12.399 --> 03:49:13.149 align:start position:0%
be taxed similarly so a C Corp versus an
S

03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
S
 
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
corp um would if you're carving that out
 
03:49:18.429 --> 03:49:18.439 align:start position:0%
differently then it potentially could be
 
03:49:22.349 --> 03:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
treating similar classes of property
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
differently thank you could I I have I
 
03:49:28.950 --> 03:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
have one question um so an es Corp is up
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
to 100
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
employees is my understanding or think
 
03:49:35.550 --> 03:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
shareholders or or I don't think it's
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
employees I believe I'm sorry up I'm
 
03:49:40.950 --> 03:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
sorry up to 100 oh I don't know
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
shareholders I I think the the uh the
 
03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
requirements for an scrop is more on the
 
03:49:47.870 --> 03:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
shareholders side as opposed to an
 
03:49:49.710 --> 03:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
employees number of employees I believe
 
03:49:52.189 --> 03:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
it's the shareholders okay and then how
 
03:49:58.269 --> 03:49:58.279 align:start position:0%
about an LLC Can an LLC have um 100
 
03:50:01.630 --> 03:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
owners um I I do not know the limitation
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
on llc's um okay I'm just trying to
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
think about the differences between an
 
03:50:11.469 --> 03:50:11.479 align:start position:0%
es Corp and an LLC in terms of
 
03:50:17.469 --> 03:50:17.479 align:start position:0%
um so ownership an LLC is uh the way of
 
03:50:20.030 --> 03:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
business is organized like so the state
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
recognizes the LLC as the uh the
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
organization of a of a entity and then
 
03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
the LLC can file either um as a
 
03:50:32.030 --> 03:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
partnership file taxes as a partnership
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
or file it as a corporation and then it
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
files it as a corporation it can upt to
 
03:50:40.950 --> 03:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
file as an escort therefore um make the
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
election to file as an
 
03:50:46.469 --> 03:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
esort and if they file as an escorp this
 
03:50:47.790 --> 03:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
is bringing it to more and then if they
 
03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
follow as NES Corp does that mean now
 
03:50:52.910 --> 03:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
when they do a distribution to the
 
03:50:56.990 --> 03:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
partners the partners have to pay um on
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
the um as a dividend yes so the IND as
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
it is right now it is um
 
03:51:06.710 --> 03:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
for Partnerships
 
03:51:09.830 --> 03:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
llc's and associations that are
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
represented by uh non-transferable
 
03:51:15.910 --> 03:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
shares they they they themselves are
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
subject to the in at the entity level so
 
03:51:21.110 --> 03:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
if they're not represented by
 
03:51:23.950 --> 03:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
transferable shares uh then uh well and
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
then if they're subject to the indd at
 
03:51:27.790 --> 03:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
the entity level then any kind of
 
03:51:31.149 --> 03:51:31.159 align:start position:0%
distribution to the members will not be
 
03:51:33.149 --> 03:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
subject to indd so there won't be a
 
03:51:35.710 --> 03:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
double implication of
 
03:51:40.990 --> 03:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
indd um okay yeah thank you um I think
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
we will take more of this up in the work
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
session I think people are about done um
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
could could I just ask if we could get
 
03:51:51.479 --> 03:51:53.670 align:start position:0%
could could I just ask if we could get
on

03:51:53.670 --> 03:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
whether what in the in the New Hampshire
 
03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
law on if es Corp how how whether
 
03:52:07.710 --> 03:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
there's a limitation on
 
03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
employees in es
 
03:52:14.429 --> 03:52:14.439 align:start position:0%
Corps and the llc's actually but I'm
 
03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
pretty sure there isn't one in
 
03:52:21.550 --> 03:52:21.560 align:start position:0%
llc's um or owners and or owners yeah
 
03:52:26.309 --> 03:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
be yes sure and how you avoid double
 
03:52:34.229 --> 03:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
llc's this I thought what you just said
 
03:52:40.590 --> 03:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
something that oh in terms of the indd
 
03:52:45.670 --> 03:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:45.680 --> 03:52:47.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:52:47.389 --> 03:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:52:49.309 --> 03:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
03:52:49.319 --> 03:52:51.590 align:start position:0%
okay thank
you

03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
yeah all right we'll close the public
 
03:53:00.030 --> 03:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:04.590 --> 03:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
1551 um so next week uh we do not have
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
any committee meetings scheduled I guess
 
03:53:10.110 --> 03:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
we'll find out uh tomorrow evening
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to have a house
 
03:53:13.590 --> 03:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
session that week or not but uh we'll
 
03:53:16.070 --> 03:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
have no committee meetings next week and
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
um I did I don't know if it's thank you
 
03:53:22.349 --> 03:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
it sounded pretty sure that we're having
 
03:53:25.550 --> 03:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
a house issue really okay On
 
03:53:30.630 --> 03:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
th yeah okay um but the following week
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
the we will have a committee meeting on
 
03:53:34.349 --> 03:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
the 30th you should see it in your
 
03:53:38.349 --> 03:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
emails later today the 30th and the 31st
 
03:53:41.229 --> 03:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
and my goal in those two is we will
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
finish all the public hearings of the
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
bills we currently have in committee on
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
the 30th and 31st so then in early
 
03:53:49.790 --> 03:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
February we'll start doing work sessions
 
03:53:52.389 --> 03:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
and exec sessions
 
03:53:52.399 --> 03:53:53.990 align:start position:0%
and exec sessions
so

03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:57.389 --> 03:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
any if there's no other questions thank
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
you all for
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
time
