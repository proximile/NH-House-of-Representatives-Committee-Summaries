00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair appreciate the time
 
00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.550 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair appreciate the time
this

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
morning fellow Representatives I'm here
 
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
to introduce hb20 an act relative to
 
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
transferring statutary Authority from
 
00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to the
 
00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
veteran services when the department of
 
00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran services
 
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
was stood up along with it came a series
 
00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 align:start position:0%
of uh authorities and responsibilities
 
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily the statutes that
 
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
support that what this bill does is it
 
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
transfers the statutory requirement from
 
00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education to the
 
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs
 
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
essentially they're doing the job now
 
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
they've got a team that's already been
 
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
hired and they're you know finding out
 
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
which schools for working out in tuition
 
00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
assistance doing all those things that
 
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
had been under Department of Education
 
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing it what's missing is a
 
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to do that and so
 
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it basically
 
00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
updates the statutes so that what the
 
00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
department it does is in line the
 
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is completely on
 
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
board with this and agrees to it uh as
 
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
is the as is the Department of military
 
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
so it's fairly straightforward subject
 
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
to any questions uh I appreciate your
 
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
support uh thank you representative so
 
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is uh this would Cod y
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
a de facto ongoing situation exactly
 
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
that's been to agreed to by both
 
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 align:start position:0%

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 align:start position:0%

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
program and uh we just wanted to share
 
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
that uh as was representative kraton
 
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 align:start position:0%

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
agreement with the US Department of
 
00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 align:start position:0%
Veterans Affairs uh and accepted the
 
00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the state approving
 
00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
agency uh it's responsible for reviewing
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
and evaluating and approving educational
 
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
and training programs for veterans who
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
educational programs meet Federal
 
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
criteria uh provides assistance to
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
schools and training facilities either
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
that are seeking approval or who already
 
00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 align:start position:0%
approved and must be
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
reapproved um it's a 100% federally
 
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
funded program uh no General funds are
 
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
required uh and as such there's no
 
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact to the the general fund uh
 
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
budget so sumary Department of military
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
Affairs and Veterans Services uh
 
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
supports this bill uh as part of the
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
overarching consolidation of uh veteran
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
services under the department uh and
 
00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for your continued support of
 
00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
service members veterans and their
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
families and with that sir I would uh
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Mr applebe if he has any
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh director of
 
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
educator support and higher ed uh we of
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
course support this as well uh it just
 
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
makes so much more sense for our veteran
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
population to have a One-Stop shop um
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
and additionally they already have
 
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
significant ties to the Federal
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Veterans Affairs that we
 
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
just don't have at the department of EDS
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
so it really made a lot of sense to make
 
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
the move so and exactly as as the
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
Director said it's just codifying what's
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
already in
 
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%

the state veterans advisory committee
 
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support this bill if
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
you'll recall the um the story that I
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
told you when we were here for
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
orientation about how the governor asked
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
us what uh you know if he had a problem
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
with a veteran where do I send him and
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
we said well the answer is probably in
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
this room but we don't we don't have a
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
specific belly button and that
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately led to the standup of the
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
veteran services when that happened
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
about five years ago we kind of realized
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
that there would be pockets of people
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
out there in the government system doing
 
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
things for our veterans that that we

unfortunately they're all grown up now
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
my youngest is 17 so they're kind of
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
like spreading out and uh I am on the
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
school board in my town I didn't mention
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
that and a couple other boards so I do
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
work in the town so um I didn't come
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
fresh out of you know
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
housework to here but um yeah it would
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
be nice if my when my kids were younger
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
if I had done it then then I could had a
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
lot of sign holders but unfortunately
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
they're kind of you you know kind of
 
00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:01.639 align:start position:0%
doing their own thing and that's the
 
00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.710 align:start position:0%
doing their own thing and that's the
thing

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
they they which is kind of good you know
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
they've found their own way I do have

um benefiting he's almost done with his
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
um college degree so that's very
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
interesting to me that he was able to do
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to serve in the Army like
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
the Grassroots type of thing and he
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%

National Guard uh welcome back
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you sir for the
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
record I'm Jim kraton representative
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 30 I'm here to
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.030 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
122

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
122
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
um typically when a National Guard goes
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
out they do a great job they you know
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
they're all through the north coning our
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
search and rescue they're on on the
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
roads they're in towns sometimes they
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
might hit a
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
mailbox sometimes a helicopter might
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
land in a field and knock over a fence
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
that happens uh the rules are today that
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
the National Guard can pay out 500 bucks
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
say here's 500 bucks here's a new
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
mailbox it doesn't have to go through
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
the courts it doesn't have to go through
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
litigation it doesn't have to it's just
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
hey we screwed up we'll pay for your new
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
mailbox um when I talked to National
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
Guard Bureau they said that that $500
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
was established sometime prior to the
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
Civil War or something of that nature it
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
hasn't been updated in a long long time
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill does is it says
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
hey uh you can't get a new bail box for
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
1,000 bucks or for 500 bucks let's up it
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
to a th000 and it gives the uh
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
Department the authority to take care of
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
our citizens as they're going about
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
doing their daily business uh just for
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
context in
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
1983 we used to go through Germany and
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
we had a lieutenant in the back of the
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
formation and he had a bag of 20 or
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
$30,000 in his in his bag and he would
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
pay the Germans as we went through um it
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
was a different world a different time
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
but that's that's the way it's done so
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
this this is just um really taking care
 
00:17:53.789 --> 00:17:53.799 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire citizens that happen to
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
be impacted by the guard in some way
 
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen a lot but it would be
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
nice just to be a able to say here pay
 
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
for the fence and move on so subject to
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
your questions that's that that's what
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
hb22 does and uh I appreciate uh your
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
your support thank
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh I'm
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
aware of uh what the policy was in
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
Europe you described particularly in
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
Germany um I will share just a comment
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh with the Marines in South Korea we uh
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
we go barreling all over the place up
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
and down roads cross fields we set a
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
mountain on fire uh I don't know if we
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
had anybody following uh uh giving M
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
people money I wasn't concerned about
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
that at the time but in retrospect uh uh
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know we did put the fire out that we
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
started I don't I don't know if anybody
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
lost any property but uh uh I'm aware of
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
of the situation in training where
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's collateral damage and
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh I I am glad that we have something in
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
place to uh address that questions for
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor uh yes uh Madam clerk
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chairman so just to
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
clarify would this bill raise that limit
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
to $1,000 yes ma'am it it takes it from
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
500 to 1,000 all right um followup good
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
question and followup
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
so does the bill set some regulations
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
around um reimbursement for the the
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
original value of the property item I'm
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
just wondering you know someone could
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
have a damaged mailbox but it's one of
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
those plastic ones you can pick up from
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
Home Depot and then they may come to you
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
and say my mailbox was damaged I would
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
like a nice Granite one yes ma'am um
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
short answer is this bill does not okay
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is change 500 to
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
1,000 okay the rules regulations
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
associated with fair value and all that
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
are already existent okay and this just
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
says hey 500 isn't enough let's give the
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
department a th000 all right thank you
 
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
department a th000 all right thank you
for

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
clarifying representative is there an
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
appeal process if a if there's a $10,000
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
mailbox or what
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
whatever uh U and the the homeowner that
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
has the damage does thinks that the
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
damage incurred was greater than $1,000
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
is is it a repeal process yeah yes sir
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
there is um and that's already existent
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
and so if it if the claim goes above
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
today $500 then it goes through a
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
totally separate process which is a
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
legal process for claims and
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement thank thank you other
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Rollins yes
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if I
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
remember correctly there was an incident
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
with National Guard training I believe
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
in a field a snowmobile that came around
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
a corner too fast clipped one of the
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
helicopters and he suing does that
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
pertain to this or is that is this
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuit something separate than what
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
we're looking no this is completely
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
separate so that that would be a lawsuit
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
through the legal program this is an
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
administrative action which is just a
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
claim that goes and says hey you guys
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
broke my mailbox if if the snowm broke
 
00:21:15.269 --> 00:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
the helicopter then that's the other way
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
around and that's completely
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
different thank you good
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
question other
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
questions sing none thank you uh to the
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor uh we have in the house
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
again uh she was here last week Deputy
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
agitant General Nicole deset Bixler
 
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:39.470 align:start position:0%
agitant General Nicole deset Bixler
welcome

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
back thank you Mr chairman and members
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee um just as
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative representative kraton
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
just uh outlined this really just lifts
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the limit the limit was placed at 500 in
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
1981 under RSA 110b 73 so that was a
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
long time ago so what we're trying to do
 
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
is keep up with inflationary costs um
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
and also we are cleaning up the language
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
which is very
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
minor which refers to the Department of
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
agitant general which has changed as of
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
2019 to the Department of military
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services so really
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
what we're doing by raising the limit to
 
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
a th000 is we could have payments out in
 
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
approximately 2 weeks for these small
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
claims whereas the board of claims
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
appeal and all of that the whole legal
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
process that comes with the board of
 
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
claims process if it's over $1,000 can
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
take months so that's the difference we
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
can pay it out quickly for a small claim
 
00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:47.559 align:start position:0%
I gave a couple of examples in my
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
written testimony um but that's that's
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
really the gist of it thank you for
 
00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak and do you have any
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent mental bomb uh
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh you mentioned
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
Britain testimony would you be able to
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
provide that to us yes I I did already
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
should I make copies and send again or
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that I I don't have a
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
copy of the written testimony did you
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
submit it via uh the via email okay
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
about a week ago okay I'm sure but I can
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
provide it again and I I'll email all
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee if you'd
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
like sir well we don't ask you to do
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
that twice uh we'll look for that but if
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
as a back I do have a copy of it right
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
now but it's just one copy would you
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
like it sir the clerk always likes to
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
file a hard copy okay and um and we will
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh we will find uh we we'll check the
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
email so that everybody can review that
 
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
um sir I can provide that right now uh
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
if you if you didn't mind I don't mind
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
sir we our clerk keeps a file and again
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
one hard copy is always good of course
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
we have the electronic testimony as well
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that uh any other
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
bataki um thank you Mr chair I just want
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
to understand more about this because
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
we're talking about raising money from
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
$500 to
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
$1,000 so who's going to pay this money
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
sir that would come out of the budget
 
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:26.919 align:start position:0%
for the Department of military Affairs
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
and veteran services so we feel that we
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
could absorb this in our budget this
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
happens very rarely when I talk to our
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget officer who's been in that
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
position for 25 years she said only two
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
times this would have applied in that
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
period of time and the and the total
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
would have only been a thousand but it
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
was more than in those two incidents
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
were more than the $500 so we had to go
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
through the board of claims appeals um
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
and appeals process
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
M followup quick certainly uh followup
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
so we are not making this money from our
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
budget from state budget money is coming
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
from the federal
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
government no sir it's not coming from
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's coming from the Department of
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and and veteran
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
budget yes as I understand your good
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
question about where the money comes
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
from the uh
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
it it's from the guard's budget and and
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
the the total guard budget uh is a
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
function of both uh State support and
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
federal support um is that fair to say
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
so as yes sir so we have we have a state
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
budget and this would come out of our
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
state budget this is not 100% federally
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursable this this comes out of our
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
state budget and we feel that we could
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
absorb that cost uh and that's why the
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is there too that you know I
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
I when I went over the fiscal note this
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
is before I've been in this position for
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
about two weeks and three days and five
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
hours I'm just kidding but uh the fiscal
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
note uh was done prior was done uh in
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
2024 and it says that for fiscal years
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
2025 through
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
2028 um the fiscal impact would be less
 
00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:25.029 align:start position:0%
2028 um the fiscal impact would be less
than

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
$10,000 um I think it would be even less
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
than that I don't think that very many
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
claims would fall under the ,000 limit
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
um however if it did and then that's
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
small enough that we feel that we could
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
absorb that with our state
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
budget does the guard have a line item
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
for this for this uh for this funding or
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
is it would it come from a general fund
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
type situation sir I believe it would
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
come from the general fund but I can
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
check with my budgetary
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
office okay thank you I mean the the
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
thought then would be if it was a line
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
item and it was not and there was no
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
damage done would would the line item
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
roll over or or we would request it the
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
next for the next bial budget yes sir we
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
would but I honestly sir I don't know if
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
we have a line item for this but I can
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
check with my budget
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
officer okay if that wasn't too much of
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
a it seems that did come up as as a fair
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
question if uh if if someone could shoot
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
yes sir I'll I'll get back with you on
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
that get back to you and the members of
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
the committee would be just a little bit
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
smarter that's why we have these
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
hearings sure absolutely uh rup Manion
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I think just to piggyback on that
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
if it goes through the claims process
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
you're still paying that anyway right so
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
if it goes beyond the $500 currently
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
right now you're still out of you're
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
still paying the same money this just
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
allows for an administrative action to
 
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
be a lot quicker correct yes sir all
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you other
 
00:27:57.389 --> 00:27:57.399 align:start position:0%

27y year resident of the town of hookit
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh the
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
svac supports this bill uh periodically
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
things need an update you know I I I
 
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
have a a saying I use a lot with my
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
friends when they discover something
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
that um everybody else has been doing
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
for like a decade or so you know like
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
they say hey I just discovered I can pay
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
all my bills online well welcome to the
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
20th century well that's kind of where
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
we are here this thing hasn't been this
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing hasn't been updated since the
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
before the 20th century so it's time to
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
uh to realize that things cost more and
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
and and this is a a small price to pay
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
for those people that might fall within
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
that $500 to $1,000 window that to not
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to go through the claims process so
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
we support this legislation that's all I
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%

have a slow clock and a fast clock and
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
the uh as I see the fast clock which is
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
when I'm going by it's uh approaching
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
1010 and so uh with that uh I will uh

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32 I am here introducing
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 64 um the need for this bill
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
was brought to my attention by the
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
um this is a very important move that we
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
can make to help our active duty and
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
their family um feel welcome comfortable
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
and help them Thrive within our state
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
and helping them establish businesses
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
and giving them the same preferences
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
that we here to have given to active
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
duty or or veterans is going to help
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
them establish and hopefully grow their
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
businesses and stay in our state when
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
their commitment to the military is
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
finished as well so I'm going to let the
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense explain to you the
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
minutia of the bill and why they feel
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's necessary but I hope you will give
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
it your consideration and support and um
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions you want but I I
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
think that they would be better suited
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
them thank you represent I do want to
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
throw one at you as the prime sponsor
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
the uh description of the ACT uh the the
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
expression hiring preference preference
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
is there uh and I I think we all
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
understand what that generally what that
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
means but when there is a a preference
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
and when military folks get an advantage
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh or preference that's the word here uh
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
that sometimes can be perceived as at
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
the expense of of someone else uh so
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
that's a question that I think uh is
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
likely on the minds of some of the folks
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
watching at home or or some of the
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee members and we can uh ask
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
about that to some of the subsequence uh
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
testifiers but uh do you have any
 
00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
concern that uh preferential treatment
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
for veterans could be um uh unfair to
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
other people I I don't know if that's an
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
issue but but uh in terms of preferences
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
that that's something that uh I think
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
we'd like you to address sure I would be
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
happy to I'll give you my my personal uh
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
take on that
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
um preferences when looked at in General
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
would mean that someone's treated
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
differently or better than someone else
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
for no
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
reason the people that we talking about
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
extending a preference to are people
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
that that we owe a debt to we we can't
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
pay um we don't there's not enough money
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
to pay for someone's lost love life
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
fortunes that they sacrific by serving
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
in the military family members um move
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
around the world in the country with
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
their loved ones all in defense of our
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
Liberty and
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
freedom I feel that a small gesture of
 
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
op giving them an opportunity to have a
 
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
job or a business within our state is is
 
00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
a is a thank you that we can extend to
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
them that doesn't cost us anything and
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
as far as the ability to obtain that
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
preference um we have a volunteer
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
military and anyone is available to join
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
it and risk their lives and their
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
fortunes and thereby gain that
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
preference for themselves as well so
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's not something that people are given
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
by Birthright or by their nationality or
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
color of their skin or religion they
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
have to earn it and they have to put
 
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
something on the line to get that
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
preference so I would say that that
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be my response to that thank you
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
for that any other questions for the
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor reps of mandle bomb thank
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so this might be getting
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
a bit technical but when it comes to
 
00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
preferences for disabled veterans and
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
Military spouses when it comes to state
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
purchases where would that preference
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
for those people fall in relation to the
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
cost of those goods or services I I
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
would I'll I'll I'll haard to guess but
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
please take what they say the dod says
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
above what I say and if it contradicts
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
they're right and I'm wrong um I would
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
say that we would not take a more
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
expensive um contract over a more
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
efficient one simply because the person
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
has that preference I think looking at
 
00:38:59.309 --> 00:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
it it would be all things being equal
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
the preference should go to the veteran
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
spouse or the veteran versus well the
 
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
state will have to spend an extra
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
million but that's a veteran no all
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative plan thank
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair just to clarify this bill
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't touch on uh purchases and
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
preference of who who gets allocated um
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
a contract to bid on something this is
 
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.790 align:start position:0%
a contract to bid on something this is
simply

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
expanding already existing law to
 
00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
include military spouses for hiring of
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
positions where they would go to work
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct the current bidding
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
process is open to everyone and no one
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
would get preference as far as who's
 
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to bid on on things thank
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
questions Cena thank you to the prime

Military spouses the department supports
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation uh the bill expands the
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
definitions for Veterans for the
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
purposes of veterans hiring uh
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
employment preferences to include the
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
veteran spouse and active duty service
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
members as as well um of the 85,000 or
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
so veterans in the state
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh most are doing very well they make up
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
about 6% of the population uh well over
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
the majority are employed approximately
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
70% are making $50,000 or more most own
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
houses uh and are doing well but there
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
are some areas that they're economically
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
challenged uh and we feel this would
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
positively impact their households
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
veterans unemployment rates are are
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
slightly lower
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh than the state's average uh veterans
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
earn about 7% less than the New
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire median income uh approximately
 
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
5% of veterans in the State live in
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
poverty uh and about any given time
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
across the state about 150 veterans may
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
be homeless uh this B Bill helps set
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
conditions for at least achieving A
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
Little More Level Playing Field uh both
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%

defense's efforts through the defense
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
State leaon effort to identify and
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
address the most pressing needs of this
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
is one towards military spouse
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
employment and economic opportunities
 
00:42:15.069 --> 00:42:15.079 align:start position:0%
and I believe you have written testimony
 
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
from the defense State liaison and
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe some uh testimony later
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
this morning on on that effort um and in
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
the event that the spouse is female and
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
the secondary beneficiary of the outcome
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh includes addressing the gender gap
 
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
recent Studies have shown that in New
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we are currently listed as
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
the the second highest gender gap in the
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
nation and this would contribute towards
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
addressing that situation uh this effort
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
also reinforces the New Hampshire
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
veteran friendly business Network's
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
efforts as we work with them to
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
encourage their uh recruiting and
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
retention of veterans across the state
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
it supports the New Hampshire Department
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and Veteran Services
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
livefree chws New Hampshire efforts
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
where we reach out across the globe to
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
service members who are selecting to
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
return to the state uh and it provides
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned or implied earlier uh a
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
little more than just to thank you for
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
your service but provide some actionable
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
measures uh that contribute to service
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
members and their spouses well-being
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
there is some language uh in the LSR
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
that we would like to work with the
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor on lines 16 through 19 that
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
reflect uh a position of for the agitant
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
general perhaps to to do some uh
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
oversight and management so we'd like to
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
work with the sponsors there to to
 
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
address the specifics on that we're not
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
currently maned to address that but
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely welcome and and would look
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the sponsors to
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
address that going forward so in in
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
summary uh the sponsor's intent
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
increases the likelihood of Financial
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
Security for our transitioning service
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
members uh and their veterans and their
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
families uh and the bill sets the
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
conditions for improving their
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
well-being and at this point subject to
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have uh that
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
concludes Our Testimony thank you Mr
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
Fraser so I'm hearing that there's a
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
desire for some language changes and
 
00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and that would be coming
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
from you or who who is going to suggest
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
the language sir yes the uh the the
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
department would work with the sponsor
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
to share some recommended language with
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
respect to uh the the agitant general
 
00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
and and uh perhaps uh my position to be
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
able to do oversight of this program so
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh We've shared some initial thoughts
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor but we look forward to
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
more detailed
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
discussions okay uh and I see the prime
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor repent Roy is still here so this
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
measure is uh scheduled to be exact of
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
course we can always uh push that back
 
00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh represent Roy if I could ask
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
you uh about the um amending language
 
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
that Mr Fraser spoke about when might
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
that be uh available for us to look at
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
and and take or get it to OS first and
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
then look then I'm not I'm not entirely
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
sure that it's necessary maybe um it I
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
think the part's talking about is
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
assigns a role of oversight to the adant
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
General's office and do you not report
 
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
to the adant general I do so I would
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
think that that the adant general has
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to defer whoever he wants or
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
assign whoever he wants to to fulfill
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
that role I don't think it mandates he
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
personally do it um so I'm hearing that
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh the language concerns that Mr Fraser
 
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
flagged are concerns that could be uh
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
addressed kind of through like a rules
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
situation implementation on the
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
implementation level through local
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
rules uh and would not necessitate a
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
change in the language of of
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
hp64 is Sir
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh with the with an
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
assessment uh currently ongoing uh while
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
I think that would address the the
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
specific language in in 16 through1 19
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to the agitant general uh
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
the department is not currently manned
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
to actually execute that we're the
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
agitant general to delegate that down
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
and so a little more discussion in terms
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
of the specific requirements and
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
processing procedures to make this
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
happen I'm sure it's something we could
 
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.630 align:start position:0%
happen I'm sure it's something we could
work

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
through okay uh I'm going to just
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
request the prime sponsor uh confirm
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
with me uh today's a Friday like uh
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
early next week Monday or Tuesday at the
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
latest yeah uh if if there is a need for
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
us to uh work on some amending language
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
or not so that we can um if there is a
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
need for some language adjustment that
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
I'll get it done and I'll send it to you
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
okay great and then um we'll keep this
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled for exact next Friday unless
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh this should be no problem getting it
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
done by then okay uh any qu yes uh
 
00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
representative Bennett for Mr
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
Fraser yes I just have a question um
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
could you give a scenario as to how this
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
would work and who this would help like
 
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:15.870 align:start position:0%
would work and who this would help like
in

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
action no absolutely I I think I would
 
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
associate my initial thoughts with the
 
00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor earlier when he talked
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
about preferences uh with respect to to
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
Veterans and their spouses in terms of
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
the sacrifices that they have made in
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the country uh in their
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
service and so um if you look at some of
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
the economic disadvantages that I
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
described earlier if you might imagine
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
one of those persons who's perhaps moved
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
every two to three years uh has had to
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh upend their careers and then start
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
over uh in a new location uh just the
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to from a a granite
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
State perspective share that uh that we
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
have a preference for military spouses
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
and active duty service members is a
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
significant help I think uh as one looks
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
at a service member uh who is activated
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
and going to deploy uh conduct
 
00:48:12.839 --> 00:48:13.990 align:start position:0%
and going to deploy uh conduct
operations

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
overseas uh to enable them to help focus
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
on their mission uh it is a significant
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
help having done multiple operations
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
overseas not to have to worry about my
 
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
spouse and my family members but knowing
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
that they have the opportunity to be
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
able to continue their careers uh allows
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
mission I I was just kind of like are
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
you saying they're applying for a job
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
followup followup yes sure go ahead um
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
are you saying that they're applying for
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
a job and we're just saying we take one
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
over the other or are you just saying
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking specifically for service
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
members for this position or something
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
again I think I would associate myself
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor language where he
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
described it's it's not a a single uh
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
point of discussion with respect to
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's a hiring action or whether
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
it's a procurement Services uh that you
 
00:49:15.549 --> 00:49:15.559 align:start position:0%
take this into consideration amongst all
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
things uh and then all things being
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
equal that the the veteran the service
 
00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:20.839 align:start position:0%
member the spouse would have a
 
00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
competitive advantage or at least for
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
consideration he said it much more
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
eloquently than I did though
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and it's always
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
helpful to have an example uh to help us
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
visualize the implementation of what
 
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about yes I think the
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor addressed the my question
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
and our question about the preference
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
issue uh he addressed that very well I I
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
thought other
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
questions uh R melbon thank you Mr
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
chairman so um Mr Fraser you mentioned
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
that there are additional measures to
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
close the gender gap could you give one
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
or two examples of what that might mean
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
I I think my intent was to share that
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
this would uh contribute to closing the
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
the gender gap all right thank
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative Lloyd
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question um are there other
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
states that are already enacting this
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
type of
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
legislation or or legislative change
 
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
rather I think I would have to get you
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh do a little bit of research and share
 
00:50:26.789 --> 00:50:26.799 align:start position:0%
that back with you
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's another great question we always
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
are interested in what other states are
 
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
doing um so if if there is anything
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
handy uh that you might be able to share
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
that that's a that's a very good
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
question other questions
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative Buddha Taki I'm working
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
on it representative thanks uh Mr chair
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
this is not a question but just a you
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
know remark um as you as this body knows
 
00:50:54.069 --> 00:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
that I came here as Refugee and when I
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
drive you know in Manchester I see a lot
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
of veterans uh in the street uh and I
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
also heard that you know 5% of our
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
veterans they are under poverty level
 
00:51:05.789 --> 00:51:05.799 align:start position:0%
and also uh you know some of them are
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
homeless so I think I feel very bad when
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
I see uh these conditions um and also I
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
think we can do much more better than
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
what we're doing at this time to
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
Veterans families thank you thank you
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
for that comment and that's a comment
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
that would be particularly useful uh in
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
executive session to maybe uh develop
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%

every 2 to 3 years these rapid rates of

which in turn have long-term

demographic military spouses are

unemployed at a rate of 21% a rate that
 
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
is significantly higher than their
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
civilian counterparts but like their

when looking at ways to reduce the

Bill 64 also has the opportunity to not
 
00:55:58.109 --> 00:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
only benefit our military families but
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
also the employers actively looking to
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
recruit talent for some employers
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
providing a military spouse preference
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
will assist with hiring goals enhance
 
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
Talent amongst their Workforce and
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
support the local military Community
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
military spouse hiring preference would
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
be a well-deserved recognition of the
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
sacrifices made by military families as
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
well as a sound economic investment in
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Workforce when military
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
spouses are able to secure stable and
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
fulfilling employment they are more
 
00:56:29.309 --> 00:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
likely to contribute to their
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
communities this in turn can lead to
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
increased economic growth reduced
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%

so I let's Circle back to uh
 
00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd's question that I
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
already alluded to about uh other states
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
doing this type of thing do you have any
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
knowledge from there are there are a few
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
a handful um that have implemented this
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
particular policy priority Maryland uh
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
was actually the most recent to
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
implement it and I know a few of my
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues are actually doing the same
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
thing uh as I am testifying in
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
legislatures across the country uh in
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
support of of the policy priority but at
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
at this present time there are four or
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
five and I can get the list uh of those
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
states to you Mr chairman after this
 
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
meeting are you aware of any hiccups or
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
issues that Maryland or these other
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
states have had uh implementing this
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
type of initiative there haven't been uh
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
thus far but I can ask my colleagues who
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
have have worked in those individual
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
states right now it's not a a policy
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
priority that's on the dedicated list of
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
10 from the defense department um it's a
 
00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
pilot uh at the moment uh and really to
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
work uh on any way we can to reduce the
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate for for military
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%

and it was something about
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
employment yep so in 2021 there was a
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Defense survey sent to
 
00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
military families um and it it surveys
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
their experience in the military uh with
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
PCS moves access to education employment

respondents um those active duty
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
military spouses identifi having a
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
problem finding uh meaningful employment
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
when they relocate to their next Duty
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
welcome uh representative
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
Bennett thank you Mr chairman um I just
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
had a question about the
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
21% um employment uh I think you said
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
spouse military spouse unemployment
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
Minister okay thank you um is that
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
including people that maybe they don't
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
want to have employment or is that just
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
based on people who want employment and
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
can't find it yeah that that figure is
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
based solely on Military spouses who
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
have are seeking employment and can't
 
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
find it so that's not including those
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
who have chosen to um stay home to take
 
01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:18.039 align:start position:0%
care of family or those who have just
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
given up their job search or have given
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
up their professional license because
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
it's too burdensome and cumbersome to
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
train transfer their professional
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
other representative plant thank you Mr

just wondering this we're talking when
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
we talk public employment we're talking
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
about uh State Employment within the
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire also probably
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
Municipal employment for municipalities
 
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
um does this type of preference uh
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
already exists for federal employment at
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
the federal level for federal positions
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
there was was a hiring uh preference
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
executive order from the previous
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
president um but it was an executive
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
order um so with the transfer of power
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
that uh recently happened uh that
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
place that's uh just a moment R some
 
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hemingway uh very interesting question
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
and your answer was it was in a federal
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
exec presidential executive order
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
correct in this area and so natur we're
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about executive orders is
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
is this an executive order that's still
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
in effect it it's not it it was an
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
executive order by uh former President
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
Biden for federal civilians uh so
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
federal employment so military spouses
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
would have preference for federal
 
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.390 align:start position:0%
would have preference for federal
civilian

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
civilian
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
positions but it with the transfer of
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
power that's it's not a okay and so that
 
01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:53.039 align:start position:0%
that executive order is not in effect at
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
this time in the federal level to my
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that good good
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hemingway thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so a lot of
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
the stats that I see is is uh relative
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
to active duty pcsing and everything
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
like that I I understand the the process
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
on that having uh been in the my father
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
was in the Air Force and and I served 10
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
years on active duty and traveled um so
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
I understand the the process and and the
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh the partner the spouse be it male or
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
female that has an issue getting
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
employment so does this cover the
 
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
National Guard I know veteran is a
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
veteran uh but a lot of this language is
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
related to active duty so the bill as
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
written defines a military spouse as uh
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
an individual that is married to an
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
active duty service member and holds a
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
valid deer card um so if you wanted to
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
include those members those military
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
spouses of the garden reserve the
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
definition of military spouse in statute
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
would also have to be
 
01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:06.200 align:start position:0%
amended as written it would cover active
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
duty Guardsmen so those AGR uh members
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
um but but as written it's it's active
 
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
spouses other questions and just to add
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
on to that of which there are just under
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
500 uh living in New Hampshire
 
01:03:26.319 --> 01:03:28.109 align:start position:0%
500 uh living in New Hampshire
active

01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
active
 
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
duty that's a good statistic thank you
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
for that one anything
 
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
else thank you Miss wette you're for
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
your service and for coming in here
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
today uh Mr Kevin Grady is still in the
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
house uh he I know he has a a uh
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
military spouse because he in this very
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
committee room he and the spouse I
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
believe testified on a different measure
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
in a different committee so uh Mr grd's
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
asked for 3 minutes welcome back
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
I'll get it done a lot faster than that
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh for the record again my
 
01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:02.839 align:start position:0%
name is Kevin Grady 25y year Air Force
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
veteran and a 20 uh seven-year resident
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
of the town of hookit New Hampshire the
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
state veteran advisory committee
 
01:04:12.029 --> 01:04:12.039 align:start position:0%
supports this legislation it it fits
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
right in with our our Mantra that when
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
one of us serves the whole family serves
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh for perspective as the chairman
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I moved 10 times in a
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
25-year career including three overseas
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
tours two to the the Far East and one to
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
Germany and my wife had to reinvent
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
herself every single different place
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
that we went so something like this is I
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
in our view is a relatively small price
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
to pay especially for those of us who
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
know the sacrifices that our military
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
spouses make close aboard that's really
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
all I wanted to tell
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Grady
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thanks again
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
Danielle Albert is here welcome Danielle
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Department of Labor um she's
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
asked for less than five minutes it does
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
not say if whether she supports or
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
opposes the
 
01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
measure um uh
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning thank you for
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
having me I'm Danielle Albert I'm the
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um And to clarify
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on the bill um
 
01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
we are here to relay that we have
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed the language in particular as
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
it relates to the amendments to RSA 275g
 
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
which fall underneath the labor statutes
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
um and are here to offer just a few
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
points of technical consideration uh
 
01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
based on the review of that language um
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
I will start um and I'll I'll use the
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
lines and the numbers so looking at page
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
two uh line 25 under um section 4 there
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
is a newly added definition of military
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
spouse and it's pointing towards the
 
01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:57.799 align:start position:0%
same meaning is in RSA
 
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
2154 when we look at RSA 2154 it's
 
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
actually defining um service connected
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
injuries so we're not certain that
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
that's the intended definition it
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to Define military spouse
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
so as a technical Point um if if that is
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
not the intended uh statutory reference
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
for defining a military spouse we would
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
highlight that um and the only other
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
technical point that we would um note is
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
that on page three line three as it
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
relates to verification of eligibility
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
under 275 G3 um we understand the uh
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
amendment to that provision to uh
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
specify that a private employer may
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
require a veteran um to now uh provide
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
any qualifying document under RSA 2150
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
there's a large enumerated list under
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
2150 and we understand um that reference
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
we would simply note that the language
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
in that provision um remains that the
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
employer may ask the veteran and it
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't encompass or include the
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
military spouse or active duty members
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
that have been added by definition to
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
the statutory provision um so our
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
reading of that and our understanding of
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
that would be that it would remain
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
limited to Veterans and would not
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
Encompass the newly defined
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
individuals and with that I'm happy to
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for that I was
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
trying to make some notes while you were
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
speaking um on these on the technical
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
points that you raised
 
01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
I would ask if you could uh have you
 
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
submitted anything in writing I have not
 
01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
but I am happy to do so if that would be
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
of benefit if you could uh as I
 
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned to representative Roy if you
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
could get um
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
your uh recommended technical
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
considerations to me uh by Monday or
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
Tuesday at the latest so that if if we
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
do need to make any language changes
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
after reviewing uh your written
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
submission uh we'll have time to to do
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
that more than happy to absolutely okay
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
questions all right uh thank you for
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
being here my pleasure thank you seeing

01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh you can have uh more than more

time than that the representative if you
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
times in those 30 years and I commanded
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
several thousands of soldiers who also
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
moved all the
 
01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.430 align:start position:0%
moved all the
time

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
and the challenges both within schools
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
for the kids kids going into new schools
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
and for spouses finding employment are
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
substantial and if we as a legislature
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
can make it easier for those 500
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
families in the state of New Hampshire I
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%

was a New Hampshire presence on that
 
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
boat um I believe there were more than
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
one but
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
most uh prominent was uh one of the
 
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
senior officers who just passed away
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%

01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
so uh welcome RS of Barton um thank you
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%

looking at here yes thank you Mr
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um I just want add uh I support
 
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
this uh piece of legislation recently I
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
watched a a video on YouTube with an
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
interview of a member of uh of that
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
particular crew who spoke about that
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
incident um during that interview and he
 
01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
must be around 80 80 years old there
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
aren't too many survivors of of this um
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
he spoke that it was very hush hush um
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
they weren't allowed to speak about
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened um he said that
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't receive uh aid from our own
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
ships neighboring by and there seemed to
 
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
be some kind of um questionable activity
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
that has gone um really unanswered for
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
the people who lost uh
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily um family members um many
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
years ago and by the IDF and um they
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
they never got the answers that they
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
deserved from the the Fed so I think for
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire constituents um we we
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
owe them uh the decency in respect of of
 
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
a response to at least look into this
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
and and press our um our federal
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
delegation uh to uh to pursue
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative just a
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
comment I described the bill when I
 
01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
introduced it um what I want to do here
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
is just clarify that the intent of this
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
bill is to establish a committee to
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
study the federal government's response
 
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
to the 1960s have an attack on the USS
 
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
Liberty so the the issue that the
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee this committee is going to
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision on is whether we
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
support a a committee being established
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
or not and that's something that we we
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
going to continue to take testimony
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about it and we'll
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
eventually exec this and make a decision
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
on that uh I was am old enough to
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
remember this this incident the the
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
captain of the USS Liberty won the
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
Congressional Medal of Honor for keeping
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
his ship afloat under a horrific attack
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's something that I remember uh I
 
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
think it was 12 years old when that
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
occurred it was um a very prominent news
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
item at the time I it was in June of
 
01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.830 align:start position:0%
item at the time I it was in June of
1967

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
1967
 
01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
so my question for you is looking at the
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
membership of the proposed committee
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
should one be established uh do you have
 
01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.189 align:start position:0%
should one be established uh do you have
any

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
questions or are you comfortable with
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
the committee as
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
proposed I I didn't see proposed
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
committee members for the subcommittee I
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
I would like to be uh appointed to that
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
committee um based on knowledge and 16
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
years working with the dod um I believe
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct that there was
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of heroism in in
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
Saving that boat because the IDF took
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
out all of the radios on that boat so
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't radio for help and there
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
was one radio human who um who rigged a
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
line and and squeaked out an SOS and and
 
01:16:03.189 --> 01:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
still that help was delayed but they
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
stayed afloat long enough that they
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
eventually got got assistance so there's
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
definitely a bunch of Heroes on that
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
boat and they they deserve answers I I
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't think that it was an
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
accident well I and and I know other
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
committee members have things that we
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
want to to say is and that's really more
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate for executive session we're
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
here to listen to you and and perhaps
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
ask some questions U for the F people
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
watching at home the
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee proposed committee shall be as
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
follows four members of the House of
 
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives appointed by the speaker
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
one member of the Senate appointed by
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
the president of the Senate uh one
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
member of the public appointed by the
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
governor so that would be a uh a
 
01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.669 align:start position:0%
governor so that would be a uh a
six-person

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
six-person
 
01:16:49.629 --> 01:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
committee and the members of the
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee their duties would be to study
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government's response
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
specific Ally investigate to the best of
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
its ability whether the US government
 
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
properly determined the culpability of
 
01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
Israeli civilian and military officials
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
in that attack so that's the proposal uh
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
any anything else for um representative
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
Baron he who is not listed as a
 
01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.669 align:start position:0%
Baron he who is not listed as a
sponsor

01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
um but he is a uh a supporter questions
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
for representative represent mandle
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
bomb thank you Mr chairman so I want to
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
First say that I am empathetic toward
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
the members of this crew and their
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
families and thank you for their heroism
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
what I would love a little bit more
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
clarity around is what Gap this
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee would fill because it seems to
 
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
me like there was a fairly thorough
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
investigation of this attack um the
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
Israeli government has apologized for it
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
and provided compensation to the US
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
government to um to um to give to the 34
 
01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
men killed in the attack could you just
 
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit what you're looking
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
to get out of this committee yes
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um you're you're correct
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
in all of your statements um what we
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't have and what we never got was
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
answers as to actually what happened
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
this committee could um could interview
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
with surviving crew members who are
 
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
getting much much older and uh we could
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
get answers from I'll interview all of
 
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
them and and do uh do the research to
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
actually give um
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh a clear concise research well
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
researched uh answer not something that
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government came up with uh
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
to protect one of our allies um so that
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
would be I would uh expect the interest
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
of this committee um to to get the real
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
answers and actually get that out there
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
it's the real answers are deserved
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so there
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
haven't been any any books or videos or
 
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
any other material that use um direct
 
01:19:08.669 --> 01:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
interviews from
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
survivors I I believe that there was a
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
gag order or the equivalent of a gag
 
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
order of all the crewmen and now that
 
01:19:20.590 --> 01:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
they're getting close to uh dying they
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
don't care anymore and they're willing
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
to speak regardless of the con
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
consequences so we may actually be able
 
01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
happened another followup go ahead thank
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so if these service
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
members are providing their
 
01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.709 align:start position:0%
members are providing their
testimony

01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
um and and breaking this gag order would
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
that put any would there be any
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
potential consequences for the State of
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this committee if
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to do that I not an
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
expert on on those laws but I suspect
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
that they would be uh of federal orders
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
and um not under the purview of the
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire it would be
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary testimony at at their own risk
 
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
voluntary testimony at at their own risk
thank

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
you okay represent Bon I know uh you're
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to be here to be the you're the
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of hcr8 which is coming
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
later okay so I have two cards so you're
 
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
not a sponsor of 256 but you're speaking
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
it anything else for yes represent
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
f um I just had kind of a clarification
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
on representative mandal bomb's question
 
01:20:57.149 --> 01:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
so when I was reading up on uh the
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
incident I saw that there are many books
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
and I think at least one documentary so
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
none of those interviewed
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
survivors uh I haven't read every every
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
book but what I am aware of is that um
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
there was a uh an an order for these
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
crew members not to speak since right
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
after the attack um and uh most of the
 
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
crewmen kept that order there have been
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
some interviews where where crew members
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
are speaking out for the reasons that I
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
said but um I think that it's an
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get all surviving members
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
of of that ship to um to testify before
 
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee and uh you know give us a
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
very clear concise um
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know story of what actually
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
happened that we could put out as a
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
state and that we could press um press
 
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
the FED on and say hey what you that
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
happen represent floss yeah um a
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
followup so what's the
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
expectation that uh this testimony from
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
survivors would
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh what's the end goal I suppose uh what
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
do you want the federal government to do
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
after this
 
01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:23.719 align:start position:0%
committee I I would expect that when we
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
find the answer aners that we didn't get
 
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
from the FED that we deserved many years
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
ago um that uh that they would release
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
information similar to uh some of the uh
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
the information that was released on on
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
the assassinations of RFK and Martin
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
Luther King and JFK I think probably
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
some of the the case stuff would be
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
unsealed and um I think there would be
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
they would be more apt to do that um in
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
in uh in DC if we came and said hey we
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
have the goods right here we know most
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
of the story that we didn't get from
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
actual I Witnesses tell us the rest of
 
01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:05.629 align:start position:0%
actual I Witnesses tell us the rest of
the

01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:05.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
story I think it would be a good good
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
means to to uh pressure I think that's
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of the Prime sponsors um
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
putting this
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
forward represent mle bomb thank you Mr
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
chairman so so to
 
01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
clarify the intent is to better
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
understand the US government's role
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
situation um I guess
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
I just back up for a moment there has
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
been a lot of criticism of Israel lately
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
just given um the ongoing conflicts in
 
01:23:43.149 --> 01:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
the Middle East and I'm a bit
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
might might be be biased against our
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
Ally or might be looking
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
to seek further justice from them from
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
them is this really just focused on the
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
US government's
 
01:24:08.229 --> 01:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
role uh I would expect it's not um I you
 
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
know I'm again I'm not the prime sponsor
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
of this legislation I speak in in
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
support of it um I I support Israel but
 
01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.350 align:start position:0%
support of it um I I support Israel but
in

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
1967 something happened and uh and you
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
know it it doesn't doesn't seem right
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
and we ought to have the the real clear
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%

my support for this very important
legislation

01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:26:37.679 --> 01:26:39.390 align:start position:0%
legislation
the

01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
men the service people who are on that
 
01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
boat have not been heard by the United
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
States government for 58 years there was
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
a false investigation that happened
 
01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
false investigation paty investigation
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
that the the federal government held to
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
lie about what happened on that boat the
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
official story the American people were
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
given that that was that that boat was
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
attacked for 5 minutes by one torpedo
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
and that an immediate apology was given
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
that could not be further from the truth
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
and I you know there's people here who
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
were on that boat who are going to
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
testify to that so I won't speak to that
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
too much but to me Mr chairman the state
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has the opportunity
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
here to
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
be to stand strong and our
 
01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
transparent open government that we take
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
pride in and open up the books and
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
transparency and start the first genuine
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
investigation into this issue that has
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
occurred these again I'll let these men
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
speak to it themselves but what they
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
went through on that boat is horrifying
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
as I was sitting back there listening to
 
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
other people testify I had to listen to
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
them remember it and remembering it
 
01:27:57.109 --> 01:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
right now as they sit here as they have
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
to come constantly to state after State
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
testifying retelling their story just to
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
get heard by their government these
 
01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.270 align:start position:0%
get heard by their government these
people

01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
served in one of the most dangerous
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
times that this world has faced maybe
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
other than now and here they are saying
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
the government lied about what we went
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
through and we're going to say well we
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
won't even study it we we have a study
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
committee here before us this isn't
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislation with a stick this isn't
 
01:28:31.109 --> 01:28:31.119 align:start position:0%
doing anything other than saying that
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to study the issue and how
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
however you might feel about the issue I
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
think you should look into it if you
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
feel differently than angry that the
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
government has lied about it you should
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
want a study committee because no
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
answers have been given about this so
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
I'm 21 years old I was far from alive in
 
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.229 align:start position:0%
I'm 21 years old I was far from alive in
the

01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
1967 but I'm here today because I'm a
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
student of history and I'm tired of the
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
United States government lying to its
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
people and as a member of the state
 
01:29:03.149 --> 01:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
government of n Hampshire who has sworn
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
an oath to the United States
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution I feel it's my duty to
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
speak up in favor of these men who
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
served our nation and have been lied to
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
by their leaders so I don't really have
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
anything other than that to say and I
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
questiones but other people will speak
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
more eloquently to this that I can all
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman so again I'm
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
not I'm not doubting the veracity of of
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
the claims by the survivors who are here
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
in this room today I thank you for your
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
service and appreciate you stepping
 
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
forward on this matter I'm just trying
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
to get a sense of the whole situation
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
here um and representative wheeler you
 
01:29:47.350 --> 01:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
said twice that there was a false
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
investigation that the federal
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
government helds apart from the
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
testimony of these survivors what
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
evidence do you have that it was a false
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
investigation uh it's my opinion and
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
they lied about the investigation
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of evidence that if you
 
01:30:06.189 --> 01:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
go back and listen and watch the
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
testimony about the investigation you
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
read up on it that investigation was
 
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my
 
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
question if you allow me I'd like to
 
01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:33.639 align:start position:0%
read a short exerpt and ask the witness
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
for his opinion on what I have here we
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
do need a question so if this leads to a
 
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
question uh it would go ahead it would
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
lead to this
 
01:30:48.669 --> 01:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
hopefully okay uh there was a commission
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
set up by the government by by Jag but
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
Judge Advocate General in June of
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
1967 uh I was assigned as there's a
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
captain here I was assigned as senior
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
legal counsel for the Navy's Court of
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
inquiry to the brutal attack on USS
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
Liberty which had occurred in June 8th
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
the late Admiral Isaac kid president of
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
the court and I were given only one week
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
to gather evidence for the Navy's
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
official investigation into the attack
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that we both had
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
estimated that a proper Court of inquiry
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
into an attack of this magnitude would
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
take at least 6 months to
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
conduct now I'm going to skip a whole
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
stuff it was our shared belief based on
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
the documentary evidence and testimony
 
01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:37.390 align:start position:0%
the documentary evidence and testimony
we

01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
were that we received
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
firstand that the Israeli attack was
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
planned and deliberate and could not
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
possibly have been an
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
accident I continue I'm skipping a whole
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff so so I can get your your
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
comments Admiral kid and I both felt it
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to travel to Israel to
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
interview the Israelis who took part in
 
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
the attack Admiral kid telephoned
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
Admiral McCain to discuss making
 
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
arrangements Admiral McCain
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
higher used the boss Admiral kid later
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
told me that Admiral McCain was adamant
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
that we were not to travel to Israel or
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
contact the Israelis concerning this
 
01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.830 align:start position:0%
contact the Israelis concerning this
matter

01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to end here I think I know
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
from personal conversations I had with
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
Admiral kid at president Lyndon Johnson
 
01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
and Secretary of Defense Robert magn
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
magn magn excuse me magnam the dod
 
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
ordered him to conclude that the attack
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
was a case of mistaken identity despite
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
overwhelming evidence to the contrary
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
Admiral kid told me after returning from
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
Washington DC that he had been ordered
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
to sit down with two civili from either
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
the White House or the defense
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
department and rewrite portions of the
 
01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:02.350 align:start position:0%
department and rewrite portions of the
Court

01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
hearings sorry about that
 
01:33:09.669 --> 01:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
okay yeah the other way I got one must
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
be almost done I'm sorry I apologize for
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
the delay here but this I feel is
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
important because I was a sa and there
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
is a question coming there is absolutely
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
coming Admiral kid also told me that he
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
had been ordered to put the lid on
 
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
everything having to do with the attack
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
on USS Liberty we were never to speak of
 
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
it and we were to caution everyone else
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
involved that they could never speak of
 
01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.709 align:start position:0%
involved that they could never speak of
it

01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
again what say you on this matter I say
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
that you know best as a sailor yourself
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
a member of the Navy that that is what
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
happened and there is a number of
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
information out there a lot of
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
information about Lyndon Johnson
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
attitude towards this attack and how he
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
did not care about those soldiers who
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
were being bombarded doesn't matter who
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
the country that was bombarding them you
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
have your you're the commanderin-chief
 
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
you have soldiers being bombarded your
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
ship is being sunk it does not matter
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
who is shooting at you you take action
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
and he instead of taking action took
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
action to help rewrite Court hearings he
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
took action the commission took action
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
to rushed them as was stated the Admiral
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
said that he had one week to gather what
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
he said he needed 6 months to gather
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean when I say false
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
investigation you have people in power
 
01:34:36.990 --> 01:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
who have a vested interest in not
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
telling the truth who are out there
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
trying to say oh we we'll study the
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
issue and then producing a report such
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
as this we have before us an opportunity
 
01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
to genuinely study this issue to compile
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
that information in a official state
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
government commissioned committee that
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
we have charged with the power that we
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
have as legislators and I think
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative PL or gagy you're
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct that that's that's
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
one of the many pieces of information
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
that should be brought forward in a
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
study committee like
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
this other questions seeing none thank
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
you representative wheeler a student of
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
History we can't have too many students
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
of history in my opinion no we can as a
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
history need more we need more okay uh
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
we do have a finite amount of time as
 
01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
always uh but we have at least I think
 
01:35:33.629 --> 01:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
at least a couple survivors from that
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
ship and who have traveled some distance
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
and have taken some time so I definitely
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we give them some
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
time uh we don't have unlimited time but
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh we want very much to hear from them
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh we heard from uh we did had a this
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
measure a year year ago or last term and
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
spent uh a great deal of time on it so

we're already uh Fair those of us who've
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
been on the committee already fairly

familiar with with the uh the incident
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%

01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%

screams I didn't know what the hell is
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
going on then all of a sudden it's a
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
general alarm about the horn starts
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
ringing man your Battle Stations man
 
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
your Battle
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
Stations so we all start taking off and
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
all three of us head out start heading
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
towards the hatch goes out from my my
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
little shop was just had a hallway
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
across it and there was a hatch and
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
Stairway Smitty went out the door first
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
and he went
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
Left Post he went out second and he went
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
right and I could take the stair away
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
but before the stairway I looked out the
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
door I saw the plane banking straighten
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
out and I started
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
firing you could see the Sparks from the
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
from the wings and he was firing at at
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
Smitty I knew it I knew he was going to
 
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.350 align:start position:0%
Smitty I knew it I knew he was going to
get

01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
him then I looked at that plane again
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
and I thought I thought the pilot saw me
 
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
so I turned and ran for the stairs and I
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
dove and as I'm do my room is like
 
01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.310 align:start position:0%
dove and as I'm do my room is like
lighting

01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
lighting
 
01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
up and luckily my body was underneath
 
01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.270 align:start position:0%
up and luckily my body was underneath
the

01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
stairway uh down below me uh there was a
 
01:40:36.629 --> 01:40:36.639 align:start position:0%
men waiting to come upstairs but they
 
01:40:40.709 --> 01:40:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm sorry this is my first
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
I made it down to the stairs and ran ran
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
through the the
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
galley and through the galley I I got
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%

01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
have been first and then
 
01:41:26.109 --> 01:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
and Steve gersack was the second and
 
01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
then then Lieutenant we all showed
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
up we started talking we grabbed our
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
phones and we started talking and each
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
time the planes were coming they were
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
making a figure over the top of our of
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
our ship and when they when those
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
bullets would come you think you're in a
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
barrel and it was loud very loud I'm
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
still ringing in my ears from
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh this went on sle times that the
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
planes would go one way and then the
 
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
other way and this rattle come down the
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
St the ship would vibrate and you could
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
feel it and you could feel it
 
01:42:20.990 --> 01:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
tilt and the screams after just about
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.709 --> 01:42:29.719 align:start position:0%
we got
 
01:42:29.719 --> 01:42:31.550 align:start position:0%
we got
going

01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll look at my notes for a minute
 
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
down they did about eight
 
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
swipes a piece those
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
ples and then those eight wipes they
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
wiped out all of the all of the antennas
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
all all the Gunners there's four on his
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
post he was cut in half he got hit by a
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
40 caliber uh 40 mm
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
Cannon nobody lives through that Smitty
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
was hit with a through the butt with a
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
50 caliber machine gun on it on a route
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
to go going now Smitty was
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
later but posting of them made at that
 
01:43:19.119 --> 01:43:25.470 align:start position:0%
later but posting of them made at that
time

01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh I felt tremendous pressure from those
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
bullets and and it made and it became
 
01:43:35.229 --> 01:43:35.239 align:start position:0%
silent when when we when the planes were
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
empty and about and I talking to virgal
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
he was telling me of what was taking
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
areas and then he said there's two big
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
planes coming two big planes
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
coming and all of a sudden they're
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
dropping Napal Napal was very hot fire
 
01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
bombs one of them hit right over that
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
deck right there we were one floor below
 
01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
below the deck right against the the
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
bridge so we were exposed and one of the
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
bombs landed either directly on us or
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
right at right next to us that the room
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
got so down hot that we thought we would
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
have we' have to get out but we had
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
dispatched a fire crew and a fire crew
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%

01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
the blast I I we were unaware of it but
 
01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
Virgil told me he says you guys are
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
trapped in that room you can't get
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
out so when they we had the sign of
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
repel borders when they said repel
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
borders that means we go grab our guns
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
and we can fight by handguns off off off
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the ship well they they didn't
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
plan on the armor being cut in half and
 
01:48:31.709 --> 01:48:31.719 align:start position:0%
losing the only man with the key to get
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
weapons we were we were going to we were
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
all going knew we were dead
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
then the
 
01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.109 align:start position:0%
then the
uh

01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
uh then the pilot one out of the pilot
 
01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:53.719 align:start position:0%
one of the helicopters came to the
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
bridge and Virgil is telling me
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
everything is going on he said the the
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
Comm the helicopter came real close and
 
01:49:02.350 --> 01:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
they took a mic and they said can we
 
01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:03.470 align:start position:0%
they took a mic and they said can we
help

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
you so that meant that word got
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
out and we and somebody knew that Israel
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
was attacking a
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
ship the captain gave him the
 
01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
finger and they turned around and took
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
off again that's my story of that can I
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
tell you one more thing sure two days
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
later Admiral kid came on the
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
boat and he he had he in front got in
 
01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:35.239 align:start position:0%

01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
takes his bars off his collar and he
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
said he commended us for being such
 
01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:41.510 align:start position:0%
said he commended us for being such
strong

01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
strong
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
men only there's only about 70 of us
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
guys left everybody else is gone in the
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
helicopters and gone
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
right we had loaded 17 were wounded and

34 men were dead were all off the
 
01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
ship he took he took those those offers
 
01:50:03.229 --> 01:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
and he commanded commanded us he thought
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
we we did a wonderful job and then he
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
asked for a few comments he got him then
 
01:50:11.149 --> 01:50:11.159 align:start position:0%
he puts his bars back on and he said no
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
guys if you ever say one word to your
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
friend or your family or anybody each
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
other I'll put you in jail and you ain't
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
ever going to come out and he repeated
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
that a couple times and took
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
off and this is from Admiral kid that's
 
01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
from animal kid now I have been angry at
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
that son of a ever
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
since he destroyed my faith in this
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
government well I think uh I think that
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
we get that and again I've already
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
thanked you once I'll thank you again
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
for your very compelling in in Brave
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
testimony here uh the one question that
 
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
I did want to ask you and you can
 
01:51:04.109 --> 01:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
probably answer yes or no um do you
 
01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
think the federal
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
government was engaged in a major
 
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:11.800 align:start position:0%
coverup that still needs attention
 
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt there's no question in
 
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
my mind I'll take that as a yes that's a
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh anyone else have any questions uh
 
01:51:19.199 --> 01:51:20.790 align:start position:0%
yes uh anyone else have any questions uh
represent

01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:51:23.709 --> 01:51:23.719 align:start position:0%
Foss thank you so much for for coming
 
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
here and for your bravery um in your
 
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
like perfect world I suppose what do you
 
01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
want the federal government to do if
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
this committee does find that the
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
investigation was uh I suppose at the
 
01:51:43.990 --> 01:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
the very least inadequate what what is
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
it that um that just personally you know
 
01:51:49.229 --> 01:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
because I know you can't speak for all
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
survivors what is your ideal outcome My
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
outcome is to have them apologize to
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
each and each and every one of
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
us just it's all you know and not make a
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
mistake like that again for somebody
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%

01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%

minutes we we we do have we a schedule
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we're obviously going to be
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
somewhat flexible with I do uh want to

here right there uh I don't want to have
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
any time limit on him um because he's
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
come from um Florida and uh I I think uh
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
Mr L is a Survivor I'm pretty
 
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
of the liberty so uh please tell us what
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
you'd like like us to hear uh first of
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
all I want to thank Tom this is the
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
first time he's ever talked openly about
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
what he saw okay I'm I uh didn't go
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
through the horrors that Tom went
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
through I was hit on the first
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
strafing I do want to say that it was an
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
incredibly beautiful day the ocean was
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
like a
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
mirror and my biggest problem now is
 
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever asked me officially what I
 
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
saw or what happened that
 
01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:02.109 align:start position:0%
saw or what happened that
day

01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
and they accepted I made a mistake I
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
didn't know it was a US
 
01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
ship okay the day was beautiful I saw
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
one of the fighters it was an unmarked
 
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
Mirage French Mirage jet I'm told he was
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
flying the same way we were and he
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't even 60 feet above us
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
I could have waved to the pilot that day
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
and he could have waved back that's how
 
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
close he was and I turned I was going
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
going up to the 04 level that's the
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
highest deck you could be on the ship
 
01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
outside and it was just the full width
 
01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
of the ship but maybe 15 ft in
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
size and I turned to the officer up
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
there that's supposed to identify all
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
the planes that go by and I said did you
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
see that fighter sir and he said no
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
where is it and I walked closer to him
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
and turned to point to the fighter that
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
I saw and that's when the first
 
01:56:03.629 --> 01:56:03.639 align:start position:0%
strafing uh it came by and like Tom
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
explained the ship shook like crazy and
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
I looked down and there was blood coming
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
out of every part of my body and I
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
looked at the lieutenant and he looked
 
01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
just like me and I said hey I'm getting
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
the F out of here and I ran hit the
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
ladder just like you see in the movies I
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
slid down didn't touch a rung got inside
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
the 03 level inside the ship and there
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
was glass everywhere and I didn't
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
realize it but my leg had knee had been
 
01:56:31.390 --> 01:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
shattered and I fell to the deck and
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
crawled down another deck inside the
 
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.350 align:start position:0%
crawled down another deck inside the
ship

01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
ship
 
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh at that point uh one of my uh
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
Shipmates and this is comical how crazy
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
the mine works I was crawling around the
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
corner going into office's country and
 
01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
he goes are you hurt and I honestly
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
looked up to this shipmate of mine and
 
01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
says no I like crawling on the deck and
 
01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
we both laughed I mean I can't get over
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
that I even could do that but we did
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
laugh but anyhow you threw a tourin on
 
01:57:04.990 --> 01:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
my leg and went and to get help to bring
 
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
me down to Sick Bay and I don't know how
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
long it took him to get there uh but I
 
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
know I did black out a lot a number of
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
times before he got back and they threw
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
a tourniquet on my leg they put me in a
 
01:57:18.669 --> 01:57:18.679 align:start position:0%
stret and started carrying me down into
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
Sick Bay uh as we're turning the corner
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
the Corman came by and told him take the
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
tourniquet off his leg we don't want him
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
to lose it and uh with that they put me
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
on the deck and he starts on tying it
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
and a rocket comes through the overhead
 
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
now I'm two decks inside the ship and I
 
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
can see blue sky and the only time you
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
ever saw a cloud was a little white
 
01:57:41.870 --> 01:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
cloud on that hole where the rocket had
 
01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:43.430 align:start position:0%
cloud on that hole where the rocket had
come

01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:57:46.270 --> 01:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
through then I blanked out and I woke up
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
in sick Bay uh which was the mes decks
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
they converted all the tables into beds
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
and put mats uh mattresses on and I can
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
remember uh passing out waking up and
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
one time I woke up prepared for torpedo
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
attack I remember hearing that I don't
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
remember the torpedo
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
hitting I do remember hearing prepare to
 
01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.350 align:start position:0%
hitting I do remember hearing prepare to
Abandoned

01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
Abandoned
 
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
Ship uh and I don't know if I blacked
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
out anymore or not but I do remember
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
them canceling the abandoned ship and
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
later on I had heard what Tom Tom had
 
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
told you uh they were sinking the life
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
rafts as they threw them over the side
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming the captain thought we
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
were safer to stay on the ship as long
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
as it didn't sink then to try to go over
 
01:58:33.440 --> 01:58:34.390 align:start position:0%
as it didn't sink then to try to go over
the

01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
side uh again it was a beautiful day
 
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
there's no way that ship that plane did
 
01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
not know we were an American ship on the
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
bow we had a letter g 10 ft
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
tall tr5 general research technical
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
vessel is what we were on it was a spy
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
ship it was controlled I'm told by the
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
NSA and unfortunately with a torpedo hit
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
was the only
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
place that the the torpedo could hit us
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
without sinking us within six inches
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
either way or the other the split ship
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
would have split in half and we would
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
have all died no questions in my mind
 
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
um you brought up a number of things
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make comments on uh I
 
01:59:24.069 --> 01:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
did not have Admiral
 
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
kid tell me what he told my Shipmates
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
but every one of my Shipmates have said
 
01:59:33.149 --> 01:59:33.159 align:start position:0%
the same thing I have never ever once
 
01:59:36.030 --> 01:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
been officially asked by any government
 
01:59:38.350 --> 01:59:38.360 align:start position:0%
what I saw that
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
day and to me if you're doing an
 
01:59:43.069 --> 01:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
investigation every crew member has to
 
01:59:43.079 --> 01:59:43.990 align:start position:0%
investigation every crew member has to
be

01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
questioned now Admiral kid took a bunch
 
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
of them all together and asked them a
 
01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
question and they answered and then they
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
were sworn not to talk about it for the
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
rest of their lives uh from what I
 
01:59:58.669 --> 01:59:58.679 align:start position:0%
understand the Admiral that did the
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
commissioned people on board the ship
 
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
swore them the secrecy till the day he
 
02:00:07.629 --> 02:00:07.639 align:start position:0%
died and he died 15 years later and
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's when the assault of the Liberty
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
came out and that's when they started
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
talking about it and I think we just
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
figured we could too so we started
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
talking myself I went from the Liberty
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
to the USS America an aircraft
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
carrier uh that's where they saved my
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
life I was on there for about two months
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
they shipped me to Naples Italy they put
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
us on the top floor so they could
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
control anybody that could come up and
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
ask us
 
02:00:39.430 --> 02:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions I was on in uh Naples when
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
they tried to take out some of the
 
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
shrapnel of me I had four cardiac
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
arrests while they were doing that so
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
the doctor said we'll leave them in and
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
if you ever have problems we'll take
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
them out when you have problems I still
 
02:00:55.790 --> 02:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
have 52 pieces of shrapnel in
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
me I went from Naples Italy to the Army
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
hospital in
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
Germany when I got to the Germany
 
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
hospital they put me in a a ward where
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
there had to be 15 Vietnam veterans from
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
the Vietnam War injured I wasn't there
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
three minutes they picked me up put me
 
02:01:16.310 --> 02:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
on a gurnie brought me to a private room
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
and some officer came in and says your
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
name is
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
Smith and if anyone ask you about the
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
Liberty you know nothing now me being a
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
dumb 23y old kid I figured while I was
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
in the hospital that's the only time I
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
had to be quiet I didn't get the threat
 
02:01:35.069 --> 02:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
that Tom and the crew that didn't get
 
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:38.679 align:start position:0%
injured happened the crew was only
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
294 men that's all we had 174 were
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
wounded 34 were
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
I'm

02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
sorry it never
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
stops my problem is the United States
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
believed Israel that it was a
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
mistake the ship they claim that was the
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
the ship that was shelling the beach and
 
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
you can't shell the beach with 54 54
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
5050 caliber guns was half the size
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't even
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
seaworthy it was a animal a cow ship
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
that they they sh shipped cows or cattle
 
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
or something
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
on the Liberty was an Immaculate ship it
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
was no way you could make a mistake that
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
it was anything other than a US
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
vessel the captain was the biggest pain
 
02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
in the butt that anyone could be because
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
he followed the
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
book going from Norfork to Africa which
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
was our new normal Duty station if I
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
went out without a hat on I'd have been
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
put on report if I didn't salute an
 
02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:55.719 align:start position:0%
officer I'd have been put on report this
 
02:02:58.229 --> 02:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
is how ridiculous the captain was we had
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
General quarter drills which is to
 
02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
practice for attacks two three times a
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
week I can remember thinking to myself
 
02:03:11.069 --> 02:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
this guy's crazy he's too much of this
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
baloney thank God he did
 
02:03:17.229 --> 02:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
it the only reason why life today is cuz
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
he trained everybody to do to do the
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
right thing I was the electrical
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
department I was in charge of the
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
electricity for the ship my duty station
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
was the generator one of the most
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
important parts you can have when you're
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
in a battle you have to have electricity
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
to keep the ship
 
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
running I was hit under for a
 
02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:44.440 align:start position:0%
strafing okay but my uh my crew knew how
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
to to act and keep that ship going
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
because he was we were trained so well
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
by our captain
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the captain got the
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
Medal of Honor yes but they insulted us
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
he got it from the secretary of the Navy
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
in the Naval Shipyard and any other time
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
anyone got the Medal of Honor they got
 
02:04:07.030 --> 02:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
it at the White House from the president
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
of the United
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
States and he deserved the Medal of
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
Honor the the doctor was seriously
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
injured and kept us all alive he
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
deserved probably the Medal of Honor too
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
for not letting anybody that got into
 
02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
that room except one person die die
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
everyone else survived and the
 
02:04:27.629 --> 02:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
lieutenant commander that died stayed
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
away too long by the time he got there
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%

predecessor I think I know the answer do
 
02:05:10.109 --> 02:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
do you think that the federal government
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
um covered up uh a serious situation
 
02:05:18.629 --> 02:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
here yes no doubt in my mind I I figured
 
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
that would be your answer that's kind of
 
02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
why we're here um representative
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%

still um I'm also going to ask the same
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
question what do you want from the
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
federal government what's your ideal
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
outcome for me not to feel like they
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
think I'm a liar
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
I want the truth what I saw what I told
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
you that day if you want me to take a a
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
oath to tell you that I'm telling you
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
the truth I'm not afraid to do any of
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
that uh the truth that we they
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
intentionally attacked us knowing we
 
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
were a US
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
vessel the our commanderin-chief
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
President Johnson two times called
 
02:06:20.189 --> 02:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
planes that were coming to our
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
Aid wouldn't allow them come to our Aid
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
when we were on our way into the
 
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
Mediterranean now normally our our duty
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
station was the west coast of Africa
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
we'd spent three months going up and
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
down the west coast of Africa in the Spy
 
02:06:37.149 --> 02:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
section of the ship I'm assuming listen
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
to what was going on the beach and we
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
were in Aban at the time of the Six Day
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
War started and then we were ordered to
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
go into the Mediterranean now I've been
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
told that the captain asked for a
 
02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.229 align:start position:0%
told that the captain asked for a
Destroyer

02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
Destroyer
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
Escort because we only had 450 caliber
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
guns we should have never been in that
 
02:06:58.109 --> 02:06:58.119 align:start position:0%
war zone without an
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
escort the Admiral told the captain that
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
he can have air strike help within 12
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
minutes anywhere in the Mediterranean so
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
the captain accepted that as okay we'll
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
be okay now like Tom
 
02:07:15.549 --> 02:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned first of all they jammed all
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
our frequencies to call out emergency we
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
even though the equipment was working we
 
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't get anything else Mayday but we
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
did somehow get one Mayday out because
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
the USS America and the USS Saratoga
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
sent planes to our
 
02:07:33.549 --> 02:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
Aid and with that and again I'm only
 
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
only tell you what uh Commander Lewis
 
02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
told me he was really hurt bad uh when
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
he when the attack happened and he went
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
on uh a fret or a destroyer I don't know
 
02:07:48.510 --> 02:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
what ship it wasn't the America and he
 
02:07:50.109 --> 02:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
met with the Admiral so I'm assuming it
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
was the flagship and the Admiral told
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
him that he called the U the the us and
 
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
told him that he was sending planes to
 
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
help the liberty and I was he told us
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
that magnam called the planes back
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
magnam being the Secretary of Defense uh
 
02:08:10.510 --> 02:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
God bless you and and God bless the
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
folks who uh the medical people who did
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
what they did uh back in
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
1967 uh I think we need to remember them
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
as well uh I know you came a long way
 
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:23.000 align:start position:0%

02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
when the Israeli
 
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
Jets came on and and started their
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
action were you you said you were on the
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
04 deck yes that's top side right
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
correct is that around the signal signal
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
bridge over the pilot house it's above
 
02:10:42.030 --> 02:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
it it's yeah above the pilot house is
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
that correct two decks above the pil
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
that was a signal man okay did you
 
02:10:49.229 --> 02:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
notice that day if we had the American
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
flag flying uh I can't tell you that I
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
looked up and saw it okay before then
 
02:10:57.310 --> 02:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
when you were on way seen many times my
 
02:10:58.750 --> 02:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
belief on that could you tell me could
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
you tell me approximately how big that
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
flag is was I would assume about the
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
size of that flag there pretty much a
 
02:11:08.709 --> 02:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
standard one it was the regular flag not
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
not the holiday one yet probably a 5 by
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
seven yeah I think I was a sign I was in
 
02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
charge of the bunting Locker okay okay
 
02:11:20.149 --> 02:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
so followup uh thank you sir thank you
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
for your
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
I really don't have much of anything
 
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
else except that I I think I would go
 
02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
after the then Administration more what
 
02:11:33.950 --> 02:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
gave the Israelis the The Authority or
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
the freedom to do what they did know I I
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
my and my personal opinion sir if you
 
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
agree with me or not is that they had
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
like a cart
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
blanch to try to get us involved this is
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
really probably executive session
 
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
material I apologize to you chairman I
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
have no more questions and uh and we
 
02:11:56.430 --> 02:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
need to let you go Fair Winds following
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
Seas thank you for coming here uh we're
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're not done with this and um as I
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
said before God bless you and I want to
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
get to the last two cards can I say one
 
02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
more thing of course okay on the second
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
planes coming to our Aid now I can tell
 
02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
you what I thought the plane I saw was
 
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
UNM moed it attacked us I thought it was
 
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
Egypt and I believe the crew the rest of
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
the crew felt the same way I
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
did but again Commander Lewis talking to
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
the Admiral the Admiral had told him
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
that Johnson turned back the second
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
flight and said to him we will not
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
embarrass our allies so we're in the
 
02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
battle that the battle lasted two hours
 
02:12:51.750 --> 02:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
about he knows Israel is attacking us we
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
don't we think it's Egypt we thought it
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
was Egypt until did the planes have uh
 
02:13:01.229 --> 02:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
the sty David the the Napal uh PLS had
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
Napal no did they have the SC Star of
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
David I I don't think any of the but the
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
the uh torpedo bat or the uh torpedo
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
bolts that came uh they had the Star of
 
02:13:14.669 --> 02:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
David and my Shipmates told me they were
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
excited we have help coming until they
 
02:13:20.109 --> 02:13:20.119 align:start position:0%
shot the Torpedoes at us and then for an
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
hour they Circle the ship now on the
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
stern of the ship we had gtr5 on the B
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
port and starbard side in between them
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
we had Liberty in
 
02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
English the name of the ship but for an
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
hour they kept going around shooting at
 
02:13:39.149 --> 02:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
water level trying to put holes in the
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
side of the ship to sink
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
it understood okay
 
02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
understood and again should should a
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee be established uh that is the
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
type of thing that the committee would
 
02:13:51.629 --> 02:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
get into in deta
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%

02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I would like my state I would like
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
you to find compassion in your hearts to
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
let these 300 veterans finally speak the
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
truth and come out from under their gag
 
02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%

my dad was in the Navy the um the gag
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
order uh obviously has been lifted
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
because these folks have uh sounded off
 
02:15:19.229 --> 02:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
to us and it's uh on uh the worldwide
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
web it's on YouTube uh they're still
 
02:15:25.549 --> 02:15:25.559 align:start position:0%
courageous this uh is testimony that uh
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
supplements what we heard last term um
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for stepping up and saying
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
what you've said would you take a
 
02:15:34.350 --> 02:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
question or is anything absolutely
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
anything else that any other point that
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%

last card is uh Jason geard of
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
Northfield he was a state representative
 
02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
who initially brought this measure to
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
this committee last term he's asked for
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
three minutes uh welcome back uh former
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman member
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the hot mic members of the committee
 
02:16:07.430 --> 02:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just kind of cover some
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
things that I think
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
were not clearly established
 
02:16:14.549 --> 02:16:14.559 align:start position:0%
previously the fact of the matter is
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
there are still documents being held by
 
02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government that are
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
classified relating to this event I'm
 
02:16:24.189 --> 02:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
referencing an antiwar.com article by
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
Michelle K kukin she's awesome and she's
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
been fighting in court to get these
 
02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
documents released unclassified for
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
years and I just want to read a couple
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
paragraphs from this to kind of explain
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
what's going on in court the government
 
02:16:41.950 --> 02:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
responded this is a very recent I
 
02:16:43.709 --> 02:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
believe it was last month or so they
 
02:16:46.110 --> 02:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
ruled on this had we're usually careful
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
about reading other testimony but if
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
this I'm sure this is relevant uh so go
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
ahead and read that but you asked for
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
three minutes well it's quoting the
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
Court's response to the reason why they
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't declassify these documents okay
 
02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:02.599 align:start position:0%
have at it thank you in court the
 
02:17:04.110 --> 02:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
government responded in part by
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
asserting that the release of many of
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
these nearly 60-year-old Records Was
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
properly denied because the information
 
02:17:12.429 --> 02:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
they contained if disclosed quote could
 
02:17:14.589 --> 02:17:14.599 align:start position:0%
be expected to result in damage to the
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
National Security which includes defense
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
against transnational terrorism
 
02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
to to people like me who I'm just a
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
carpenter I did a little stint in the
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
state house but wasn't I left uh after
 
02:17:30.669 --> 02:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
one term I find this to be completely
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
comical the idea that we have an
 
02:17:34.190 --> 02:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
incident from the late 60s that can't be
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
released because it would cause
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
transnational terrorism I'm not too
 
02:17:39.030 --> 02:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about these men being
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
terrorists I mean what what are we
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
worried about here it there's there's
 
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
been a cover up of such a massive degree
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
that I think it's hard for us in this
 
02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
room to really kind of take it in unless
 
02:17:51.070 --> 02:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
you've been researching this which to a
 
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
very detailed degree which I do not
 
02:17:54.790 --> 02:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
claim to have done but these men lived
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
it and others have that we've we've
 
02:17:59.950 --> 02:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
gotten to the point now one of the only
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
recourse that we have is through the
 
02:18:05.230 --> 02:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
state government our federal government
 
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
has has set sail in a lot of ways and
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
they don't seem to be coming back to
 
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
reality there's a lot of entrenched
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
interests that want to see certain
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
things covered up never to see the light
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
of day again and I I'd want to just
 
02:18:19.709 --> 02:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
close with establishing why this is the
 
02:18:22.030 --> 02:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
proper venue for establishing the truth
 
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
of a a historical incident but one that
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
affects us to this day this is from the
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
same article but I just very quickly
 
02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
finally New Hampshire and Mo and other
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
states can and should act as part of a
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
vigorous federalism as James Madison
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
observed in Federalist number 45 under
 
02:18:38.309 --> 02:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution the states quote
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
retain a very extensive portion of
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
active sovereignty and state governments
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
May regarded as constituent and
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
essential parts of the federal
 
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
government as Madison elaborated in
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
federal list number 51 the United States
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
is not a single Republic but a compound
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
Republic with power surrendered by the
 
02:18:55.309 --> 02:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
people divided between two distinct
 
02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
governments the division of power
 
02:18:57.870 --> 02:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
between the federal and state
 
02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
governments creates a double security to
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
the rights of the people such that the
 
02:19:04.429 --> 02:19:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
other and it goes a little more detail
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
but the basic point is that the reason
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
we have committees in the state
 
02:19:12.629 --> 02:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
government is to research and do
 
02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
oversight on situations that need such
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
research in the F in the federal
 
02:19:19.549 --> 02:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
government the Committees have much it's
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
much easier to issue penos and get
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
testimony and the state government's
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
been we've been pretty much neutered to
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
the point that you can't really do much
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
but this is something that can be done
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
and this is why realistically this is
 
02:19:31.950 --> 02:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
why you guys are here yes it's to pass
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
bills and everything else but more
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
importantly you don't pass a bill unless
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know what the problem is and you
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
need to know what the problem is by
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
investigating that problem hopefully it
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
makes a little bit of sense but the
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
point is we need you guys to ask
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
questions and if you have any questions
 
02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:46.599 align:start position:0%
we have these folders that were set up
 
02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
by representative saor that contain all
 
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
of information that is really needed to
 
02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
kind of get a grasp on what's going on
 
02:19:55.150 --> 02:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
including the obituary of Commander
 
02:19:57.309 --> 02:19:57.319 align:start position:0%
Lewis who was from colbrook New
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he was in charge of all of
 
02:19:59.040 --> 02:19:59.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he was in charge of all of
the

02:19:59.830 --> 02:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:03.309 --> 02:20:03.319 align:start position:0%
intelligence uh the NSA guys on board
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
170 so the majority of the crew were
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
basically spies or working with them and
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
then we have emails detailing from the
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
government saying that that was the only
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
investigation the naval Court of inquiry
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
so I I would appre I would it's worth
 
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
your time to at least skim through these
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
documents understand what's going on
 
02:20:22.349 --> 02:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
this just lot of hisor context that
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in we had over an hour but
 
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
just it can't really be delved into in
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
enough death so hopefully that kind of
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
helps and thank you for that uh Mr
 
02:20:33.710 --> 02:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
gearhard so the could perhaps per Manion
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
who is a co-sponsor can could uh the
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
folder of the documents go to him or oh
 
02:20:40.510 --> 02:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
we have Matt made one for every one of
 
02:20:43.990 --> 02:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
you guys oh okay uh well there we go
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
yeah uh any any questions for the
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
original sponsor represent Lloyd
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh thank you Mr chairman
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
02:20:57.870 --> 02:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
02:20:57.880 --> 02:21:01.349 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
um

02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
what I don't I'm trying to figure out
 
02:21:04.830 --> 02:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
how to phrase this in a question so
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
please forgive me and give me a little
 
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
time to pull it together would you
 
02:21:11.950 --> 02:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
believe um so
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
what how is how would it be possible for
 
02:21:15.439 --> 02:21:17.110 align:start position:0%
what how is how would it be possible for
us

02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
to declassify or or what what do you
 
02:21:23.230 --> 02:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
think is going to happen when we come up
 
02:21:25.870 --> 02:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
with information like should this
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
committee be formed we come up with
 
02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
information we submit that to the
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
federal government and then they say
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
yeah but those records are
 
02:21:35.150 --> 02:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
classified how do we proceed at that
 
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
point because my concern I guess would
 
02:21:40.590 --> 02:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
be giving any false hope as a
 
02:21:42.910 --> 02:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
resolution my initial reaction would be
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
to stop giving them any money and just
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
stop paying the tax on federal income
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
but realistically re Trump recently
 
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
signed executive B releasing the files
 
02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:52.389 align:start position:0%
signed executive B releasing the files
on

02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
MLK the JFK assassination and I believe
 
02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.550 align:start position:0%
MLK the JFK assassination and I believe
RFK

02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
RFK
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm not I think we're at a different
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
point now that things that were
 
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
previously classified it it's it's much
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
easier now to make a push for
 
02:22:11.070 --> 02:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
declassifying these documents from the
 
02:22:13.150 --> 02:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
same era as these other documents that
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
are being de Declassified does that make
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
sense okay right to know transparency I
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
think is the point that's being made
 
02:22:27.990 --> 02:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
here uh one quickie thank you thank you
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh are you the one that uh stated that
 
02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh Pete hex who's going to be the next
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
dood would be
 
02:22:40.110 --> 02:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
amenable to getting involved with this
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
or am I have I got a different bill that
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
might that would be the defend the
 
02:22:46.429 --> 02:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
gville I believe but hey he might be on
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
board this too so we'll see yeah that he
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
designated DOD Chief defensive uh
 
02:22:56.910 --> 02:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
defense department secretary heg Seth uh
 
02:22:58.270 --> 02:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
that that had to do with defend the
 
02:23:00.910 --> 02:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
guard which is HB 104 thank you uh
 
02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
former representative thank you everyone
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
and with that uh I will call an end to
 
02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
that hearing uh I do want to say that
 
02:23:10.750 --> 02:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
the Admiral McCain that uh
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative gagy referred to in his
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
earlier reading I believe is a father of
 
02:23:17.950 --> 02:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
of John McCain correct okay at this time
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
we have one more measure this morning
 
02:23:22.590 --> 02:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
that would be hcf eight the
 
02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:24.710 align:start position:0%
that would be hcf eight the
uh

02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:27.269 --> 02:23:27.279 align:start position:0%
the concurrent resolution rep
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative Barton um is is he still
 
02:23:38.429 --> 02:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:38.439 --> 02:23:46.110 align:start position:0%
 
is

02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that should have been in the um
 
02:23:48.960 --> 02:24:19.950 align:start position:0%
um that should have been in the um
package

02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
thank you so I didn't see representative
 
02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
guy being at the beginning of the
 
02:24:27.309 --> 02:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
hearings do you remember when he came in
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:00.670 --> 02:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
okay the chair rep uh recognizes the
 
02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:01.750 align:start position:0%
okay the chair rep uh recognizes the
prime

02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
prime
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor that would be representative Bon
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
for house concurrent resolution 8 a
 
02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution is one that goes
 
02:25:13.030 --> 02:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the Senate as opposed to an HR which
 
02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
is strictly a house resolution this a
 
02:25:17.630 --> 02:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution urging Congress to
 
02:25:20.429 --> 02:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
find that the pascao river and the port
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
Smith Harbor lie within the state of New
 
02:25:24.750 --> 02:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so welcome representative
 
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
Barton and um have at it as I say chman
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
um so you may or may not know that um I
 
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
think it was under um Governor Lynch u a
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
similar resolution was passed in 2005 so
 
02:25:42.389 --> 02:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
this is like the 20y year
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
anniversary um I I worked at Portsmith
 
02:25:51.469 --> 02:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
Naval Shipyard for 16 almost 16 years
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
and uh this was a a highly contentious
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
issue and I happen to have read the uh
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
the entire um report that was uh
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
produced from Senator Bob Smith which I
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
have here and I'd like to to submit
 
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's 85 pages I only have
 
02:26:15.550 --> 02:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
one copy um I'd like to talk about this
 
02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
um but before I do the the differences
 
02:26:20.910 --> 02:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
between that 2005 resolution
 
02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
and my proposed resolution the language
 
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
is exactly the same with one exception I
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
asked the um or I I included language to
 
02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
ask the president of the United States
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
to issue an executive order to change
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
the duty stations of those service
 
02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
members and employees at Portsmouth
 
02:26:42.990 --> 02:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
Naval Shipyard from KY Maine properly to
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth New Hampshire um and uh I
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
think that's attainable um so I hope
 
02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
that we could put this resolution um
 
02:26:53.389 --> 02:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
through and it might have a little bit
 
02:26:56.429 --> 02:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
of teeth I have copies of that original
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
um hc4 I think it was a a joint yeah hc4
 
02:27:03.070 --> 02:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
from 2005 if the the committee members
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
around um now i' I'd like to get into
 
02:27:16.269 --> 02:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
some of the um the parts of this this
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
report and some of the uh the issues uh
 
02:27:22.269 --> 02:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
some history and background of of the
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
Border dispute um as I know it and in
 
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
reading the this report um and looking
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:27:36.190 --> 02:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
1977 um uh court case where uh it
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
established um the boundary of or or the
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
separation of the fishing Lanes from the
 
02:27:45.630 --> 02:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
mouth of the piscatqua out to the um IA
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
scholes um that's all that was
 
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
established there when um New Hampshire
 
02:27:53.670 --> 02:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
took issue with Maine saying hey the
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
shipyard and Badger Island they belong
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
to us because Maine was saying it's the
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
middle of the of the river well that
 
02:28:02.429 --> 02:28:02.439 align:start position:0%
wasn't that wasn't established in that
 
02:28:02.439 --> 02:28:03.950 align:start position:0%
wasn't that wasn't established in that
1977

02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
1977
 
02:28:06.950 --> 02:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
decision um when it went to the Supreme
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
Court though the Supreme Court cited um
 
02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
judicial aaple saying it was already
 
02:28:14.590 --> 02:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
decided in this case they didn't
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
separate um the mouth of the river out
 
02:28:19.510 --> 02:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
to the middle of the ocean from the
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
actual River in in land um according to
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
the documentation that was gathered uh
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
by Senator Smith's uh Team the um the
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
proper boundary of New Hampshire goes to
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
the high water mark on the main side so
 
02:28:38.910 --> 02:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
we own all of the including all islands
 
02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
and and and um small islands and all of
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
that stuff belongs to New Hampshire um
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Congress has to establish
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
that and it's never actually been
 
02:28:53.269 --> 02:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
concretely established so so the
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
resolution also asks our congressionals
 
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
to um take uh legislative action but I I
 
02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
think again issuing an executive order
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
could uh correct some of the um uh the
 
02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
tax situation of the service members and
 
02:29:12.269 --> 02:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
the um the federal employees at
 
02:29:15.150 --> 02:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Naval Shipyard um so I will
 
02:29:17.110 --> 02:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
also submit uh and I have it
 
02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
electronically but I'll submit this copy
 
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
and uh finally I have um another piece
 
02:29:30.030 --> 02:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
of evidence um this A A peculiar uh um
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
document that I've I obtained um while
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
working at the shipyard it's not
 
02:29:36.510 --> 02:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
confidential or anything it's a it's a
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
position description uh from 19 uh
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
98 um an of8 is the form type and on
 
02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:46.389 align:start position:0%
98 um an of8 is the form type and on
this

02:29:46.389 --> 02:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
form um it was originally says a duty
 
02:29:53.070 --> 02:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
station of uh Portsmouth New Hampshire
 
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
here and it was it was lined out and
 
02:29:59.309 --> 02:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
handwritten uh
 
02:29:59.319 --> 02:30:00.910 align:start position:0%
handwritten uh
K

02:30:00.910 --> 02:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
K
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
so you know for the longest time the
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
shipyard was always the shipyard
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
considered itself to be part of uh uh
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
Portsmith New Hampshire and properly so
 
02:30:14.030 --> 02:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
but I would submit this document also
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth I don't know why it
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
was pen and ined and it was not properly
 
02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:20.590 align:start position:0%
was pen and ined and it was not properly
revised

02:30:20.590 --> 02:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
revised
 
02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll take any questions
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you rep representative Barton uh
 
02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
very interesting so we're looking for
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
the president of the United States to do
 
02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
an executive order correct uh yes Mr
 
02:30:32.950 --> 02:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and there was a precedent there
 
02:30:36.910 --> 02:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
was a previous 2005 uh resolution and
 
02:30:38.469 --> 02:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
what was the resolution to that
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
resolution what what it it it was passed
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
with overwhelming bipartisan support so
 
02:30:48.910 --> 02:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
I I expect this resolution to also pass
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know maybe we can have a 20-year
 
02:30:53.710 --> 02:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
anniversary party uh to pass this
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
resolution and reaffirm our our position
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
on our boundry and uh and maybe actually
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
get something done for those um those
 
02:31:05.190 --> 02:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens that that uh work
 
02:31:07.590 --> 02:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
and serve at the
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
shipyard thank you other questions for
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
the prime represent Mand bom uh thank
 
02:31:15.790 --> 02:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so um representative Bon
 
02:31:17.389 --> 02:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
just for the record I want to make sure
 
02:31:19.469 --> 02:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
I have this correct would you say that
 
02:31:21.910 --> 02:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
the L language in this continuing
 
02:31:24.429 --> 02:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
resolution is the same as the 2005
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
resolution with the exception that the
 
02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
new resolution posits that the Portsmith
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
naal Shipyard lives in Portsmith not
 
02:31:36.269 --> 02:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
KY um I I think the language is exactly
 
02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
the same except for the request okay um

pass it around should I pass it around
 
02:31:50.550 --> 02:31:50.560 align:start position:0%

clerk to scan that or I possibly I found
 
02:32:16.670 --> 02:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
it in in a box that was going to be
 
02:32:18.950 --> 02:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
tossed out while working at the shipyard
 
02:32:20.590 --> 02:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
I think in like
 
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
2010 and I recognized it at at as that
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
report it's not classified or anything
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
like that so I'm I made a copy I did

I have experience and background on the
 
02:34:58.349 --> 02:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
issue and I've put together some key
 
02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
points that I'd like to go over with you
 
02:35:02.469 --> 02:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
some of them may have been touched on
 
02:35:03.550 --> 02:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
with by
 
02:35:06.309 --> 02:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
Joe if they've been touched on already
 
02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh you don't need to repeat them um so
 
02:35:12.269 --> 02:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh sure you just to keep things keep
 
02:35:14.590 --> 02:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
things rolling sure the Supreme Court
 
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
never decided the boundary between Maine
 
02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:17.670 align:start position:0%
never decided the boundary between Maine
and

02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the only line between between
 
02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire and Maine is a fishing
 
02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
rights line that goes from the entrance
 
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth Harbor to gospo Harbor to
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
settle a lobster dispute that's it there
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
is no boundary from the mouth of

established by
 
02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
Congress I have a nordal chart which I
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
laid it out which might be easier to see
 
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
if I only made one copy of all my
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
information so I'd like to submit
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
this good good the clerk would love to
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
put that into our folder sure all right
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
Shipyard workers have been unlawfully
 
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
taxed by Maine since the
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
1970s this happened because some
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
controller who worked at the shipyard
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
and lived in Maine unilaterally changed
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
the duty station and Duty
 
02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
location on that form that Joe presented
 
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
to you for all the shipyard
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
workers from Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
 
02:36:29.910 --> 02:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
Duty station and Duty location to kid
 
02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
main what happened when that's
 
02:36:36.670 --> 02:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
changed M get Maine now has the ability
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
to tax the shipyard workers because it's
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.469 --> 02:36:50.479 align:start position:0%
main I estimated that I personally
 
02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
as a portsman New Hampshire resident
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
gave over
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
$100,000 of my income to the state of
 
02:36:58.399 --> 02:37:00.150 align:start position:0%
$100,000 of my income to the state of
Maine

02:37:00.150 --> 02:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
02:37:04.349 --> 02:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
unlawfully let's multiply that by the
 
02:37:08.190 --> 02:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
workers since this happened we're
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
talking hundreds of millions of dollars
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
are going to
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
Maine that money lawfully should be at
 
02:37:23.389 --> 02:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
the disposal of New Hampshire
 
02:37:26.910 --> 02:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
residents estimated $5,000 a year for
 
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
every single New Hampshire resident
 
02:37:31.389 --> 02:37:31.399 align:start position:0%
whether you're Democrat Republican
 
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
whatever your affiliation is that's
 
02:37:36.830 --> 02:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
better spent here that's better spend
 
02:37:39.389 --> 02:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
doing whatever going to spending on
 
02:37:41.710 --> 02:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
businesses paying for child support
 
02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
whatever than going to main illegally
 
02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
this is hundreds of millions of dollars
 
02:37:51.030 --> 02:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
here hundreds okay
 
02:37:54.190 --> 02:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
um settling this matter would boost the
 
02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:55.750 align:start position:0%
um settling this matter would boost the
Hampshire's

02:37:55.750 --> 02:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
02:37:58.110 --> 02:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
economy for the employees be free to
 
02:38:00.830 --> 02:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
spend this income in New Hampshire if
 
02:38:00.840 --> 02:38:02.389 align:start position:0%
spend this income in New Hampshire if
they

02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:38:04.750 --> 02:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
choose the president of the United
 
02:38:06.990 --> 02:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
States can declare
 
02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
slir that the duty station and the duty
 
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
location is Portsmouth New
 
02:38:16.590 --> 02:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is legal right of the
 
02:38:20.830 --> 02:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
executive branch to do so
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
changing that one line on those SF uh
 
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually o8s they're called instantly
 
02:38:31.710 --> 02:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
cuts off Maine from getting our
 
02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
income and the Hampshire residents don't
 
02:38:37.269 --> 02:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
have to give it to Maine now if you're a
 
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
Maine resident of course you're still
 
02:38:42.030 --> 02:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
going to pay main income taxes but New
 
02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents won't now let's take
 
02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
talk about how unfair this is right
 
02:38:50.190 --> 02:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
now typically property tax in New
 
02:38:52.269 --> 02:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are
 
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
twice those in Maine because we don't
 
02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
have an income tax is one of the reasons
 
02:39:00.150 --> 02:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
so as a shipyard worker living in New
 
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm paying double the property
 
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
taxes and I'm paying main income tax
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
three okay it's not cheap living here
 
02:39:14.750 --> 02:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
anymore so that's a big
 
02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:16.309 align:start position:0%
anymore so that's a big
problem

02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:39:19.550 --> 02:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
um since as another issue is enforcement
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
of Maritime laws since there's no
 
02:39:26.190 --> 02:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
defined border it's impossible from
 
02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
reinforcement to enforce voting
 
02:39:32.910 --> 02:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
laws okay if someone's in an accident
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
because they're intoxicated and somebody
 
02:39:36.750 --> 02:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
loses their life or there's a casualty
 
02:39:38.670 --> 02:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
whatever in the middle of pisc in the
 
02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:40.550 align:start position:0%
whatever in the middle of pisc in the
piscatqua

02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
piscatqua
 
02:39:44.550 --> 02:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
river what jurisdiction are the
 
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
under nobody
 
02:39:50.269 --> 02:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
knows that's a problem
 
02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
so this is the same issue as 20 years
 
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
ago but it's
 
02:39:58.190 --> 02:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
different back then the Supreme Court
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
was not the proper venue to take this to
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
from what I've read the proper venue is
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
urging Congress to fix the Border
 
02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
dispute resolve it once and for all
 
02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:12.389 align:start position:0%
dispute resolve it once and for all
short-term

02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
fix president or directs someone to
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
change Duty station Duty location so
 
02:40:21.469 --> 02:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
immediate medely the taxes are going not
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
to main for the Hampshire residents but
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
are staying that salary staying in the
 
02:40:29.389 --> 02:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire short-term fix long-term fix
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
Congress fixes the
 
02:40:34.990 --> 02:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
border now this is nothing new as far as
 
02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
this dispute it's been going on for a
 
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
while when I was working at the shipyard
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
every time there was a news article what
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
I did is I printed it gathered them all
 
02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
together and found them all and I
 
02:40:50.349 --> 02:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
stapled them all
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
together it would be a really good idea
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
for this committee to look over these
 
02:40:56.080 --> 02:40:56.950 align:start position:0%
for this committee to look over these
news

02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
news
 
02:40:59.550 --> 02:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
articles can we can we have them Absolut
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
I only have one copy so that's why I
 
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
brought them for you we don't want to
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
take your only copy but we no you can if
 
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's for us that would be great yes
 
02:41:11.950 --> 02:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely um I know how to find them uh
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
back online so I could resurrect him
 
02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
again so um I'm really praying that this
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
committee passes this
 
02:41:22.479 --> 02:41:23.990 align:start position:0%
committee passes this
resolution

02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to make a huge difference now
 
02:41:29.750 --> 02:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh for New Hampshire residents that work
 
02:41:32.670 --> 02:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
at the shipyard because the cost of real
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
estate I couldn't afford to live in
 
02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth now if I wanted to I'm lucky
 
02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
I bought my house 20 years ago but 25
 
02:41:42.910 --> 02:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
now but that little extra well not
 
02:41:45.710 --> 02:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
little but that thousands of dollars
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
extra those new hires and those people
 
02:41:50.309 --> 02:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
that are just living paycheck to
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
paycheck that money can help them out
 
02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
instead of going to Maine where it
 
02:41:58.030 --> 02:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything for them understand
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
what you what you've said about the uh
 
02:42:04.990 --> 02:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
the taxes and the money um anything else
 
02:42:07.389 --> 02:42:07.399 align:start position:0%
um no I'm open to any questions that
 
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
this committee has are there any
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:42:14.070 --> 02:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
Bennett thank you for taking my question
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little unclear as to was it at
 
02:42:20.110 --> 02:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
what point point you said it was
 
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
somebody somewhere just changed it
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily so do you have a time where
 
02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
it was the Portsmith Naval Shipyard and
 
02:42:31.349 --> 02:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
then when it changed like I can't
 
02:42:33.710 --> 02:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
imagine that many people waking up one
 
02:42:35.389 --> 02:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
day and oh the address has changed and
 
02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a problem can you explain a
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
little bit more about that process so
 
02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
what I understood happened is a com trol
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
for the shipyard who happened to live in
 
02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
Maine realized hey uh the shipyard made
 
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
the decision himself or herself I don't
 
02:42:55.110 --> 02:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
know hey uh you know uh it's in Maine
 
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
they got to cross a bridge to get here
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's a main so they're not paying main
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
income taxes and he started this person
 
02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
started changing all those
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
PDS from portsman Naval Shipyard and the
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
duty station to kidy Maine then all of a
 
02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
sudden the form the government form had
 
02:43:22.269 --> 02:43:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:25.389 --> 02:43:25.399 align:start position:0%
taxes good history there and also it's
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
interesting what Joe B Barton pointed
 
02:43:30.230 --> 02:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
out is it was sluggish there's all these
 
02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
different PDS you might have a secretary
 
02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
you might have an engineer you might
 
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
have this and that it took quite a while
 
02:43:39.469 --> 02:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
for them to slowly change the
 
02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork but it was originally portsman
 
02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
Nao Shipyard for Duty station and Duty
 
02:43:50.030 --> 02:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
location for a long long time wouth not
 
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
KY Naval Station correct other questions
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
see representative mandle
 
02:44:01.150 --> 02:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
bomb thank you Mr chairman um so Mr ster
 
02:44:02.910 --> 02:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
um have you spoken with anyone at the
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
Port SM Naval Shipyard about this bill
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
and gotten their their their view on it
 
02:44:11.590 --> 02:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
I have not spoken to Porta Shipyard
 
02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
about this bill but I will say one thing
 
02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
why does the federal government
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
care okay the reason why I say that is
 
02:44:23.469 --> 02:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
because apparently if you're in a
 
02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
leadership position and you happen to
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
live in Maine you do care because they
 
02:44:30.309 --> 02:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
feel that they're going to have to pay
 
02:44:32.349 --> 02:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
higher main income taxes if they lose
 
02:44:32.359 --> 02:44:33.670 align:start position:0%
higher main income taxes if they lose
the

02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you so they even though the
 
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
main budget is huge they're afraid of
 
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
maybe having to pay a dollar or two
 
02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
extra taxes that they don't have
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
to as a granted stator I like your math
 
02:44:50.469 --> 02:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
and uh and I I think uh Ron manam asked
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
a good question um and we'll have some
 
02:44:55.110 --> 02:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
time to do some research on our own
 
02:44:58.429 --> 02:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
before we EXA this uh my gut feeling U
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
is a resolution that's kind of pro New
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would would find favor here
 
02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
but uh I don't want to get ahead of
 
02:45:08.590 --> 02:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
myself other questions seeing No Hands
 
02:45:12.870 --> 02:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir Mr s and with that I will
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh end the hearing
 
02:45:19.230 --> 02:45:19.240 align:start position:0%

if I'm ready to I will take as many
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman I apologize there
 
03:40:12.910 --> 03:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh people are often nervous when they uh
 
03:40:15.870 --> 03:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
when they testify as we all know
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of things what I'm
 
03:40:19.469 --> 03:40:19.479 align:start position:0%
hearing from you is that the current the
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
latest government in Bangladesh is a
 
03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
fundamentalist would you say they're a
 
03:40:26.910 --> 03:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
theocracy uh a
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
fundamentalist uh theocracy in the sense
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
of like Iran is a theocracy is is that
 
03:40:34.510 --> 03:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
fair to say is that
 
03:40:36.670 --> 03:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
accurate that's a great question Mr
 
03:40:39.389 --> 03:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
chairman so let me explain to you so
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
when this fundamentalist student
 
03:40:45.750 --> 03:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
Uprising happened and the most of them
 
03:40:50.590 --> 03:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
came from madrasas in in Late July and
 
03:40:53.110 --> 03:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
early August they are all madrasa
 
03:40:55.110 --> 03:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
student you know what is madrasha means
 
03:40:59.030 --> 03:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
right that's a institution col schools
 
03:41:03.550 --> 03:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
and colleges teaches Islamic you know
 
03:41:06.870 --> 03:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
ideas and you know things teachings they
 
03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
all came from those madas and they
 
03:41:12.389 --> 03:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
overthrow the duly elected
 
03:41:16.670 --> 03:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
government and it was big uprising and
 
03:41:18.269 --> 03:41:18.279 align:start position:0%
government could not do anything a lot
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
of people died and in the process also
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
and they put a interm government with
 
03:41:28.389 --> 03:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
the um uh Chief
 
03:41:32.429 --> 03:41:32.439 align:start position:0%
advisor who his name is Dr yunus and
 
03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
then they have a bunch of advisers and
 
03:41:37.710 --> 03:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
Dr yunus was in
 
03:41:41.429 --> 03:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
overseas he's a u and he came to you
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
know they brought him in put him on the
 
03:41:46.110 --> 03:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
chief advisor and all all other advisers
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
are fundamentalist Islamic
 
03:41:50.750 --> 03:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
fundamentalist they're related to all
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
the uh band organization called jamat
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
Islam and other Islamic organization
 
03:41:58.510 --> 03:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
that they are banned in United State and
 
03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
other countries so at this time the
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
price of product in people are in very
 
03:42:07.149 --> 03:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
bad shape you know the they could not
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
control they are not controlling
 
03:42:11.269 --> 03:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
anything there is no Law and Order
 
03:42:15.830 --> 03:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
people are uh facing all kind of
 
03:42:18.189 --> 03:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
bad things happening to them you know in
 
03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.990 --> 03:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
5th thank you representative just a
 
03:42:27.670 --> 03:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of context so when you were
 
03:42:30.670 --> 03:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
born uh your country at that time was
 
03:42:34.590 --> 03:42:34.600 align:start position:0%
East Pakistan correct no Mr Mr chairman
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
I was born yes you are right I was born
 
03:42:41.550 --> 03:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
in 1960 it was East Pakistan 1971 is
 
03:42:44.830 --> 03:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
when there was a there was a so so where
 
03:42:47.550 --> 03:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
were you were born now Bangladesh was
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
then East Pakistan you're right and the
 
03:42:56.110 --> 03:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
uh so not everybody perhaps remembers
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm old enough to remember that that war
 
03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
so in 1971 East Pakistan uh basically
 
03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
seceded left the country of Pakistan and
 
03:43:11.070 --> 03:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
became Bangladesh correct in 1971 so Mr
 
03:43:12.910 --> 03:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
chairman if I may explain a little bit
 
03:43:14.670 --> 03:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
more yeah please that would be great for
 
03:43:16.389 --> 03:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
us toar
 
03:43:19.590 --> 03:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
so when the India divided in
 
03:43:23.229 --> 03:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
1947 or you know maybe 1949 I cannot
 
03:43:27.750 --> 03:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
exactly so the India divided it became
 
03:43:31.710 --> 03:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
India today's India and then Pakistan
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
and Pakistan divided two but it's one
 
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
country East Pakistan and West Pakistan
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
and uh they had a geographical uh
 
03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
differences about 1,000 miles in between
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
East and West Pakistan but it was one
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
government so we were we had problem
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
with the West Pakistan because they are
 
03:43:57.269 --> 03:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
holding the power and everything so we
 
03:43:59.710 --> 03:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
went to Freedom fight in
 
03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
1971 and with the help of
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
India uh within 9 months we became uh
 
03:44:09.229 --> 03:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
independent country it was a lot of
 
03:44:11.950 --> 03:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
Bloodshed about 3 million people died
 
03:44:14.070 --> 03:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's about 30 million people went to
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
India as a refugee Refugee and many of
 
03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
you remember that U the The Beatles had
 
03:44:23.710 --> 03:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
a concert in New York in a men Square
 
03:44:25.590 --> 03:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
Garden and you know many things happen
 
03:44:25.600 --> 03:44:26.389 align:start position:0%
Garden and you know many things happen
in

03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
1971 since then you know we have
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
different government different you know
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
things still it was not like today's
 
03:44:36.750 --> 03:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
fundamentalism you know it was a popular
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
government was not some government was
 
03:44:41.710 --> 03:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
not popular and many some government has
 
03:44:44.710 --> 03:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
a full democracy some government didn't
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
had have democracy and all kind of
 
03:44:49.389 --> 03:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
things in underdeveloped countries like
 
03:44:52.590 --> 03:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
any other underdeveloped countries but
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
now is the things that were you know is
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
going in a different direction that
 
03:44:57.960 --> 03:44:59.030 align:start position:0%
going in a different direction that
Islamic

03:44:59.030 --> 03:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
Islamic
 
03:45:02.910 --> 03:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
fundamentalism is the main thing in the
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
government is it fair to say that before
 
03:45:08.149 --> 03:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
this recent regime
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%

03:45:15.630 --> 03:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
measure of uh of Tolerance uh religious
 
03:45:17.950 --> 03:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
tolerance religious freedom is it is
 
03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
that fair to say there was more there
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
was some measure of religious freedom
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
before the regime change is that

relation with
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
India this government is to anti- India
 
03:47:19.990 --> 03:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
because the Hindus are the majority in
 
03:47:23.910 --> 03:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
India that's why they are up mean after
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
Hindus you know in Bangladesh because
 
03:47:28.030 --> 03:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
the India doesn't support this
 
03:47:30.429 --> 03:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
government this inter government and
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
this fake government so it can go all
 
03:47:37.630 --> 03:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
different ways it can you know send all
 
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
kind it can create many many terrorist
 
03:47:43.469 --> 03:47:43.479 align:start position:0%
it can have a refugee problem in again
 
03:47:45.389 --> 03:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
in India a lot of refugee can can go to
 
03:47:48.189 --> 03:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
India and other uh neighboring countries
 
03:47:50.830 --> 03:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
and other many many bad thing can
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
happen thank
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:47:58.189 --> 03:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
Jones well thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:48:03.429 --> 03:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
you representative for being here um
 
03:48:06.030 --> 03:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
question on one word in your bill urg
 
03:48:08.710 --> 03:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
United States government to investigate
 
03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
allegations and why that word
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
allegations cuz that means something
 
03:48:14.149 --> 03:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
allegedly happened wouldn't it be more
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
better to put the word incidence in
 
03:48:23.469 --> 03:48:23.479 align:start position:0%
there uh when we wrote the Bill and when
 
03:48:23.479 --> 03:48:27.990 align:start position:0%
there uh when we wrote the Bill and when
um

03:48:27.990 --> 03:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh I if if the committee would choose to
 
03:48:34.269 --> 03:48:34.279 align:start position:0%
do that I have no problem but I think
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
that uh uh we are at this time the
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
reason I said allegation is I'm we are
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
asking the government to see if it is
 
03:48:46.429 --> 03:48:46.439 align:start position:0%
true so it is for me you know I I wanted
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
to go soft way and you know to
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
accommodate everybody that was the
 
03:48:53.950 --> 03:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
reason I put allegations you know that
 
03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent Jones I point
 
03:49:02.110 --> 03:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
out is you probably all know that once a
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
committee receives a measure a bill or a
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
resolution that the committee can owns
 
03:49:10.229 --> 03:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
that and can amend it so uh we could
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
maybe word Smith that uh I hadn't
 
03:49:15.070 --> 03:49:15.080 align:start position:0%
thought of that but that's a a good a
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
good point other questions
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative from Dunbarton thank you
 
03:49:24.269 --> 03:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks for taking my question
 
03:49:25.469 --> 03:49:25.479 align:start position:0%
um so it's my understanding that
 
03:49:27.349 --> 03:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh is a member of the United
 
03:49:30.510 --> 03:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
Nations has the United Nations addressed
 
03:49:32.990 --> 03:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
this in any form of resolution as far as
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
the atrocities you're describing
 
03:49:37.710 --> 03:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
happening there currently so what I know
 
03:49:40.590 --> 03:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
that United Nations as we speak they are
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
investigating also that what happened to
 
03:49:47.309 --> 03:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
the minority is but many time United
 
03:49:50.870 --> 03:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
Nations in my sense that when they go
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
accompanied by the current government
 
03:49:56.590 --> 03:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
they don't see the real uh picture of it
 
03:49:59.229 --> 03:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
you know like any United Nations
 
03:50:02.229 --> 03:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
investigation we know living in United
 
03:50:05.790 --> 03:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
States it does not go too far you I
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to tell you you all know it
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
does not go far enough to see real
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
picture you know
 
03:50:14.760 --> 03:50:15.990 align:start position:0%
picture you know
follow

03:50:15.990 --> 03:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:50:19.750 --> 03:50:19.760 align:start position:0%

time other
 
03:50:34.590 --> 03:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
questions rep
 
03:50:37.870 --> 03:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
cyber thank you for taking my question
 
03:50:40.630 --> 03:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
um I had a quick um it's just a
 
03:50:42.429 --> 03:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
observation I guess I want to thank
 
03:50:45.070 --> 03:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
everyone for being here um I fully
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
understand I have a lot of ancestors um
 
03:50:50.189 --> 03:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
that came here um you know for the
 
03:50:52.750 --> 03:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of having you know religious
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
freedom um and so you know a lot of them
 
03:50:58.750 --> 03:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
had been you know persecuted and killed
 
03:51:02.149 --> 03:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
and and of that sort so um a little bit
 
03:51:05.149 --> 03:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
of um you know commonality there um I
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
fully agree with this measure um one
 
03:51:09.550 --> 03:51:09.560 align:start position:0%
thing I did want to point out though is
 
03:51:13.110 --> 03:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
just um I understand a lot of um America
 
03:51:15.429 --> 03:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
has a lot of ignorance when does come to
 
03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
Islam sometimes is there a minority um
 
03:51:22.030 --> 03:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
sect of like Islams that are of the
 
03:51:25.229 --> 03:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
Islamic faith that are being persecuted
 
03:51:27.149 --> 03:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
as well since it's obviously more of the
 
03:51:29.630 --> 03:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
fundamentalist side and should we maybe
 
03:51:30.910 --> 03:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
add that
 
03:51:34.590 --> 03:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
in so in my knowledge um I if I
 
03:51:36.590 --> 03:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
understand your question right I think
 
03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying that there is a religious
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
act called sh sh uh I do not heard that
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
they are having any issue with this
 
03:51:52.510 --> 03:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
government or you know um
 
03:51:55.870 --> 03:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
or anything you know I think they they
 
03:51:58.070 --> 03:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
are okay you know in my knowledge I I do
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
not know but everything is going towards
 
03:52:06.070 --> 03:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
Hindus mainly the reason is
 
03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
anti-india you know the the Hindus are
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
the majority population in India and the
 
03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
last government the elected government
 
03:52:17.269 --> 03:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
was very very close friend with India so
 
03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
everything is going towards Hindus and
 
03:52:25.469 --> 03:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
alarming to follow up on representative
 
03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%

03:52:38.229 --> 03:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
they are Shia Sunni are they aligned
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
with the um either of those sects the
 
03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
Shia or Sunni
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%

03:52:56.110 --> 03:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
Saudi Arabian type of uh is
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%

the spirit of Bangladesh Liberation War
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%

history in their own way
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
the current interim government and the
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
press for some reason condone or remain
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
silent on these events we firly believe
 
04:11:25.389 --> 04:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
if this situation continues without any
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
check Bangladesh could become a breeding
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
ground of religious extremism like we
 
04:11:33.790 --> 04:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
saw in
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan the that all on on one
 
04:11:39.389 --> 04:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
account is more than 10 folds since the
 
04:11:41.590 --> 04:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
interim government took power than
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
before the resignation of of the
 
04:11:47.229 --> 04:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
previous government it is really ironic
 
04:11:49.389 --> 04:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
that a recipient of the Nobel Peace
 
04:11:51.870 --> 04:11:51.880 align:start position:0%

04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
government doing everything but
 
04:11:57.990 --> 04:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining peace Law and Order someon
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
raising questions about his sincerity
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
and thinking now is the time to call for
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
revoking his revoking his Nobel Peace
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%

Mr Deb for offering to take questions
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die is something that
 
04:13:08.309 --> 04:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
resonates uh with most of us in this
 
04:13:11.950 --> 04:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
state uh I don't mind having you use
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
that phrase you mention YouTube and
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
Google uh you may or may not know as I
 
04:13:19.229 --> 04:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned to an earlier group uh these
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
proceedings these hearings are are
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
recorded and televised and available on
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
YouTube and okay I think that the case
 
04:13:27.950 --> 04:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
that representative Khan and you are
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
making uh for people that are interested
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
in that uh the uh recording might be of
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
great value my question uh is with
 
04:13:39.750 --> 04:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
regard to the previous leader who you
 
04:13:43.630 --> 04:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
said left on August 9th August uh 5th
 
04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
August 5th okay where where did they go
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
go she went to India okay so she is in
 
04:13:51.710 --> 04:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
India at this time the previous she is
 
04:13:54.830 --> 04:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
India India she got political Asylum not
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
political Asylum she
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
is protected by the Indian government
 
04:14:03.550 --> 04:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
and she is in a secret place because
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
India thinks that this fundamentalist
 
04:14:10.590 --> 04:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
could if she is around and everybody
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
knows where she is staying then it is
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
risk to her life believe me this
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
fundamentalist that are in Bangladesh
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
right now they are helped by the
 
04:14:24.600 --> 04:14:27.309 align:start position:0%
right now they are helped by the
Pakistani

04:14:27.309 --> 04:14:27.319 align:start position:0%
Pakistani
 
04:14:27.319 --> 04:14:28.870 align:start position:0%
Pakistani
isi

04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
isi
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh these are the
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh not they are doing all those things
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
around uh in Afghanistan in Bangladesh
 
04:14:44.149 --> 04:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
in India they are breeding they buing
 
04:14:46.590 --> 04:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
terrorist and sending it to different
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
countries to do all those things so
 
04:14:54.590 --> 04:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
thises the previous leader aspire to
 
04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
return Yes uh she she she she is willing
 
04:15:03.070 --> 04:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
to return and um and most of the analyst
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
think that if India get
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
involved uh which is Bangladeshi interim
 
04:15:12.189 --> 04:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
government or this fundamentalist group
 
04:15:16.349 --> 04:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
they are provoking India to get into
 
04:15:20.590 --> 04:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
war uh the my friend that you know
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there are lot of uh
 
04:15:26.750 --> 04:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
disturbances going along the borders it
 
04:15:30.070 --> 04:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
is intentionally being done the people
 
04:15:32.189 --> 04:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
from Bangladesh they are going inside
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
India cutting their crops and taking it
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
to Bangladesh there are several places
 
04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
maybe miles that there is no uh fences
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
and if the if India wants to put the
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
fence then the people from Bangladesh go
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
there and try to make a problem you know
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
they're they're fighting with the uh
 
04:15:58.149 --> 04:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
border security force of India so we
 
04:16:00.870 --> 04:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that until 1971
 
04:16:05.109 --> 04:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh was East Pakistan which uh no
 
04:16:07.950 --> 04:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
before 19 right right until 1971 it was
 
04:16:11.309 --> 04:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
East Pakistan since 1947 yeah where
 
04:16:13.469 --> 04:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
representative Khan touched on that
 
04:16:17.070 --> 04:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
and in 1971 East Pakistan uh separated
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
from Pakistan and became Bangladesh so
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
my question is what is the posture of
 
04:16:26.550 --> 04:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
Pakistan formerly West Pakistan but
 
04:16:29.550 --> 04:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
Pakistan has Pakistan recognize this new
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
regime it's a it's a it's a very great
 
04:16:36.189 --> 04:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
question because in
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
1971 India helped the Bangladeshi
 
04:16:43.630 --> 04:16:43.640 align:start position:0%
Liberation forces to
 
04:16:46.710 --> 04:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
you know fight the uh Pakistani soldiers
 
04:16:49.469 --> 04:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
that they were staying there for 9
 
04:16:53.070 --> 04:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
months uh India helped us and we got the
 
04:16:53.080 --> 04:16:53.870 align:start position:0%
months uh India helped us and we got the
uh

04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:56.830 --> 04:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
Independence now Pakistan couldn't
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
forget these things and that's why they
 
04:17:04.750 --> 04:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
have been trying to do all those things
 
04:17:07.070 --> 04:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
behind the scene with the
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
Islamic uh parties that were defeated
 
04:17:13.269 --> 04:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want the
 
04:17:15.269 --> 04:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
independence of Bangladesh they wanted
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
to stay with Pakistan this jamaat
 
04:17:20.670 --> 04:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
islami and
 
04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
Pakistan uh secretly was helping them
 
04:17:27.550 --> 04:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
that's our understanding and Pakistan
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
wants to take revenge against the India
 
04:17:35.109 --> 04:17:35.119 align:start position:0%
because they think that India split this
 
04:17:38.149 --> 04:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
country East Pakistan and West Pakistan
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
splitted it for their
 
04:17:44.910 --> 04:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
advantage because if East Pakistan is a
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
separate country bengalis we have same
 
04:17:49.630 --> 04:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
culture West Bengal which is the capital
 
04:17:52.990 --> 04:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
is Kolkata and Daka is the capital of
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
East Pakistan used to be East Pakistan
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
West P East Pakistan and West Bengal of
 
04:18:01.950 --> 04:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
India used to be one
 
04:18:06.910 --> 04:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
state and the British rulers they knew
 
04:18:10.750 --> 04:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
that the bengalis are the very uh
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
Progressive and these kind of people
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
they know if they stay together then it
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
will be a problem so so they divided the
 
04:18:20.670 --> 04:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
Bengal and one become East Bengal the
 
04:18:23.229 --> 04:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
other was West bangal so does Pakistan
 
04:18:25.870 --> 04:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
have diplomatic relations with the new
 
04:18:30.510 --> 04:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
bang they used to yes with old old uh
 
04:18:32.950 --> 04:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
government they used to have but not
 
04:18:37.469 --> 04:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
that way currently Dr unus Professor
 
04:18:39.550 --> 04:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
unus is out of the country he is
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
attending the economic Summit AT Davos
 
04:18:46.830 --> 04:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
Switzerland and there is nobody and we
 
04:18:51.550 --> 04:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
heard the news that the uh chairman of
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
the isi which is a detective branch of
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
Pakistani government uh like you know
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
you can say CIA uh that are visiting
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
Pakistan uh sorry Bangladesh and they
 
04:19:09.149 --> 04:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
are meeting with the military so we are
 
04:19:12.070 --> 04:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
thinking that they are plotting
 
04:19:12.080 --> 04:19:13.389 align:start position:0%
thinking that they are plotting
something

04:19:13.389 --> 04:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
maybe a military coup or something I
 
04:19:17.950 --> 04:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
don't know those kind of things so yes
 
04:19:20.109 --> 04:19:20.119 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
04:19:23.189 --> 04:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
relation which is we don't know how much
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
but uh between isi and this Islamic
 
04:19:29.710 --> 04:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
jihadist parties and groups in
 
04:19:32.469 --> 04:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh okay thank you question other
 
04:19:35.790 --> 04:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Deb uh representative
 
04:19:39.870 --> 04:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
Bennett thank you for taking my question
 
04:19:43.550 --> 04:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
um do you think that there are people
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
or do you know if there are people from
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
coming from your country to America for
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
political Asylum at this time are they
 
04:19:56.189 --> 04:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
able to get out of the country for
 
04:20:00.590 --> 04:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
danger reasons uh I don't know about
 
04:20:04.510 --> 04:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
this but I know that most of the uh many
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the people who had the opportunity
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
you have the opportunity either they
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
have the Visas previous visas from us or
 
04:20:14.429 --> 04:20:14.439 align:start position:0%
from other countries they're living the
 
04:20:16.710 --> 04:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
country for their safety because they
 
04:20:19.309 --> 04:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't see normal people cannot live
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
in the country right now because
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday I saw a video that a a student
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
presumably student came out of a you
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
know taxi and a group of another
 
04:20:39.750 --> 04:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
students was beating him with X and
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
hurting his ankle and knees severely and
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh and he died and he died right in
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
front daylight in the street nobody is
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
going there everybody is avoiding
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
because they think that if they want to
 
04:21:02.550 --> 04:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
stop the people or they go there for
 
04:21:05.950 --> 04:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
help they will be attacked also so
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
nobody a normal person cannot stay there
 
04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
if they have any way to coming like
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
students have visas they are coming out
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
of the country uh or going to Europe to
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
any country or here in the United States
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
but I uh don't know anybody that came
 
04:21:26.790 --> 04:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
here uh after this or due to this and
 
04:21:30.109 --> 04:21:30.119 align:start position:0%
ask for any Asylum no I don't know
 
04:21:32.269 --> 04:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
represent cyber did you have your hand
 
04:21:35.070 --> 04:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
up yeah I just had a quick question um
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
kind of an OB observation but it is a
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
question um so um in I guess the perfect
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
world where and and I really hope this
 
04:21:46.950 --> 04:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
happens truly um to where you guys get
 
04:21:50.109 --> 04:21:50.119 align:start position:0%
your your previous leader back or what
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
you I'm sure you guys probably still
 
04:21:54.269 --> 04:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
consider her Your Leader you recognize
 
04:21:58.630 --> 04:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
this yeah the new corrupt leaders um but
 
04:22:01.710 --> 04:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
um with that said um do you believe it's
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
a better idea and would you in the
 
04:22:08.189 --> 04:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
future then um have a strict policy of
 
04:22:10.990 --> 04:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state so that
 
04:22:13.510 --> 04:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have you know religious
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
institutions maybe running you know
 
04:22:17.950 --> 04:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
state run schools and all that type of
 
04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
thing yeah it's a very good question and
 
04:22:24.990 --> 04:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
this separation of chch and government
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
is it it is possible in this environment
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
in the western world but in our country
 
04:22:35.550 --> 04:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
uh everybody is very religious and we
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
don't have any problem with being
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
religious but it hurts us when religion
 
04:22:46.389 --> 04:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
becomes so you know makes people so
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
fanatic when you become a fanatic you
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
cannot how can you kill a person by
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
beating him with ax on his knees and
 
04:23:00.269 --> 04:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
ankles so that he cannot walk and and he
 
04:23:02.309 --> 04:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
died in we saw in the
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
video last night you know after seeing
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
the video I couldn't sleep I knew that I
 
04:23:10.030 --> 04:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
will come here but I couldn't sleep I
 
04:23:14.870 --> 04:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
was thinking God which country it turned
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
into but under the previous government
 
04:23:21.550 --> 04:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
government tried to make perhaps you
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
know that Bangladesh was doing very good
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
they came out of the third world
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
countries their GDP in most cases was
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
better than India and uh very good and
 
04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
country first world country 20 something
 
04:23:47.469 --> 04:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
she had she had some kind of vision and
 
04:23:49.109 --> 04:23:49.119 align:start position:0%
she was doing
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
everything uh you know the
 
04:23:54.750 --> 04:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure wise she made lot of
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
things that are uh now we can say that
 
04:24:04.109 --> 04:24:04.119 align:start position:0%
uh that we uh can could be in 10 20
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
years like Singapore or something that
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
was her vision but uh these people
 
04:24:16.870 --> 04:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
burned lot of stuff that destroyed all
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
the documents that destroyed the Museum
 
04:24:23.870 --> 04:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
of our Liberation war that destroyed the
 
04:24:26.109 --> 04:24:26.119 align:start position:0%
sculpture that destroyed the statue of
 
04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%

representative buat budhi thank you
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'm just trying to
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
understand um so you are you
 
04:24:57.630 --> 04:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
saying whatever is now happening in
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh about human rights abuses is
 
04:25:03.790 --> 04:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh coming from uh the interim government
 
04:25:06.510 --> 04:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
from Dr yunus Muhammad
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
yunice I don't know whether they from
 
04:25:11.469 --> 04:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
the interim government but interim
 
04:25:16.830 --> 04:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
government is condoning all those things
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
they their partners are this but let me
 
04:25:23.349 --> 04:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
put it this way that his partner he is
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
from gramine Bank his only interest
 
04:25:29.830 --> 04:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
which I see and many of us may see that
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
he was convicted for evading tax from
 
04:25:35.910 --> 04:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
gaming bank and
 
04:25:41.389 --> 04:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
666 cres of Bangladeshi takas was he was
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to give
 
04:25:48.910 --> 04:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
back and uh August 7th or something was
 
04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
the date of that final uh you know
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
um whatever you know conviction and all
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
those things against uh this uh
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
Professor unus but before that August
 
04:26:06.510 --> 04:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
5th they did all those things to so that
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
H and the government can fall government
 
04:26:11.469 --> 04:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
fall and all those things happened a
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
quick followup follow
 
04:26:17.189 --> 04:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
up um so I'm just trying to strengthen
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
you know my thinking here so is it be is
 
04:26:24.349 --> 04:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
it because of the advisers of Dr Unis or
 
04:26:26.469 --> 04:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
entering government all these are
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
happening no I think he is also involved
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
in this it is clear because he was
 
04:26:35.429 --> 04:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
denying that nothing is happening he is
 
04:26:38.590 --> 04:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
not saying if you are a good person you
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
could at least go to the TV and radio
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
channels and tell that please don't do
 
04:26:48.750 --> 04:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
this this is not good you cannot do this
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
he is a recipient of Nobel Peace Prize
 
04:26:56.870 --> 04:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
why he couldn't say those things because
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
he's condoning all those
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
things and he is part of this
 
04:27:05.070 --> 04:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
conspiracy the fall of the government my
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
friend told earlier that he is was uh
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
very aligned with the Clinton Foundation
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
let me point out one thing when he came
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
in last September in New York for this
 
04:27:22.149 --> 04:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
General Assembly meeting he made a
 
04:27:25.109 --> 04:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
meeting with Clinton foundation and you
 
04:27:27.429 --> 04:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
can see it it is in YouTube he
 
04:27:31.389 --> 04:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
introduced this Maul Alam there is one
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
person is his advisor as he told
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
President Clinton that this is the
 
04:27:41.710 --> 04:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
person he designed he did a meticulous
 
04:27:41.720 --> 04:27:42.910 align:start position:0%
person he designed he did a meticulous
design

04:27:42.910 --> 04:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
design
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that previous government didn't know who
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
is the student
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
leader and doing all those things and
 
04:27:56.670 --> 04:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
and and and it was clear that it was the
 
04:27:56.680 --> 04:27:58.429 align:start position:0%
and and and it was clear that it was the
this

04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
um uh Revolution or this Uprising was
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
pre-planned and some people and somebody
 
04:28:09.630 --> 04:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
maybe some invisible government was
 
04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
helping them and the student
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
protest was just a PL just just
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
something that it's a sincere and it was
 
04:28:24.870 --> 04:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
government was didn't know that is a
 
04:28:24.880 --> 04:28:26.590 align:start position:0%
government was didn't know that is a
student

04:28:26.590 --> 04:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
Uprising but after everything was made
 
04:28:32.030 --> 04:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
from their
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
demand they started to say that okay now
 
04:28:38.309 --> 04:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
we want the fall of the we don't want
 
04:28:40.910 --> 04:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
this government because they killed us
 
04:28:42.870 --> 04:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
04:28:45.469 --> 04:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
whoever was killed they were not killed
 
04:28:48.030 --> 04:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.910 --> 04:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
police the I don't know how this
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
jihadist got the arms because all the
 
04:28:59.429 --> 04:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
bullets that HD the students and they
 
04:29:05.109 --> 04:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
died was never used by police in
 
04:29:08.189 --> 04:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh the police Bangladeshi police
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
didn't use those bullets and these
 
04:29:13.590 --> 04:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
bullets came from somewhere so we think
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
that they infiltrated in the police and
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
they used
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
these weapons coming from
 
04:29:24.269 --> 04:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere and killed the students so
 
04:29:26.950 --> 04:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
that they get the people's support
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
because they were killing you killed so
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
many people so we don't want this
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
government so we don't know where the
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
arms came from we don't know where they
 
04:29:38.229 --> 04:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
from and it's the proof proof is there
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
and interim government is not doing
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
anything about this is not saying

1947 when he got freedom from British
 
04:48:26.310 --> 04:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
rules it wasn't
 
04:48:32.670 --> 04:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
Pakistan it was Hindu India and Muslim
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
India that's why we separated from our
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
own people like a bengoli
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
Bengal is a ethnic group it's not
 
04:48:46.868 --> 04:48:46.878 align:start position:0%
Bangladeshi or not
 
04:48:50.830 --> 04:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
Indian it's a group it's it's the
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
identity as a Bengali but we are
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
separated from our own identity as a
 
04:49:04.110 --> 04:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
Bangladeshi like East Pakistan after
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
1971 because I work with minority in
 
04:49:08.240 --> 04:49:09.708 align:start position:0%
1971 because I work with minority in
hilre

04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
hilre
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
area and I know in my own
 
04:49:19.390 --> 04:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
experience even my oldest brother his
 
04:49:22.510 --> 04:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
name is now Peter
 
04:49:28.590 --> 04:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
S so when he converted from Islam to
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
Christianity lots of people come to kill
 
04:49:35.708 --> 04:49:35.718 align:start position:0%
him because this is their holy work to
 
04:49:35.718 --> 04:49:36.750 align:start position:0%
him because this is their holy work to
kill

04:49:36.750 --> 04:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
kill
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
him there be in heaven if someone
 
04:49:45.868 --> 04:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
kill him this is their believing Faith
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
you cannot erase the faith because this
 
04:49:50.548 --> 04:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
in your
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
heart not in
 
04:49:53.760 --> 04:49:55.788 align:start position:0%
heart not in
outside

outside
 
04:49:59.110 --> 04:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
so the someone says like the
 
04:50:05.708 --> 04:50:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.070 --> 04:50:09.080 align:start position:0%

property any minority or Hindu or
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
Christian or Buddhist they left the
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
country from
 
04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh if they go back after 10
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
years or 5 years they're not getting
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
nothing it's to be automatically by
 
04:52:15.150 --> 04:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
constitutionally enemy
 
04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.190 --> 04:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing No Hands uh I want to
 
04:52:25.750 --> 04:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again for coming here I know
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
you had to drive a little ways and I
 
04:52:29.830 --> 04:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
want to thank uh everyone representative
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
Khan that you had come in here those who
 
04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
spoke and those who did not uh speaking
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
only for myself my awareness has been
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
very much raised I want to think I track
 
04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the world and I I
 
04:52:43.270 --> 04:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
honestly did not know much about what's
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
happening I'm very concerned glad you
 
04:52:47.070 --> 04:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
brought this forward I can't say what's
 
04:52:50.788 --> 04:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
going to happen with the resolution hr11
 
04:52:52.750 --> 04:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
the uh committee will have to take it up
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
in exec session and and obviously have a
 
04:52:56.990 --> 04:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
vote on it uh I already said if it does
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
move forward uh I think you'd be a
 
04:53:01.030 --> 04:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful person to speak to it more so
 
04:53:04.548 --> 04:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
than probably most of us so uh we will
 
04:53:07.310 --> 04:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
possibly get to this to execute a week
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
from today and then um we'll go from
 
04:53:13.390 --> 04:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
there so it with that I
 
04:53:16.868 --> 04:53:16.878 align:start position:0%
will close the hearing on hr11 and we
 
04:53:18.548 --> 04:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
have one more measure today we're a
 
04:53:21.390 --> 04:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
little bit behind but
 
04:53:24.110 --> 04:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:53:27.868 --> 04:53:27.878 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I'm sure understands that
 
04:53:30.350 --> 04:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh we want to let folks finish
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
their finish what they need to uh share
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
with us
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh so our final measure of the day uh
 
04:53:42.390 --> 04:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
house concurrent resolution hcr9 this
 
04:53:43.990 --> 04:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
would go to the Senate if it gets to the
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
house uh a resolution urging the United
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
States to reject reject compliance with
 
04:53:52.350 --> 04:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
the European Union's corporate
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
sustainability due diligence directive
 
04:53:59.390 --> 04:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I'll be frank I I'm not really up on
 
04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
the European Union's corporate
 
04:54:04.270 --> 04:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
sustainability due diligence directive
 
04:54:06.030 --> 04:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative but I'm sure you'll
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
explain that to us very interested so U
 
04:54:11.948 --> 04:54:11.958 align:start position:0%
have at it well thank you chairman M and
 
04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee and yes that's uh my goal uh
 
04:54:17.430 --> 04:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm representative JD
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
Bernardi Rockingham 36 which is I live
 
04:54:22.910 --> 04:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
in Southampton but also represent
 
04:54:25.830 --> 04:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
Kensington Hampton Falls Newton and
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
plasto uh so uh with this is to
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
introduce H uh hcr9 which urges the US
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
to reject compliance with the
 
04:54:40.430 --> 04:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
European corporate sustainability due to
 
04:54:43.030 --> 04:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
diligence directive uh which is a
 
04:54:45.910 --> 04:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
directive designed to transform business
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
practices across the entire world
 
04:54:53.390 --> 04:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
including the US so this directive was
 
04:54:57.390 --> 04:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
passed last July it becomes effective
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
this July and with the way the European
 
04:55:05.628 --> 04:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
rules work the national governments have
 
04:55:09.470 --> 04:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
to translate and put the directive into
 
04:55:14.788 --> 04:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
their own National laws by July of 26
 
04:55:16.590 --> 04:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
and then it becomes
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
effective uh for corporate compliance in
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
July of 27 so this is we're still in a
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
timely mode here um
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:55:33.270 --> 04:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
ccdd mandates that large businesses
 
04:55:36.350 --> 04:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
impose ESG standards on companies
 
04:55:38.830 --> 04:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
operating within their quote unquote
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
chain of activities regardless of
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
whether that chain business has
 
04:55:46.190 --> 04:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
operations within the European union now
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
what does that mean well first off large
 
04:55:51.750 --> 04:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
businesses are defined as those with a
 
04:55:51.760 --> 04:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
businesses are defined as those with a
th000

04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
th000
 
04:55:55.910 --> 04:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
employees and
 
04:56:01.510 --> 04:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
450 uh million euros in uh uh net
 
04:56:04.750 --> 04:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
revenue that translates to about 500
 
04:56:09.390 --> 04:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
million Us in revenue and that would
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
essentially mean
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
about 6,000 companies within
 
04:56:17.910 --> 04:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
Europe but a th000 non-european
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
companies so what does this chain of
 
04:56:23.910 --> 04:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
activities mean that means all your
 
04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
supply chain also gets swept into the
 
04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
mix so let's say you're a Ford Motor
 
04:56:33.230 --> 04:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
Company you're likely to be one of those
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
1,000 us companies selling some product
 
04:56:36.320 --> 04:56:37.510 align:start position:0%
1,000 us companies selling some product
in

04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
Europe well the windshield wipers
 
04:56:43.030 --> 04:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
the red tail lights on the back of the
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
car the uh the the knobs on the radio
 
04:56:49.590 --> 04:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
probably aren't made by Ford they're
 
04:56:54.548 --> 04:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
made by some supplier so those companies
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
also get swept into to the entire
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements of this
 
04:57:05.788 --> 04:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
directive so what are those uh goals or
 
04:57:08.510 --> 04:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
standards so that the European standards
 
04:57:11.230 --> 04:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
on unions and Collective bargaining
 
04:57:13.948 --> 04:57:13.958 align:start position:0%
health care and disease prevention
 
04:57:13.958 --> 04:57:15.390 align:start position:0%
health care and disease prevention
children's

04:57:15.390 --> 04:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
children's
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
education a full transition to a green
 
04:57:18.360 --> 04:57:19.510 align:start position:0%
education a full transition to a green
energy

04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:57:22.350 --> 04:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
economy requirements for climate
 
04:57:25.430 --> 04:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
transition plans in each
 
04:57:28.990 --> 04:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
Corporation reductions in water and land
 
04:57:32.830 --> 04:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
usage social justice provisions and bans
 
04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
on any
 
04:57:37.868 --> 04:57:37.878 align:start position:0%
disinformation so this is a full
 
04:57:43.110 --> 04:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
implementation of ESG Dei Paris Accord
 
04:57:46.910 --> 04:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
etc etc etc all written into into the
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
law so businesses that failed to meet
 
04:57:55.190 --> 04:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
these standards by their actions and
 
04:57:57.990 --> 04:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
Reporting will face Financial penalties
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
of not less than 5% of their net
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
worldwide they call it turnover but it's
 
04:58:04.638 --> 04:58:05.470 align:start position:0%
worldwide they call it turnover but it's
it's

04:58:05.470 --> 04:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:58:08.670 --> 04:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
essentially uh annual revenue so if
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're $100 million in sales and you
 
04:58:15.190 --> 04:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
miss compliance here you're paying a $5
 
04:58:18.750 --> 04:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
million fine that
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
year so in addition to the financial
 
04:58:24.470 --> 04:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
sanctions the bill or the directive
 
04:58:27.070 --> 04:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
authorizes activists groups and
 
04:58:30.670 --> 04:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
individuals to also be able to sue the
 
04:58:35.670 --> 04:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:39.510 --> 04:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
damages and if a if a covered company uh
 
04:58:42.110 --> 04:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
business Partners do not adhere to the
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
mandates the cover covered companies
 
04:58:47.708 --> 04:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
must end their business relationships so
 
04:58:50.070 --> 04:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
that is cut off your
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
suppliers or face penalties or cease
 
04:58:55.150 --> 04:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
operating in the European Union so
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
that's the ultimate threat is you you
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
don't get to operate within the
 
04:59:03.868 --> 04:59:03.878 align:start position:0%
EU uh beyond the beyond all these
 
04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
Financial um
 
04:59:09.230 --> 04:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
fines so this is likely to cause a
 
04:59:12.030 --> 04:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
massive wealth transfer from the
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
developing to the from developed
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
countries to developing
 
04:59:20.350 --> 04:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
countries uh as as because the
 
04:59:25.510 --> 04:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
law also says that large companies have
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
to provide targeted and proportional
 
04:59:31.510 --> 04:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
support for their small and medium-sized
 
04:59:35.230 --> 04:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
business partners or suppliers that have
 
04:59:36.990 --> 04:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty complying with all these
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
standards so again let's go back to Ford
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
if Ford is buying windshield wipers and
 
04:59:45.270 --> 04:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer happens to be in
 
04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
Malaysia they're going to have to go to
 
04:59:50.270 --> 04:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
work with the Malaysian company to get
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
them up to compliance uh so no matter
 
04:59:57.548 --> 04:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
where these suppliers are coming from us
 
04:59:57.558 --> 04:59:59.628 align:start position:0%
where these suppliers are coming from us
or

04:59:59.628 --> 04:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:00:02.830 --> 05:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so the bottom line is if this
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
goes unaddressed by America we
 
05:00:09.628 --> 05:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
effectively become a vassel state to the
 
05:00:12.510 --> 05:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
Europe Union and fundamentally
 
05:00:15.548 --> 05:00:15.558 align:start position:0%
transformed through corporate
 
05:00:15.558 --> 05:00:17.110 align:start position:0%
transformed through corporate
coercion

05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
05:00:20.548 --> 05:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
now the current Trump Administration has
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
addressed many of these issues on a
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
government scale they are not addressed
 
05:00:27.320 --> 05:00:28.948 align:start position:0%
government scale they are not addressed
for

05:00:28.948 --> 05:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
businesses the Biden Administration when
 
05:00:34.430 --> 05:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
this law was passed by the
 
05:00:37.350 --> 05:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
Europeans uh indicated their support
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to stand in the way
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:44.910 --> 05:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
as I see it if we this resolution goes
 
05:00:48.670 --> 05:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
forward it will essentially uh tickle
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
the uh Trump Administration probably
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
through the Secretary of State's office
 
05:00:57.070 --> 05:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
to advise Europe we are not going to
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
comply and if you want compliance if
 
05:01:02.430 --> 05:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to demand compliance maybe
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
05:01:06.670 --> 05:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
tariffs maybe there's going to be other
 
05:01:09.510 --> 05:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
sanctions like increase your fees to
 
05:01:12.910 --> 05:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
Nato maybe there's going to be uh
 
05:01:15.270 --> 05:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
disruptions in supplies of American
 
05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
Goods that are necessary for European
 
05:01:19.830 --> 05:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
life I don't know that's going to be up
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State in those
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
discussions with the European countries
 
05:01:28.030 --> 05:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
but uh the bottom line is uh I believe
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's important for America to send
 
05:01:35.910 --> 05:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
a message to Europe we are not going to
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
comply and you're not going to force
 
05:01:42.390 --> 05:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
American companies to comply with these
 
05:01:45.310 --> 05:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
extremist European laws happy to answer
 
05:01:45.320 --> 05:01:46.190 align:start position:0%
extremist European laws happy to answer
any

05:01:46.190 --> 05:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative uh I
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
know there are some questions uh before
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
I go to representative mandal bomb uh so
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
you see the EU csdd is threatening us
 
05:02:00.510 --> 05:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
sovereignty yes through essentially
 
05:02:02.670 --> 05:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
corporate coercion making our companies
 
05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
comply with their laws which is going to
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
change how we do business here how long
 
05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
ago is this measure passed and by the EU
 
05:02:12.910 --> 05:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
you it was passed in July of of last
 
05:02:12.920 --> 05:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
you it was passed in July of of last
year

05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:02:18.270 --> 05:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
2024 and it becomes effective through
 
05:02:21.510 --> 05:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
their system of how they do directives
 
05:02:25.390 --> 05:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
in July of this year and then it has to
 
05:02:28.548 --> 05:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
be translated into all the national laws
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
of each of the 26 member states in by
 
05:02:35.430 --> 05:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
July of
 
05:02:38.910 --> 05:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
2026 and then it becomes effective
 
05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
operationally for compliance purposes in
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
July of
 
05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
2027 thank you uh representative Mandel
 
05:02:48.510 --> 05:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
bomb uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:02:50.708 --> 05:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi I'm looking at
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
the American buyer association's website
 
05:02:55.548 --> 05:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
and they say quote the due diligence
 
05:02:57.910 --> 05:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
dtive will ultimately apply to all us
 
05:02:59.868 --> 05:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
companies having the annual group-wide
 
05:03:02.708 --> 05:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
revenue from the EU Market of over 450
 
05:03:06.270 --> 05:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
million um Euros which is about $472
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
million today regardless of whether they
 
05:03:10.548 --> 05:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
have any subsidiaries or branches in the
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
EU I'm
 
05:03:16.190 --> 05:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
wondering how many US multinational
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
companies would fall into that category
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
of having group-wide revenue of over 450
 
05:03:25.868 --> 05:03:25.878 align:start position:0%
million euros
 
05:03:29.590 --> 05:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah so the the estimated number is
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
about a th000 American companies and
 
05:03:36.590 --> 05:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
6,000 European companies but again
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's the large companies and it also
 
05:03:42.670 --> 05:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
sweeps in all those suppliers so that
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
little supplier making that little red
 
05:03:46.948 --> 05:03:46.958 align:start position:0%
tailight in the back of your car you
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
know they may have uh a $3
 
05:03:54.590 --> 05:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
million a year uh company they're going
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
to be swept into so that's why the ABA
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
is saying this is going to Encompass the
 
05:04:04.350 --> 05:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
most of the US
 
05:04:07.350 --> 05:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
economy representative
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
F thank you so um I did read the uh the
 
05:04:17.310 --> 05:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
csdd um I would urge my fellow committee
 
05:04:20.150 --> 05:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
members to do so as well there's some
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's the whole thing and then there's
 
05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
very concise information available um so
 
05:04:29.030 --> 05:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is applies to private companies
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
doing business in the European Union so
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
is the goal here to for the government
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
to tell private businesses not to comply
 
05:04:42.310 --> 05:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
because I mean this is on the businesses
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
to advance their to comply or to you
 
05:04:51.070 --> 05:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
know cease doing business in the EU so
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
is your goal for the United States to
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
direct all applicable businesses not to
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
comply with this
 
05:05:00.628 --> 05:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
directive if an American Business wanted
 
05:05:03.708 --> 05:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
to comply with this type of directive on
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
their own valtion you know that's their
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
business however uh this
 
05:05:14.430 --> 05:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
particular uh resolution is to have the
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
US government tell European authorities
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
we you cannot mandate
 
05:05:24.628 --> 05:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
your vision of how companies should
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.990 --> 05:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
States follow
 
05:05:34.590 --> 05:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
up but
 
05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
you so I mean it is essentially of Their
 
05:05:42.750 --> 05:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
Own ition they have the option to uh you
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
know they could pay these fees or they
 
05:05:47.948 --> 05:05:47.958 align:start position:0%
could not do business in the European
 
05:05:51.150 --> 05:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
Union but uh you don't think that it's
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
the right of the EU to determine what
 
05:05:58.030 --> 05:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
kind of companies are allowed to do
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
business or for any um you know body
 
05:06:05.470 --> 05:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
like the United States for example you
 
05:06:07.430 --> 05:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that the United States is
 
05:06:09.990 --> 05:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to set regulations for what kind
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
of companies are allowed to do business
 
05:06:16.990 --> 05:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
here uh this bill doesn't do anything
 
05:06:19.708 --> 05:06:19.718 align:start position:0%
about setting requirements for us
 
05:06:23.350 --> 05:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
businesses doing business in Europe we
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
essentially have a uh a a a capitalist
 
05:06:30.990 --> 05:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
country where we have regulations on
 
05:06:36.910 --> 05:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
safety and and um uh uh those types of
 
05:06:40.350 --> 05:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
things but this is this is policy
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
directives that are well beyond the
 
05:06:46.270 --> 05:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
normal scope of doing business so again
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
if a company is in favor of these kinds
 
05:06:52.990 --> 05:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
of uh activities they can sign up and
 
05:06:55.708 --> 05:06:55.718 align:start position:0%
they can run ESG programs on their own
 
05:06:58.190 --> 05:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
and Dei programs they can do whatever
 
05:07:00.310 --> 05:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
they want or they can or or or
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
essentially what this what this uh
 
05:07:05.670 --> 05:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
European law says if you don't want to
 
05:07:08.030 --> 05:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
comply with those kind of things and you
 
05:07:10.190 --> 05:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
don't like it you can't can't do any
 
05:07:13.030 --> 05:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
business here well you
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
know I don't I don't think that's
 
05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate I'm Mr chairman I just have
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
another followup sure thank you um so it
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like from what you just said that
 
05:07:28.390 --> 05:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
your issue is more with the substance of
 
05:07:33.510 --> 05:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
the directive but uh if it's uh low or
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a body to set
 
05:07:39.030 --> 05:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
regulations in general for the kinds of
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
companies that are allowed to operate
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
within that uh that body why is that not
 
05:07:47.638 --> 05:07:50.830 align:start position:0%
within that uh that body why is that not
corporate

05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:55.470 --> 05:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
coercion I okay the the way most of our
 
05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory structures work uh is is we
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
we come up with agreements like and we
 
05:08:08.190 --> 05:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
have uh un or a similar uh
 
05:08:11.590 --> 05:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
um or organizations that will set these
 
05:08:13.990 --> 05:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
are the rules of the road that we're
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
going to use internationally for air
 
05:08:17.948 --> 05:08:17.958 align:start position:0%
traffic these are the rules of the road
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to use for transporting
 
05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
packages these are the rules of the road
 
05:08:26.350 --> 05:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
that we're going to use safety wise for
 
05:08:31.150 --> 05:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh nuclear materials whatever so we have
 
05:08:36.470 --> 05:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
a system that that has worked in where
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
all comp uh countries get together and
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
and agree on standards of how they're
 
05:08:43.948 --> 05:08:43.958 align:start position:0%
going to do business this is the
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
European Union saying the heck with the
 
05:08:48.750 --> 05:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the world you're going to do it
 
05:08:51.788 --> 05:08:51.798 align:start position:0%
our way and that's
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
unacceptable other questions
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative Hemingway thank you Mr
 
05:08:58.390 --> 05:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative taking
 
05:09:00.030 --> 05:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:09:03.150 --> 05:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
so I did I did some research on
 
05:09:06.590 --> 05:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
this probably last year year before as
 
05:09:07.868 --> 05:09:07.878 align:start position:0%
this was
 
05:09:10.430 --> 05:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
developing so BAS Bally essentially my
 
05:09:12.628 --> 05:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
understanding of this ESG uh which is
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
environmental social and governance um
 
05:09:16.990 --> 05:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
so this is going to be the standard for
 
05:09:18.628 --> 05:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
determining whether a business can do
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
business with another person or another
 
05:09:24.750 --> 05:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
entity um the problem with that is that
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
if you don't comply with ESG standards a
 
05:09:30.110 --> 05:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
company will not be able to get a loan
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
correct correct uh and uh as I continue
 
05:09:38.750 --> 05:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um here we go yeah the so in
 
05:09:40.110 --> 05:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
a sense
 
05:09:42.510 --> 05:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
a bank a financial institution or
 
05:09:44.310 --> 05:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
another manufacturer could determine who
 
05:09:46.030 --> 05:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
they want to do business with which they
 
05:09:48.670 --> 05:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
can do anyway but they would have to
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
follow ESG those three those three thing
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
things that if they were not environment
 
05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
environmentally sound and and didn't do
 
05:09:58.670 --> 05:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
things to protect their environment they
 
05:10:01.510 --> 05:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
weren't socially uh inclusive of of all
 
05:10:05.350 --> 05:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
the organizations and the governance of
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
of uh fair and Equity uh I think it was
 
05:10:10.830 --> 05:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
was like
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh pay managers pay and and you know uh
 
05:10:18.548 --> 05:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
equal pay equal work equal everything so
 
05:10:21.990 --> 05:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
those items and if I if I've looked
 
05:10:24.270 --> 05:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
further in
 
05:10:28.270 --> 05:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
Japan uh China they are already doing
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
this on a lower scale to the people
 
05:10:36.070 --> 05:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
there they are not able to if you don't
 
05:10:38.390 --> 05:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
follow those those guidance they're not
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
able to get a loan for a house or or
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
their job is in Jeopardy because they're
 
05:10:45.548 --> 05:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
not following those rules is that
 
05:10:48.750 --> 05:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct if in China if
 
05:10:50.910 --> 05:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
you don't follow the rules you you don't
 
05:10:53.470 --> 05:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
get to buy the bus token to drive to get
 
05:10:56.910 --> 05:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
to work I I mean it's it's that simple I
 
05:10:59.310 --> 05:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
mean it's control
 
05:11:03.190 --> 05:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism uh an ultimate control
 
05:11:06.430 --> 05:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism representative Hemingway so
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
kudos for doing some Advanced due
 
05:11:10.590 --> 05:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
diligence uh you may have positioned
 
05:11:12.510 --> 05:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
yourself to do a committee report I
 
05:11:15.750 --> 05:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't know uh but uh good on you for
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
that um this screams for Commerce
 
05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
Committee uh as I look at this language
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh th the folks in Commerce I think
 
05:11:26.190 --> 05:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
would uh drill down and have questions
 
05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
similar to what representative Hemingway
 
05:11:30.110 --> 05:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
has already asked uh but we we tend to
 
05:11:31.830 --> 05:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
do resolutions here and this is a
 
05:11:31.840 --> 05:11:32.910 align:start position:0%
do resolutions here and this is a
certainly

05:11:32.910 --> 05:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
resolution um a concurrent resolution my
 
05:11:37.948 --> 05:11:37.958 align:start position:0%
question are you concerned about
 
05:11:41.310 --> 05:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
retaliation if if uh if
 
05:11:46.470 --> 05:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
the desire of this resolution were to be
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
put into practice by the current
 
05:11:51.990 --> 05:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
Administration uh and I think you
 
05:11:54.110 --> 05:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned tariffs we hearing a lot about
 
05:11:56.910 --> 05:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
tariffs uh are you concerned about
 
05:11:59.470 --> 05:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
retaliation by the EU if if we move
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
forward with this type of
 
05:12:04.910 --> 05:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
resistance well I I I think our response
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
would be perceived as retaliation to
 
05:12:09.390 --> 05:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do to us they
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
struck first with this and and if we say
 
05:12:18.910 --> 05:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
no you know yeah we th this we either
 
05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
get down on our knees and comply or we
 
05:12:26.150 --> 05:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
say no and you know we're we're going to
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
get into a heated discussion on what the
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
consequences of this kind of activity
 
05:12:33.000 --> 05:12:35.030 align:start position:0%
consequences of this kind of activity
are

05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
um yes I mean that's that's where this
 
05:12:41.230 --> 05:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:42.868 --> 05:12:42.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
cyber um I have um two I have two small
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
questions but I think the first one
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
really is based off of you know first of
 
05:12:54.510 --> 05:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
all how is this different from the
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
tariffs that are on the table right now
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
for us to force other countries
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
essentially to
 
05:13:04.750 --> 05:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
pay for in products being
 
05:13:09.590 --> 05:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
I guess um it would it be con I mean to
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
me that would be just as much a coercion
 
05:13:16.190 --> 05:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
as this would
 
05:13:19.990 --> 05:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
be well I think uh where I've heard
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
discussions of tariffs is against Mexico
 
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
and China for you know let's you stop
 
05:13:27.868 --> 05:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
your drug trade stop your fentel
 
05:13:30.548 --> 05:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
processing coming in or you know there's
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to be compliance there's going to
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
be retaliation that way against your
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
government so in those types of
 
05:13:40.628 --> 05:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
situations we're defining an ill that
 
05:13:43.270 --> 05:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
we're saying we want you to stop and if
 
05:13:45.548 --> 05:13:45.558 align:start position:0%
you don't we're going to put a tariff on
 
05:13:48.590 --> 05:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
you this you could say this is this is
 
05:13:52.830 --> 05:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
similar but uh uh it hasn't started yet
 
05:13:56.708 --> 05:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
this is going to happen if we don't bow
 
05:13:59.948 --> 05:13:59.958 align:start position:0%
down and in additionally have all our
 
05:14:03.230 --> 05:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
large companies sweep in all our small
 
05:14:05.708 --> 05:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
suppliers to to do this kind of
 
05:14:05.718 --> 05:14:07.230 align:start position:0%
suppliers to to do this kind of
compliance

05:14:07.230 --> 05:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
work just my one extra question sure
 
05:14:12.868 --> 05:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
thank you um the one other one thing I
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to say was in regards to um cuz I
 
05:14:18.910 --> 05:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
I kind of wanted to piggy back off what
 
05:14:22.868 --> 05:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
Lily had said before in regards to um
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
the so it seems like though we're
 
05:14:28.548 --> 05:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
entering into this or just agreeing with
 
05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
this or whatever it's a compliance
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
situation allowing for companies to make
 
05:14:37.350 --> 05:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
compliance if we repeal this companies
 
05:14:39.788 --> 05:14:39.798 align:start position:0%
who still want to do business
 
05:14:41.708 --> 05:14:41.718 align:start position:0%
that qualify for it that still want to
 
05:14:44.110 --> 05:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
do business with the EU or you know some
 
05:14:46.510 --> 05:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
we might have that already are
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
previously complying now might not be
 
05:14:51.868 --> 05:14:51.878 align:start position:0%
able to do that because we're not
 
05:14:53.670 --> 05:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
entering into this agreement I mean
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's what it looks like to me no no no
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
if corporations can conduct business
 
05:15:03.270 --> 05:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
however they want to if they want to
 
05:15:06.030 --> 05:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
employ ESG Dei standards and whatnot
 
05:15:10.390 --> 05:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
they want to have uh a a vast amount of
 
05:15:16.030 --> 05:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh compliance with uh Green New Deal
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
technology if that's what they want as
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
part of how they're going to run their
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
business they can do that on their own
 
05:15:25.750 --> 05:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
and they're not forbidden for from
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
having any conducting business in in
 
05:15:31.430 --> 05:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
Europe what what the European law says
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
is if you don't comply with our vision
 
05:15:38.110 --> 05:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
of those items you can't do business in
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
Europe or we're going to find the heck
 
05:15:44.310 --> 05:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
you represent Manion thank you Mr chair
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so uh when
 
05:15:51.590 --> 05:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're talking about like the smaller uh
 
05:15:53.070 --> 05:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that may be providing to
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
the larger International corporations it
 
05:15:57.628 --> 05:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
could be that this ends up being a um
 
05:15:59.948 --> 05:15:59.958 align:start position:0%
would you would you would you agree that
 
05:16:01.948 --> 05:16:01.958 align:start position:0%
it's picking winners and losers where
 
05:16:03.470 --> 05:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
the smaller companies that could not
 
05:16:05.150 --> 05:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
compete to meet these regulatory
 
05:16:06.868 --> 05:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
standards would just go entirely out of
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
business and the only things left would
 
05:16:10.510 --> 05:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
be molter International corporations
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's possible it's going to force uh
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know compliance in that direction so
 
05:16:18.590 --> 05:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
if they can't if if a smaller uh company
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
can't comply and they don't get the
 
05:16:23.070 --> 05:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
quote unquote help that they're supposed
 
05:16:26.590 --> 05:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
to from the large corporation by this uh
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
directive yeah their their Market size
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
would shrink and potentially that could
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
force them out of
 
05:16:37.510 --> 05:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
business representative Mandel bom thank
 
05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um
 
05:16:41.470 --> 05:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to understand what
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
the core issue is is it about the
 
05:16:50.670 --> 05:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
csdd having the ability to sue companies
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
for alleged damages or is it more about
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
what this law is
 
05:16:59.708 --> 05:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
asking potentially us you know
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations to do like is
 
05:17:05.628 --> 05:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
it about this specific actions that
 
05:17:07.868 --> 05:17:07.878 align:start position:0%
they're asking for well the directive
 
05:17:09.590 --> 05:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
basically says if you want to do
 
05:17:13.190 --> 05:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
business in Europe you must comply so so
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a doing business issue and if
 
05:17:18.390 --> 05:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
you still do business in Europe or try
 
05:17:20.590 --> 05:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
to do business in Europe and don't
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
comply you will be fined and and
 
05:17:27.390 --> 05:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately if you don't comply then we
 
05:17:30.430 --> 05:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
will shut the door you can't come
 
05:17:35.150 --> 05:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
in follow up thank you Mr chairman
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
so is this just to clarify is this about
 
05:17:41.910 --> 05:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
the issue of compliance in general or
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
Are there specific things that this law
 
05:17:47.868 --> 05:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
is mandating that you're opposed to it's
 
05:17:50.548 --> 05:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
it's compliance with the package of
 
05:17:53.230 --> 05:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
requirements that they've they've
 
05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
embedded in the directive I summarize
 
05:17:57.750 --> 05:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
them there but if you go into the
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
directive this is a large laundry list
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
and some of them you know you may say
 
05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
hey this is great I I'm I'm all for you
 
05:18:07.470 --> 05:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
know this and others of them you'd say
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
no I don't and it's inappropriate for
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
the Europeans to pick the policies that
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
us Corporation should be adopting it's
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
up to us corporations to do that you
 
05:18:24.830 --> 05:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
know they're when they make a product
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.548 --> 05:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
rep representative
 
05:18:37.150 --> 05:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman see if I get
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
what they're proposing the EU is my way
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
or the highway is that correct I would
 
05:18:53.390 --> 05:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
say that's a nice shorthand okay follow
 
05:18:56.590 --> 05:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
up follow up not withstanding that we
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
bailed them out twice in the last
 
05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
century could it also be said that you
 
05:19:05.670 --> 05:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
want to play that game we can play that
 
05:19:08.510 --> 05:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
game you guys pay for all your defenses
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
from from now on how's that that as I
 
05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
indicated I would expect if the US
 
05:19:20.350 --> 05:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
government Secretary of State's office
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
agrees that this is inappropriate to
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
force this kind of compliance on us
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
companies they can they have several
 
05:19:30.750 --> 05:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
arrows in the quiver one could be
 
05:19:33.310 --> 05:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
tariffs one could be you're paying for
 
05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
all of NATO or we're we're leaving uh or
 
05:19:42.070 --> 05:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh you need certain special components
 
05:19:44.390 --> 05:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
that are only made and manufactured in
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
the US we're not selling them to you you
 
05:19:50.548 --> 05:19:50.558 align:start position:0%
know we can we can play a counter game
 
05:19:53.628 --> 05:19:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:57.070 --> 05:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
that represent man uh thanks for taking
 
05:19:59.070 --> 05:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
my question uh the outcome of all of
 
05:20:01.470 --> 05:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
this would be increased prices on the
 
05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
end consumer you would you say that if
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
if this continues yes
 
05:20:10.750 --> 05:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
my my guess
 
05:20:15.628 --> 05:20:15.638 align:start position:0%
is a solid posture against this by the
 
05:20:17.948 --> 05:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
United States is going to force the
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
European Union to re address this
 
05:20:24.030 --> 05:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
directive it barely passed I mean if you
 
05:20:27.310 --> 05:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
follow the European Politics on this
 
05:20:30.190 --> 05:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
issue those in power in the European
 
05:20:33.910 --> 05:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
Parliament when this passed tended to
 
05:20:37.270 --> 05:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
be strongly on the
 
05:20:40.750 --> 05:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
left they saw the elections were
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
swinging against them they expected that
 
05:20:47.110 --> 05:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the next round of elections they
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
would be losing many seats so they
 
05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
basically said if we're going to do this
 
05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
now the European parliament's changing
 
05:21:04.030 --> 05:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
and the European Parliament could very
 
05:21:04.040 --> 05:21:05.868 align:start position:0%
and the European Parliament could very
well

05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:21:08.948 --> 05:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know renig on this change changed
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
this law there's many particularly in
 
05:21:14.590 --> 05:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
the Eastern block uh of of the European
 
05:21:16.990 --> 05:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
Union the polands the Czech republics
 
05:21:19.708 --> 05:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
and whatnot I just said we don't like
 
05:21:21.910 --> 05:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
this at all and they voted very strongly
 
05:21:21.920 --> 05:21:24.110 align:start position:0%
this at all and they voted very strongly
against

05:21:24.110 --> 05:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:21:27.310 --> 05:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
it uh representative Bernardi you
 
05:21:29.150 --> 05:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
anticipated my qu you already answered
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
the question I was going to ask and that
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
had to do with how agile how Nimble is
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
the EU in terms of changing course so
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
you ahead of me in this obviously ahead
 
05:21:42.510 --> 05:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
of most of us so you said this passed
 
05:21:45.548 --> 05:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
narrowly so do you know or perhaps
 
05:21:47.190 --> 05:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
someone perhaps repres of Hemingway
 
05:21:52.750 --> 05:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
knows I do you know um what the uh what
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
the process is or or the timeline for
 
05:21:57.910 --> 05:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
change because I know as you said the
 
05:22:02.590 --> 05:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
eu's uh makeup is is changing U how soon
 
05:22:04.788 --> 05:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
could they make a change or do you
 
05:22:07.910 --> 05:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
know well in the next in the next
 
05:22:09.390 --> 05:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
Parliament they could bring up a
 
05:22:13.070 --> 05:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
resolution and and to change compliance
 
05:22:14.670 --> 05:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
with us they could say they could change
 
05:22:16.350 --> 05:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
the compliance say oh we're going to
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
keep this but it's only going to apply
 
05:22:21.868 --> 05:22:21.878 align:start position:0%
to European companies okay then we have
 
05:22:25.628 --> 05:22:25.638 align:start position:0%
no no problem right it's when they want
 
05:22:29.548 --> 05:22:29.558 align:start position:0%
to make it comply to the world they want
 
05:22:32.590 --> 05:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
to rule the world you know that that's
 
05:22:36.628 --> 05:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
that's the issue so uh but timing wise
 
05:22:36.638 --> 05:22:38.548 align:start position:0%
that's the issue so uh but timing wise
um

05:22:38.548 --> 05:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
the next parliaments are is is are are
 
05:22:43.750 --> 05:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
starting to meet now you know the same
 
05:22:47.310 --> 05:22:47.320 align:start position:0%
as same as our
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
Congress so representative Bernard are
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
you looking to interfere in EU Affairs
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh quite clearly I'm I'm asking the
 
05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
United States to tell Europe you cannot
 
05:23:01.310 --> 05:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
tell our companies how to
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
operate okay other questions
 
05:23:03.440 --> 05:23:04.430 align:start position:0%
operate okay other questions
representative

05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:08.948 --> 05:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
F oh yes um so it's
 
05:23:11.670 --> 05:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's not specifically us companies it's
 
05:23:14.830 --> 05:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
any companies across the world that have
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
more than 150 or 450 million euros in
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
Revenue coming from the European Union
 
05:23:24.030 --> 05:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's not targeted I just
 
05:23:27.390 --> 05:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
don't understand how is it appropriate
 
05:23:32.030 --> 05:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
for the US government to interfere
 
05:23:34.670 --> 05:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
with private
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's the other way around it's
 
05:23:45.990 --> 05:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for the European
 
05:23:48.430 --> 05:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to interfere with American
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
companies or any international company
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
for that matter but I I'm mostly
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
concerned with American
 
05:23:58.110 --> 05:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
companies followup followup uh but
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's not what this law is doing this
 
05:24:03.948 --> 05:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
would insert the US government into
 
05:24:06.868 --> 05:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
these relationships between private
 
05:24:11.070 --> 05:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
businesses and the European Union no
 
05:24:14.070 --> 05:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
this directive asked the US government
 
05:24:17.230 --> 05:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
to tell the European authorities we
 
05:24:19.708 --> 05:24:19.718 align:start position:0%
don't want you mandating these
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:27.430 --> 05:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
businesses representative Lloyd thank
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
my question um so I guess my concern
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
here would be a a precedent um being
 
05:24:39.190 --> 05:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
broken or being set where are you at all
 
05:24:41.590 --> 05:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about what this might mean if
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
the US has a specific regulation or
 
05:24:47.310 --> 05:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
requirement to operate businesses for
 
05:24:50.190 --> 05:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
for foreign um com foreign companies
 
05:24:52.270 --> 05:24:52.280 align:start position:0%
foreign owned companies to have
 
05:24:55.788 --> 05:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
businesses here what that would mean for
 
05:24:57.628 --> 05:24:57.638 align:start position:0%
those businesses because we may have
 
05:25:00.830 --> 05:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
more strict or stringent requirements or
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
regulations where another organization
 
05:25:03.280 --> 05:25:07.190 align:start position:0%
regulations where another organization
does

05:25:07.190 --> 05:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:09.750 --> 05:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
not uh okay I'm trying I'm trying to get
 
05:25:13.548 --> 05:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around that so again most
 
05:25:13.558 --> 05:25:15.708 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around that so again most
of

05:25:15.708 --> 05:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh international trade is are the you
 
05:25:22.788 --> 05:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
know the practices are governed by uh by
 
05:25:22.798 --> 05:25:24.070 align:start position:0%
know the practices are governed by uh by
in

05:25:24.070 --> 05:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
by various commissions and committees L
 
05:25:29.350 --> 05:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
often times under the under the
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
supervision of the UN setting ultimate
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
standards I mean I could see if the
 
05:25:35.830 --> 05:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
United States
 
05:25:39.110 --> 05:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
says uh we are no long longer going to
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
accept any productss in the United
 
05:25:43.150 --> 05:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
States made with slave
 
05:25:45.750 --> 05:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
labor you know that would be interfering
 
05:25:48.270 --> 05:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
with the business practices of China
 
05:25:51.590 --> 05:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would but should we and could we do
 
05:25:54.510 --> 05:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
that yes we can so if that's a if that's
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
an unacceptable precedent I I would
 
05:25:56.878 --> 05:25:59.430 align:start position:0%
an unacceptable precedent I I would
accept

05:25:59.430 --> 05:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
that representative fos um well speaking
 
05:26:06.510 --> 05:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
of precedent how is this different than
 
05:26:09.310 --> 05:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
the uh Tick Tock band which was just
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
held as constitutional by the Supreme
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
Court is that
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
not another example of the US already
 
05:26:19.750 --> 05:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
having set
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
regulations first off there wasn't a Tik
 
05:26:25.708 --> 05:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
Tock ban what there was was a
 
05:26:29.230 --> 05:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that Tik tock not be owned
 
05:26:32.670 --> 05:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
by the Communist Party of
 
05:26:35.830 --> 05:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
China the ownership structure of Tik
 
05:26:40.948 --> 05:26:40.958 align:start position:0%
tock goes straight back to the CCP so
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
the the ban was Tik Tock you can operate
 
05:26:47.830 --> 05:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
but you have to divest your ownership
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
from the CCP so that's what's going on
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
in fact the the ability to operate now
 
05:26:56.910 --> 05:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
has been extended to allow the company
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
to find a a an an ownership structure
 
05:27:04.190 --> 05:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
that's not tied to the Communist
 
05:27:07.830 --> 05:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
Party followup followup um to be clear I
 
05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
was using Tik Tok band colloquially I'm
 
05:27:14.230 --> 05:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with the law um so bik dance
 
05:27:15.788 --> 05:27:15.798 align:start position:0%
the owner of Tik Tok was given the
 
05:27:20.110 --> 05:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
option of selling to a US company how is
 
05:27:22.030 --> 05:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
that different than companies being
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
given the option of complying with this
 
05:27:30.030 --> 05:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
existing law or not doing business in
 
05:27:31.150 --> 05:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
the United
 
05:27:33.548 --> 05:27:33.558 align:start position:0%
States or not doing business in the
 
05:27:36.190 --> 05:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
European Union not doing business in the
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
United States is obviously what happened
 
05:27:41.390 --> 05:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
with this law for bite
 
05:27:44.430 --> 05:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
dance I I think the issue is what are
 
05:27:47.830 --> 05:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
the standards and so the US is is is and
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
every country can do this uh you set
 
05:27:53.948 --> 05:27:53.958 align:start position:0%
standards of minimum compliance that you
 
05:27:59.070 --> 05:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
want to see in in uh in Commerce so we
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
set a standard that we don't want uh
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
social media companies to be owned by
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
the Communist Party of China that's the
 
05:28:07.680 --> 05:28:08.708 align:start position:0%
the Communist Party of China that's the
standard

05:28:08.708 --> 05:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
standard
 
05:28:12.708 --> 05:28:12.718 align:start position:0%
so the Europeans Set uh a massive number
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
of Standards uh many of which uh most of
 
05:28:20.948 --> 05:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
the United States populations finds
 
05:28:23.510 --> 05:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
disagreeable and sent that message loud
 
05:28:25.150 --> 05:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
and clear in the last
 
05:28:25.160 --> 05:28:26.830 align:start position:0%
and clear in the last
election

05:28:26.830 --> 05:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
election
 
05:28:26.840 --> 05:28:28.628 align:start position:0%
election
uh

05:28:28.628 --> 05:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
so I mean I think I think that's the
 
05:28:31.120 --> 05:28:33.868 align:start position:0%
so I mean I think I think that's the
fundamental

05:28:33.868 --> 05:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
05:28:37.830 --> 05:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
issue so up so you said when you started
 
05:28:39.670 --> 05:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
out your answer though that a country
 
05:28:44.628 --> 05:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
has the ability to set
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
requirements so it sounds like you agree
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
that the European Union has the the
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
right to set requirements I absolutely
 
05:28:55.030 --> 05:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
agree they can set these standards and
 
05:28:58.190 --> 05:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
they can they can say eventually uh
 
05:29:00.788 --> 05:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
we're not going to uh you know allow any
 
05:29:03.628 --> 05:29:03.638 align:start position:0%
American companies to uh do business
 
05:29:06.310 --> 05:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
here they can do that they can close
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:14.948 --> 05:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
right does anyone else have any a hand
 
05:29:16.830 --> 05:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
up before I go back to representative F
 
05:29:19.868 --> 05:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:25.350 --> 05:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
fair yeah I I'm turning you you have the
 
05:29:27.590 --> 05:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
same question you said or oh maybe not I
 
05:29:29.070 --> 05:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm
 
05:29:32.070 --> 05:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
following uh go ahead rip some
 
05:29:36.548 --> 05:29:36.558 align:start position:0%
F Well um if you agree that it's fine
 
05:29:39.628 --> 05:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
for businesses and for for the EU to do
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
that what's the issue the
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
standards so just to call it spade a
 
05:29:50.548 --> 05:29:50.558 align:start position:0%
spade your issue is with the
 
05:29:53.070 --> 05:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
ideological bent of the
 
05:29:56.750 --> 05:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
standards if the European Union passed a
 
05:29:59.350 --> 05:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
directive saying we are not going to
 
05:30:01.868 --> 05:30:01.878 align:start position:0%
accept any products made with slave
 
05:30:04.990 --> 05:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
labor I don't think I or most of the
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
people in the United States would have
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
any concern with that but if
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
passed this directive which has a vast
 
05:30:15.910 --> 05:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
list of Standards many of
 
05:30:18.708 --> 05:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
which most people in the United States
 
05:30:21.708 --> 05:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
do not agree with yes I do have an issue
 
05:30:21.718 --> 05:30:23.230 align:start position:0%
do not agree with yes I do have an issue
with

05:30:23.230 --> 05:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:30:25.350 --> 05:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
that representative mandal bomb did you
 
05:30:27.788 --> 05:30:27.798 align:start position:0%
want to ask something um well I did just
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
kind of want to want to build on
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative F's question and a
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
question I had asked earlier which I
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
feel like I received a contradictory
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
answer to so which pieces of this law
 
05:30:46.110 --> 05:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
objectionable pieces of the the the core
 
05:30:51.788 --> 05:30:51.798 align:start position:0%
of the directive goes to the standards
 
05:30:54.110 --> 05:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
that the Europeans are trying to impose
 
05:30:58.548 --> 05:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
on all companies of size so it is that
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
laundry list of
 
05:31:02.830 --> 05:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
Standards I mean I the some of them I
 
05:31:04.670 --> 05:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
can go down the list and say oh that's
 
05:31:07.510 --> 05:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
nice and I have no issue with that but
 
05:31:11.110 --> 05:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
the real issue is in aggregate that list
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
is an unacceptable
 
05:31:16.070 --> 05:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
list the current Administration has
 
05:31:19.868 --> 05:31:19.878 align:start position:0%
already said many of the things that are
 
05:31:22.270 --> 05:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
identified there are unacceptable and
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
are not going to be done in the US
 
05:31:27.990 --> 05:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
government anymore yet the Europeans are
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
trying to back door into United States
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
through this this compliance
 
05:31:35.110 --> 05:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
requirements on
 
05:31:37.270 --> 05:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
corporations that's what I'm object
 
05:31:39.628 --> 05:31:39.638 align:start position:0%
objecting to
 
05:31:41.590 --> 05:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
so that goes back to my initial question
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
right up front about sovereignty you see
 
05:31:45.470 --> 05:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
this as a sovereignty issue it is a
 
05:31:47.470 --> 05:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
sovereignty issue yes okay other
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
05:31:51.910 --> 05:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
Lloyd thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:31:55.708 --> 05:31:55.718 align:start position:0%
you again for taking my question um so I
 
05:31:58.948 --> 05:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
guess are you aware of this being a
 
05:32:02.590 --> 05:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
capitalist Society um are you aware of
 
05:32:04.510 --> 05:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
the most recent reports that show that
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
corporate uh sustainability is actually
 
05:32:12.708 --> 05:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:15.350 --> 05:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
businesses I'm I'm not aware of any
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
particular report on that I would say
 
05:32:21.708 --> 05:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
yes sustainability is always you know a
 
05:32:24.470 --> 05:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
good thing you want your company to to
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh continue on but defining what the
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
issues are to ensure sustainability I
 
05:32:33.910 --> 05:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
think there's tremendous differences of
 
05:32:36.628 --> 05:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
opinion on what those what constitutes
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
that that those
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
standards I see hand representative
 
05:32:44.230 --> 05:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
mandal B uh thank you Mr chairman um I
 
05:32:46.510 --> 05:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
have a question and then a request if I
 
05:32:50.110 --> 05:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
may so I'm I just I'm struggling with
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
the idea that members of the European
 
05:32:55.470 --> 05:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
Union are not allowed to set their own
 
05:32:58.868 --> 05:32:58.878 align:start position:0%
standards they are so then what's the
 
05:33:00.548 --> 05:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
concern they're saying these are the
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
standards we're talking about private
 
05:33:04.150 --> 05:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
businesses they
 
05:33:07.390 --> 05:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
can you know choose to engage with that
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
or not not and I mean you you brought up
 
05:33:13.230 --> 05:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
the example that if we were to say that
 
05:33:15.788 --> 05:33:15.798 align:start position:0%
we are not going to import any Goods
 
05:33:17.708 --> 05:33:17.718 align:start position:0%
produced with slave
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
labor why is that more acceptable than
 
05:33:25.548 --> 05:33:25.558 align:start position:0%
for instance saying that we you know the
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
European union doesn't want any Goods
 
05:33:29.510 --> 05:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
that are produced in places that don't
 
05:33:31.788 --> 05:33:31.798 align:start position:0%
have safe working conditions or or
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
reasonal limitation of working
 
05:33:37.910 --> 05:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
hours that's not what this does that's
 
05:33:39.708 --> 05:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at it right now that may
 
05:33:43.310 --> 05:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
be one and as I indicated there in in
 
05:33:46.548 --> 05:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
that large basket of Standards you may
 
05:33:48.948 --> 05:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
look at some of them and say yeah I that
 
05:33:50.590 --> 05:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
one that one's a good one let's pick
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
that good one out and no it's it's it's
 
05:33:58.510 --> 05:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
the entire basket is you have to comply
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
with and there are many items in there
 
05:34:03.708 --> 05:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
that are unacceptable and the American
 
05:34:06.670 --> 05:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
people don't agree with so the Europeans
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
can set the requirements for European
 
05:34:12.110 --> 05:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
companies to comply with that that's
 
05:34:16.350 --> 05:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
fine but they don't have the right well
 
05:34:18.350 --> 05:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
they they do have the right to tell us
 
05:34:20.150 --> 05:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
that if we want to do business there but
 
05:34:21.548 --> 05:34:21.558 align:start position:0%
we have the right to say we're not going
 
05:34:24.670 --> 05:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
to do it that's the Counterpoint right I
 
05:34:26.270 --> 05:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what representative
 
05:34:28.430 --> 05:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
fos was saying there's a choice there um
 
05:34:30.430 --> 05:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
and that's the purpose of the resolution
 
05:34:34.150 --> 05:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
is for us to say we don't agree with
 
05:34:36.910 --> 05:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
your basket of Standards we are not
 
05:34:39.750 --> 05:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
going to require American companies to
 
05:34:41.948 --> 05:34:41.958 align:start position:0%
do that and if you are going to take
 
05:34:44.430 --> 05:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
action against American companies you
 
05:34:46.948 --> 05:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
can expect counter action against
 
05:34:50.350 --> 05:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
European companies and European uh
 
05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
governments for that kind of
 
05:34:56.948 --> 05:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
behavior what you just said I think
 
05:34:59.190 --> 05:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
captures what you're trying to do very
 
05:35:01.310 --> 05:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
well that that was well stated I'm
 
05:35:03.948 --> 05:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
starting to get it better repr manal Bon
 
05:35:05.628 --> 05:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up sure um I just had
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
a followup so
 
05:35:07.920 --> 05:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
a followup so
[Music]

05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm struggling a bit with this
 
05:35:15.670 --> 05:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
idea it's the package but you know
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
countries can put in standards that they
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
want and I just
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
um I would so this is more of a
 
05:35:25.190 --> 05:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
statement or a request than a question
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
but I would find it useful if you could
 
05:35:30.590 --> 05:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
go through this list of conditions and
 
05:35:33.590 --> 05:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
Mark which ones you find acceptable and
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
and which ones you think the the US
 
05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:42.270 --> 05:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
I that's that's a large task that's a
 
05:35:45.910 --> 05:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
big list uh so I
 
05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
mean I can tell
 
05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
you there's some of them right away that
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
I have absolutely no agreement with um
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
Europeans shouldn't be setting Union uh
 
05:35:59.948 --> 05:35:59.958 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining requirements for
 
05:36:01.390 --> 05:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
the for the United States they shouldn't
 
05:36:05.070 --> 05:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
be requiring ESG and Dei requirements
 
05:36:06.910 --> 05:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
and our current Administration has said
 
05:36:08.868 --> 05:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do that in the
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
government already that is already a
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
policy of the United States on a
 
05:36:16.548 --> 05:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
government level
 
05:36:19.190 --> 05:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
so why the Europeans should be able to
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
force that on us
 
05:36:25.948 --> 05:36:25.958 align:start position:0%
companies doesn't make any sense so
 
05:36:28.990 --> 05:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
those those are three right off the
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
top other questions representative
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
benett thank you for um letting me ask a
 
05:36:38.708 --> 05:36:38.718 align:start position:0%
question question so I'm going to chime
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
in here um I'm thinking
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
about uh this whole
 
05:36:50.030 --> 05:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
thing as you said um in the recent we
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
did have recently voted and so if we
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
complied with this do you think that
 
05:37:02.190 --> 05:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot of companies that
 
05:37:04.670 --> 05:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
might uh have
 
05:37:08.948 --> 05:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
employees that would say if you do this
 
05:37:10.670 --> 05:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're not going to work for your company
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
anymore do you think Americans would
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
have that resolve after all we've been
 
05:37:19.270 --> 05:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
through or do you think they just just
 
05:37:21.070 --> 05:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do it because they want to
 
05:37:26.030 --> 05:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:29.310 --> 05:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
paycheck well some yeah that's a mixed
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
bag I mean some some people you when
 
05:37:35.948 --> 05:37:35.958 align:start position:0%
they were certain requirements came into
 
05:37:38.470 --> 05:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
the I guess the
 
05:37:40.230 --> 05:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get an example in my head and
 
05:37:44.708 --> 05:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
so the so if in in the covid era Thou
 
05:37:47.430 --> 05:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
shalt take the the jab or not if you
 
05:37:50.190 --> 05:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
want to work here right so there were
 
05:37:52.230 --> 05:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
people that said no I'm not going to do
 
05:37:54.670 --> 05:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
it and they've had to leave the
 
05:37:57.270 --> 05:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
company uh there are some companies
 
05:37:59.628 --> 05:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
where had enough people stand up and say
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
no and the company changes the
 
05:38:06.110 --> 05:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
policy it's it it yes the answer is yes
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:10.798 --> 05:38:12.750 align:start position:0%
 
other

05:38:12.750 --> 05:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:38:15.470 --> 05:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I have no other
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
pink cards I I wish there was uh another
 
05:38:20.150 --> 05:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
one more pink card to someone to speak
 
05:38:23.150 --> 05:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
against we have to play the role of uh
 
05:38:24.910 --> 05:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
in the absence of uh anybody else
 
05:38:27.510 --> 05:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
