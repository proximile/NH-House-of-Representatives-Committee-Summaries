00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and it's a relative to the placement
 
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
of telecommunication antenna and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
I will say that we've had a couple of
 
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
meetings before and the President Bill
 
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
as it was introduced is not going to
 
00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
happen but the purpose of this
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is to determine very simply
 
00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the purpose of this
 
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting here is to
 
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not we will
 
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
recommend to the full committee if there
 
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
should be further legislative
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
legislative action to be done that does
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
that does not necessarily mean that it
 
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
would say that we recommend passage of
 
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
the current bill it does not necessarily
 
00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 align:start position:0%
mean that we would be recommending a
 
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
specific Bill to be put into the current
 
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
system it merely says that we feel some
 
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
type of legislative action of some
 
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.570 align:start position:0%
type of legislative action of some

subject
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
is recommended to be put forth at some
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
time in the future it would be up to the
 
00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
full committee to decide how they want
 
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
to vote on that recommendation or the
 
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
subcommittee could recommend that we
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
don't feel there is a need for further
 
00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
legislative action and we could proceed
 
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
with that recommended recommendation to
 
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
the full committee as well
 
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
with that being said I'd like to
 
00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 align:start position:0%
introduce the subcommittee members that
 
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 align:start position:0%

representative Kelly Pitts
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
myself and representative white is on
 
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee but he's not present
 
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 align:start position:0%
these are the members that would be
 
00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
voting on our recommendation today
 
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
those are the only people that are
 
00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 align:start position:0%
assigned to the subcommittee as as
 
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
voting members
 
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
um with that being said I've had a
 
00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
request from representative abrami to
 
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 align:start position:0%
make a a few minute statement so
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
of course I appreciate being a
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
non-voting member on this panel I
 
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and uh appreciate that
 
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
that you allowed us to do not zoom but
 
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.129 align:start position:0%
that you allowed us to do not zoom but
uh

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
what are we doing
 
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
teams teams uh to uh to bring in some
 
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
other additional voices that we didn't
 
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
hear from in the prior meetings that
 
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
we've had on this
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
and uh Mike obviously my goal is to keep
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
this alive not necessarily in the form
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
that it was to build I agreeing I
 
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
understand that bill is gone
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh the 1644 but to keep the whole
 
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
concept in the discussion of of not
 
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
necessary 5G
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
but RF radiation is what we're talking
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
about here so uh with that I I uh we
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
have three three new voices Theodore
 
00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 align:start position:0%
Theodora scarato
 
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
who'll talk to us about what
 
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities are doing and it's the
 
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
first handout that you see the glossy
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
one that she'll be speaking from
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
and then uh and uh what what what's
 
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
going on in municipalities and what's
 
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
going on with other research Susan
 
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
Foster I don't know if she's on yet uh
 
00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 align:start position:0%
who's who was involved with the
 
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
California firefighters years ago
 
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh and she'll explain what happened
 
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.629 align:start position:0%
uh and she'll explain what happened
there

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
and and Scott
 
00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
um McAuliffe uh who's uh who's an
 
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
attorney who's been looking at these
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
issues for for many years
 
00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
and then we'll wrap up with CeCe
 
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 align:start position:0%
Doucette uh who you've heard from before
 
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh uh but who's going to talk about our
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
education because I think the the chair
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
asked me last week what kind of
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
legislation would you be thinking about
 
00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 align:start position:0%
and one and representative Kelly Pitts
 
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
had already suggested maybe legislation
 
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
related to RF education
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
which we certainly will probably try to
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
file a bill there
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
but the other was is how do we Empower
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
our municipalities to have some
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
additional say in the whole issue of
 
00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
placement of towers in their communities
 
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
so they're trying to make it more of a
 
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
local thing and so those are those are
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
the two areas that we're thinking now of
 
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
legislation for next year
 
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
that would come under the heading of
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
basically RF radiation so uh with that I
 
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr chair and we'll go
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
from there
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative abrami I
 
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
would like to add that in addition
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
um representative lewicki is here and
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
he's going to offer a few words uh on
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
his ideas involving frequency that he
 
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
feels uh hasn't been spoken about enough
 
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
and at some point in time we'll
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
introduce him to to have a say on that
 
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
if there's anybody else here who came
 
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
here to prepare something of a brief
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
statement I would need to have their
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
names brought up here so I can call on
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
them if not we would just proceed with a
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
discussion and uh my aim is to God is to
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
be out of here before 12 noon or sooner
 
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
so uh we have your
 
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.110 align:start position:0%
so uh we have your
picture

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
thank you I will try to alter if I can I
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
understand we are on a telecast here
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
called teams
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to be in this room
 
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.850 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to be in this room
um

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
issues I know that you're familiar by
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
now with our lawsuit against the FCC
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
where we challenged their decision not
 
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
to update the fcc's 1996 limits for
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
exposure to regular frequency radiation
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
so in 2021 when the FCC was deemed by
 
00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
the U.S court of appeals to the D.C
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
circuit as having been arbitrary and
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
capricious in its refusal to update the
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
U.S FCC limits which were set in 1996
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
the court found that the FCC had ignored
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
record evidence including the impacts of
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
long-term Wireless exposure because
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
there has been no report by any federal
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
agency reviewing the impact of long-term
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
exposure especially to children and in
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
the new 5G environment the testimony of
 
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
people injured by Wireless radiation
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%

developing brain and reproduction now
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
the FCC was mandated to establish
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
reasonable record of review of the
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
evidence and to address issues that it
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
had ignored like children long-term
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
exposure and so forth but so far the FCC
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
has not responded so in my packet and I
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
can send you a online one that has links
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
to everything that is listed in there we
 
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:21.860 align:start position:0%
address how the FCC
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
limits and the case of cell tower
 
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
radiation really exemplifies the concept
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
of a regulatory Gap
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
there was no pre-market safety testing
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
for long-term damages from non-ionizing
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
radiation exposure by any federal agency
 
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
certainly not on up-to-date science
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
there was no there is no post-market
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
surveillance for health effects
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a risk analysis for
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
long-term effects yet there's an Ever
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
accumulating body of independent science
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
showing harmful effects uh is biological
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
effects adverse biological levels that
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
are in FCC limits
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
I also have in the packet page on
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
various setbacks of different
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
municipalities around the country uh
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you like
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
Shelburne Massachusetts 3 000 people
 
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
schools and 1 500 homes Copake New York
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
1500 feet home schools churches and
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
public buildings and so forth but what I
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
really wanted to address
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
was some of the information that's been
 
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.069 align:start position:0%
was some of the information that's been
presented

00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
that makes it seem like our federal
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
agencies have in fact opined or had an
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
opinion about whether radio frequency
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
radiation is safe or not
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
first of all the FDA
 
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
has no Authority regards to sell to poor
 
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.170 align:start position:0%
has no Authority regards to sell to poor
radiation

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
and has not reviewed the totality of at
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
least in any public way that we are
 
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.930 align:start position:0%
least in any public way that we are
aware

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:54.860 align:start position:0%
and just uh I have a quote in the packet
 
00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
where a mother wrote to the FDA and
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
actually several responses from the FDA
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
at this point and she requested safety
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
data on the small cell that was right in
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
front of her
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
and the director of the FDA office of
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
policy Center for devices and
 
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
radiological Health responded the FDA
 
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
does not regulate cell towers or cell
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
tower radiation therefore the FDA has no
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
studies or information on cell tower to
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
um there's a Pittsburgh law review
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
article entitled why radioency radiation
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
standards have failed to keep up with
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
technology that concludes the FCC and
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
FDA have failed their obligation to
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
prescribe safe radio frequency radiation
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines produced from wireless
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
communication devices to protect the
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
public health and safety
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
so what about the CDC
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
well there are no scientific reviews by
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
the CDC on wireless radiation that
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
evaluated the science in any systematic
 
00:12:59.569 --> 00:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
way or in any way actually that we're
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
aware of in fact our investigations
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
found that the CDC hired a consultant
 
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
with long-standing wireless industry
 
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
ties to serve subject matter expert on
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
their pages on non-ionizing radiation
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
and Wireless wearables
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
and we have all of that on our website
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
and they also I'll link to that
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
the National Cancer Institute
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
there are no scientific research reports
 
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
by the National Cancer Institute that
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
exist regarding 5G cell tower or even
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
cell phone safety and
 
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959 align:start position:0%
um I myself
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
contacted the National Cancer Institute
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
in 2016 because I had been told by my
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
municipality that the NCI somehow
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
supported the limits or had reviewed
 
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
and they responded back to me a
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
literature review
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
neither the literature reviews for the
 
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
fact sheet safe to determinate
 
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
and of course uh the New Hampshire uh
 
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
5G commit commission commissioner Denise
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
ricciardi uh got a response back from
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
the National Cancer Institute most
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
recently and I'll quote the NCI is not
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
involved in the regulation of radio
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
frequency Communications infrastructure
 
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
of devices where do we make
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations policies related to this
 
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.530 align:start position:0%
recommendations policies related to this
technology

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:23.540 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
now the American Cancer Society also has
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
cited as somehow supporting FCC limits
 
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
or saying that all you know providing
 
00:14:33.899 --> 00:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
or saying that all you know providing
services

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
but this is not true
 
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
the American Cancer States very clearly
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
that they don't have an official
 
00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
position or statement on whether or not
 
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
radio frequency radiation from cell
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
towers or others is a cause of cancer
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
and that's on their website and they
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
have not done any kind of review uh
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
related to wireless radio frequency
 
00:14:56.699 --> 00:14:58.129 align:start position:0%
related to wireless radio frequency
radiation

00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
the back story that after World War II
 
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
the U.S had developed a rather robust
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
research program involving several U.S
 
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.750 align:start position:0%
research program involving several U.S
agencies

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
in 1984
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Agency
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
released a report on the biological
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
effects of electromagnetic fields and uh
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
actually in the early 90s the EPA was
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
the recommended agency to develop human
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
exposure limits
 
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459 align:start position:0%
however at the mid 90s was also when
 
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
there was Heavy lobbying for the Telecom
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
in fact it was the most heavily lobbied
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
bill at that time ever
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
and by the time it passed in 1996 the
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency had been
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
fully defunded from their work on
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic fields and uh that was a
 
00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
few months after actually they had
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
presented the SEC how they were
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
developing safety limits that would be
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
based on heating effect
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
as well as non-thermal non-heating uh
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
biological effects but they were fully
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
defunded from developing safety limits
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
in fact we don't have federally
 
00:16:09.769 --> 00:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
developed safety limits those are
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
adopted limits by the FCC
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
so in 2020 I wrote the Environmental
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency about their opinion
 
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
and they responded epa's last review was
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
in the 1984 document to refer to the
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
biological effects of radio radiation
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
and they also said that the EPA does not
 
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
currently have a funded mandate for
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
radio frequency radiation manners and
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
what about the World Health Organization
 
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
that's also been quoted as somehow
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
providing safety influences
 
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
there is a web page that says no adverse
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
short prolonged helps have been shown
 
00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:48.949 align:start position:0%
short prolonged helps have been shown
however

00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
that is not based on a review of the
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
totality of the science and in fact
 
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:56.300 align:start position:0%
there are two separate entities
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
underneath the World Health Organization
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
umbrella one is the World Health
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
Organization EMF project that drafted
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
these online websites that everyone read
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
that we think provides safety assurances
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
and there are numerous published papers
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
documenting a long-standing industry
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
ties to the writers of these very web
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
and then there's an entity the
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
international Agency for research on
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
cancer which classified radio frequency
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
radiation as a possible carcinogen back
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
into 11. these are two separate entities
 
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
now the international Agency for
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
research on cancer has not convened
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
their expert working group to make
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
another determination based on the
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
newest science the animal studies and
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
other human studies that have been
 
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.169 align:start position:0%
other human studies that have been
published

00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
published
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
um so the who EMF project web pages are
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
not official determinations and actually
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
to just dive slightly even deeper if you
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
actually look at the who EMS side you'll
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
see that they haven't made any uh done
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
any reports since 1993. you can go to uh
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
the list where they have their
 
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
monographs and their reports and 1993 is
 
00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
the last report on radio frequency
 
00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:16.690 align:start position:0%
the last report on radio frequency
radiation

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:16.700 align:start position:0%
radiation
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's a 2022 letter that was published
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
in the Journal of the American Medical
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
Association by safe Jed Allen I'm
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
bringing this up because I have heard
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
statements uh to the committee that the
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
majority of studies don't find effects
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
but what this publication with this
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
letter fights that in fact the majority
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
of the latest science social effects
 
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
I'll just quote the 261 studies looking
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
at oxidative effects from radio
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
frequency radiation exposure
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
240 or 91 show damage of the 346 studies
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
on effects of radio frequency radiation
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
on genes
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
224 65 reported genetic damage
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
of the 300 36 study published on radio
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
frequency neurological effects 73
 
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
reported effects and only 27 percent
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
should go up at and there's a
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
Switzerland Institute of the environment
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
expert review which was published that
 
00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:19.150 align:start position:0%
expert review which was published that
found

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
increased oxidative stress in the
 
00:19:24.169 --> 00:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
majority of animal cell studies with
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
exposures within regulatory limits
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
so what federal agency
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
has authority of both funding or
 
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
studying cell tower radiation making
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
sure that the people and environment are
 
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.310 align:start position:0%
sure that the people and environment are
protected

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
protected
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
and the answer is none there actually is
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
no federal agency with any health or uh
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
or environment expertise that is
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
ensuring safety that's looking at the
 
00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:49.850 align:start position:0%
ensuring safety that's looking at the
research

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.529 align:start position:0%
research
um

00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:50.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
scientifically looking at the level but
 
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:54.980 align:start position:0%
which effects have been found in studies
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
evaluating the uh the studies for their
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
quality and making a determination
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
other countries not the United States
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
they monitor the radio frequency levels
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
some have real-time 5G monitoring
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
stations some have uh monitors which are
 
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
in your schools or other vulnerable
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
areas as they combined and they
 
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
are writing in a public way there's web
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
where you can look up what is the level
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
what are the level here what a level
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
there in France if you want to know what
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
the level is in your community you go to
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
your mayor your request a reading and
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
you can get that by law in a lot of
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
countries have it free posted on
 
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
websites so when it comes to the ambient
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
radiation from cell towers
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
we have a regulatory Gap
 
00:20:46.919 --> 00:20:49.010 align:start position:0%
we have a regulatory Gap
and

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
I am glad and questions I guess I would
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
like to end with this one quote from a
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
letter that was published in the Journal
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
of the National Cancer Institute and the
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
experts who published this let it's
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
about a study that seemed to show uh
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
safety but actually the design of it
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
it was irrelevant to the way we use
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
technology today and the way we're
 
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%

um Professor Paul beneshai and a
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
neurosurgeon Hillel Baldwin published
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
this letter which states the majority of
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
animal and cell Studies have found
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
non-hypnizing radio frequency radiation
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
can induce oxidative stress a key
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
characteristic of human carcinogen in a
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
way that radio frequency can initiate or
 
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
promote tumor development as well as
 
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
play a role in the development of other
 
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.409 align:start position:0%

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
DNA damage and cancer and
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art studies signal the need
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
for the public to reduce exposures to
 
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:00.860 align:start position:0%
radio frequency radiation now
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad to answer any questions as
 
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:04.970 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad to answer any questions as
well

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you mrado uh
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
before I I go on to that I did receive a
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
note here so I will make an announcement
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh apparently some observers have
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
come in here with signs
 
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
signs or placards are not allowed in the
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee room if you would be so kind
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
as to place them outside in the hallway
 
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
please so that they're not in this
 
00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:30.299 align:start position:0%
community room I I know they're not
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
being shown here that's fine but I would
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
prefer that the signs be kept outside of
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
this committee room if you can make that
 
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
with that being said uh does the
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee have any questions yes uh
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
you only have to put up with me for a
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
of course green would be off how
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
we're back in session
 
00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:07.669 align:start position:0%
we're back in session
um

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
my question is why
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
or do you think that it would be
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the Health and Human
 
00:23:15.179 --> 00:23:16.610 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the Health and Human
Services

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
to join with the Science and Technology
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
and the municipal County Government
 
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.610 align:start position:0%
and the municipal County Government
to

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
explore getting information out about
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
this subject I I think it's not a one a
 
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
one Committee in my mind it's not a one
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
committee effort and I do believe that
 
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:42.380 align:start position:0%
5G is
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
being deployed as we speak
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
and we don't know where
 
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:51.380 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
situation that we have uh as a committee
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
is that we have given
 
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:01.700 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say given up but we have
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh given up the ability to regulate
 
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:07.860 align:start position:0%
communication so it has to be done in my
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
mind on a local level what do you think
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
about those entities joining together
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
yeah well we have recommended that
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I'm getting feedback so it I
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
have to just not hear the feedback when
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
I speak of my apologies
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
um so we are recommending that agencies
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
with health expertise
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
be involved in a full review of the
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
totality of the science I mean right now
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
the feds you know there's no one
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
watching the ball that's what we have a
 
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
situation where everyone's pointing at
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
everyone else but there isn't an entity
 
00:24:50.049 --> 00:24:50.059 align:start position:0%
doing that so at the federal level
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
unless it you know it has not been made
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
public where there's been any overview
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
of this issue so it would make sense for
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
the health you know expert agencies with
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
health expertise to be looking at this
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
issue it really need there needs to be a
 
00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:08.299 align:start position:0%
full and Frank
 
00:25:08.299 --> 00:25:10.130 align:start position:0%
full and Frank
transparent

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
review of all of the science with the
 
00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:15.539 align:start position:0%
ability for comments just like you would
 
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you at may I of course the and and
 
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
what about the follow-up since we as a
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
federal government perhaps is lagging a
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
um the state government really doesn't
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
have the authority
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
unless we declare this an emergency
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
working with the local level because
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
that's where you can
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
I believe control we were talking about
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
where these things go up these towers
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the proximity to schools and
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
hospitals so also working with local
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that that's the
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
way it has to proceed here have you any
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
other experience with that
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
well at the local level it is my
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that what other
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
communities are doing is having
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
preferences that there can be priority
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
locations rather than every space is
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
available to companies but prioritizing
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
career facilities should be because you
 
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
can't prohibit service however a
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
communities can at the local level uh
 
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:37.940 align:start position:0%
you know make decisions about
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
where placements should be based on the
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
local state and federal law so
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and and I am not a lawyer who works
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
in uh the issue of New Hampshire law so
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
I can't speak any further than that but
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
I can't say that around the country
 
00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
communities are uh having more
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
responsible placement and I think one
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
thing is that a lot of decision makers
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
you know at the very local level they
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that they don't know what
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
other communities are doing they don't
 
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
know they're they're being told that
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
they can't do anything that the in fact
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
I'm going to quote a decision maker in
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
my community who said and I quote they
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
were commanded by the FCC and quote to
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
allow cell towers in homes in a
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
residential area and that's really not
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
true it's it's really uh not factual so
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
I think sussing out what is what
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
communities can do and empowering
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
communities to do the most that they can
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
to just protect their residential
 
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
Communities In Schools and vulnerable
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
areas is something that many experts are
 
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.110 align:start position:0%
areas is something that many experts are
advocating

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
any more questions from our subcommittee
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your presentation and
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
I am looking at the paper that you uh
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
submitted to us oh and I'm wondering if
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
you need a copy of your testimony as
 
00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:13.789 align:start position:0%
you need a copy of your testimony as
well

00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
is that possible yeah thank you so much
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and I'm seeing a number of small
 
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
towns small municipalities actually
 
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.130 align:start position:0%
towns small municipalities actually
taking

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:21.140 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh action against the FCC do you think
 
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.289 align:start position:0%
uh action against the FCC do you think
that's

00:28:26.289 --> 00:28:26.299 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
uh well how can I say this uh
 
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
is that the most appropriate place to uh
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
seek uh action to
 
00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:39.380 align:start position:0%
um investigate the situation
 
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
because do the local communities
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
actually have the resources is my real
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think I'm hearing you correctly it's a
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
little fuzzy
 
00:28:51.769 --> 00:28:51.779 align:start position:0%
um but you're wondering about local
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
action as an appropriate Avenue
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
um and so what are you referring to
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
specifically because I think what's
 
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
happened is local communities are trying
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
to have authority in their community and
 
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
so they are filing are you talking about
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
um New York or well I'm wondering really
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
how these communities that you listed
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
here actually made this change in their
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
local ordinances to make these things
 
00:29:18.659 --> 00:29:20.389 align:start position:0%
local ordinances to make these things
possible

00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
um considering that uh it's a
 
00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:24.289 align:start position:0%
um considering that uh it's a
municipality

00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:29:24.299 --> 00:29:25.610 align:start position:0%
municipality
um

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
basically questioning the FCC rather
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
than their uh State you know it's it
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
almost seems like the mouse against the
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
elephant situation is it the most
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
effective way to question FCC
 
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.210 align:start position:0%
effective way to question FCC
um

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:40.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh legislation by having local
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
communities do this or it would be
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
better on a state level
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
well that's a really good question and I
 
00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
think some of the further uh testifiers
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
are going to address this more deeply
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that in our
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
community in Montgomery County Maryland
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
where I live the county actually filed a
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against the filed against the
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
FCC saying they were putting the cart
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
before the horse that they had that they
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
were streamlining in the 2019 and 18 uh
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations that facts tracked
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
5G and small cells into communities
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
without having fully reviewed the 1996
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
limits now what ended up happening was
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
the FCC made a decision that in
 
00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:30.059 align:start position:0%
um that which is what we which was what
 
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
environmental health trust and their
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
petitioners filed against saying that we
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
don't have to update our limits so then
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
the case that the county these are two
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
separate cases the case that the county
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
put forward ended up being moot however
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
that wasn't based on the merits of the
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
case it was simply that the FCC had just
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
made made its decision but it really
 
00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
remains a really good question I mean
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
how can we Fast Track these local
 
00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
communities are being told uh by uh in
 
00:30:57.779 --> 00:30:58.789 align:start position:0%
communities are being told uh by uh in
various

00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
various
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
um you know uh information that's being
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
put forward to them that they have to
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
allow cell antennas near homes and by
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
the way in Washington DC where the
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
people were not given a voice and there
 
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
was no transparent process the setback
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
is 10 feet
 
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
now how can this be when we have these
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
limits that haven't been fully reviewed
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
and that's really the question it comes
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
down to the local communities where
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
people are getting these installations
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
in front of their homes and they're
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
asking the very simple question is this
 
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.250 align:start position:0%
asking the very simple question is this
safe

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
and how do you know it's safe and how do
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
I know you know this is something that
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
for for every other issue we would have
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
a data and documents and a full and
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
transparent review we would know what
 
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
we're even exposed to whereas in the
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
United States we don't have uh Federal
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
oversight as we do with many other
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
issues and certainly not like they're
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
like that so much I know we have a
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
lawyer also uh who can answer some of
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
the more the questions about
 
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well yeah yes thank
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
you so much uh for your presentation uh
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
is comment for the chair a brief yes uh
 
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
I think could we switch up and have uh
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
Scott Scott
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
um call off go first because I think
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
it'll he'll answer these questions okay
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
yes I was just going to say thank you
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony I have
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
given a lot of leeway this morning to
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
the first presenter I will thank you
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
very much for that uh but we knew if we
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
can keep our next presentations a little
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
bit shorter that would be great to allow
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
us time for for more questions so with
 
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
that being said I will invite Mr Scott
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
McCullough to go on next to brief and
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
then after that we'll I'll turn my
 
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
attention to a testifier from from the
 
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
other side so we can keep this balanced
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr McCulloch
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I hope you can hear
 
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.669 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I hope you can hear
me

00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:57.350 align:start position:0%
me
fine

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Chicago Cub I'm a
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
telecommunications lawyer
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
um been practicing in this area for
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
almost 40 years now
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years there's
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
I've been in the wireless space more
 
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
particularly dealing with national
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
standards and also working within
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities and counties helping them
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
develop ordinances so that they can
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
maintain the flexibility that Congress
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
gave them while still adhering to the
 
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
few restrictions that Congress didn't
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
put in place
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
well I I'd like to start out very
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
quickly talking about a couple of other
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations in the commission Rec uh
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
report specifically recommendations 2 8
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
and 12.
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
I think these are really important
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
nothing in the communications Act
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
reports or the FCC rules
 
00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
purports to restrict
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
what a state or a local jurisdiction
 
00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:06.380 align:start position:0%
itself can say
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
or do by way of Education
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
to the citizens
 
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:16.580 align:start position:0%
they can conduct studies if they wish
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:19.970 align:start position:0%
they can
um

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
make some required disclosures of the
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
wireless industry although some carriers
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
required in that area
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
um they can to some extent
 
00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:34.730 align:start position:0%
um they can to some extent
um

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
disclose what the science is not to some
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
extent but fully disclose what the
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
science is in this area they can help
 
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
citizens that are concerned about
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
exposure find ways to reduce that
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
exposure acting in on their own
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
now let's get to the issue that I think
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
is probably of
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
most interest to me on this committee
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
and that is what can local jurisdictions
 
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.630 align:start position:0%
and that is what can local jurisdictions
do

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
the wireless industry of course tells
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
all these cities that their hands are
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
completely tied that is not true what
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
they have is about three strings around
 
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
what they cannot do is they cannot
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
discriminate between types of
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
telecommunication Services unreasonably
 
00:35:27.359 --> 00:35:28.910 align:start position:0%
telecommunication Services unreasonably
discriminate

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
they cannot affectively prohibit
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
the provision of service
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
and they cannot regulate
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
Emissions on the basis of the
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
environmental effects of those but that
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
still leaves lots of flexibility within
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
local jurisdictions
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
they are still free
 
00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:53.099 align:start position:0%
to exercise regulation that is
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with their local values with
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
a concern to property values and they
 
00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:00.950 align:start position:0%
a concern to property values and they
can

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
make sure that the facilities are there
 
00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
are put into place that is safe
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
and does not ruin visual views
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
um you know they can they can make sure
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
that the facilities have proper
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics which is the term that is
 
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.370 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics which is the term that is
used

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
so just to give you a couple of examples
 
00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:26.690 align:start position:0%
so just to give you a couple of examples
um

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
a local jurisdiction
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
can on safe grounds
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
impose what are called Folsom if you
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
have a 100 foot Tower
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
you can require that that Tower be
 
00:36:45.290 --> 00:36:45.300 align:start position:0%
placed so that if it were to fall
 
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
the fall zone or the or the area where
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
it will work and fall without hurting
 
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.349 align:start position:0%
it will work and fall without hurting
anything

00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
can be you know 100 percent or 125
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
because typically when these things fall
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
they created to brief you so a
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
municipality could say if you've got a
 
00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
100 foot Tower you can't have
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
residential or business buildings or
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
streets within
 
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:12.740 align:start position:0%
125 feet
 
00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
equally important they can have what are
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
called setbacks they can impose
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
presumptive setbacks so that
 
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
for example a wireless facility cannot
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
be within 500 or 700 feet or uh like the
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
commission recommended
 
00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:35.339 align:start position:0%
even up to 15 or 1600 feet
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
notice I said presumptive
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to setbacks however
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
you do need to have what we call a
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
waiver process in place
 
00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
so that even though the general rule
 
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
would prohibit placing of a facility in
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
a given location say they wanted 300
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
feet from a residential area and the
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
setback is 750 feet or 1500 feet if
 
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
there was a waiver process in place so
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the wireless carrier can come in
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
and show
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
that unless it gets a permit in this
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
specific location
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
then it would suffer an effective
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
prohibition of service
 
00:38:23.329 --> 00:38:23.339 align:start position:0%
the local jurisdiction can impose the
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
level of the burden of proof that is
 
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
required to rebut the presumption
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
many jurisdictions require clear and
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
it typically it let's just say you want
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
to have a 750 or 1600 foot setback from
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
residential areas
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
that would basically rule out a small
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
cell or a macro in a residential area
 
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140 align:start position:0%
but if the wireless carrier you can come
 
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
in and say you know I've got to have it
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
right here in this spot in the middle of
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
this residential area
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
or else I will suffer and hopeful
 
00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.370 align:start position:0%
or else I will suffer and hopeful
prohibition

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
the local jurisdiction can then make we
 
00:39:08.569 --> 00:39:08.579 align:start position:0%
will give you that waiver if you prove
 
00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
effective prohibition through clear and
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that will pass most
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
under the federal law
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
let me give you a couple of examples
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
Bedford New Hampshire
 
00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
has a 100 percent fall zone requirement
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
and a 750 setback requirement for
 
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.750 align:start position:0%
and a 750 setback requirement for
residential

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
residential
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
Scarsdale New York
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
has 500 foot setbacks from residential
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
daycare facilities schools houses of
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
worship and Parklands Scarsdale also
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
requires that facilities be 1 000 feet
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
apart from each other so if there is a
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
small cell in one location somebody else
 
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
cannot put a small cell within month
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
thousand feet of that one
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
a Shelbourne of Massachusetts has a 1500
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
foot setback requirement for residential
 
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.290 align:start position:0%
foot setback requirement for residential
structure

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
like 3 000 put spent back from the
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
property lines of schools
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
kopaki New York and I may be
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
mispronouncing that name uh they have a
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
1500 foot setback requirement
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
um which also includes not only
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
residential but schools
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
San Diego County has 1 000 foot setback
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
requirements and they also have a 300
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
foot setback for schools Child Care
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
Centers hospitals religious facilities
 
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
fire stations
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
or Sheriff's Station
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
Malibu has 500 Malibu California has 500
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
foot setbacks from schools playgrounds
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
and parks and a presumptive ban on
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
residential areas now again all of these
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
need to have their waiver process
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
but they can require a high burden to
 
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
but they can require a high burden to
prove

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
prove
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
and a local jurisdiction can do this for
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
many reasons completely independent of
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
Health concern
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
they can say we don't like these
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
unsightly things in residential areas no
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
matter how much we dress them up with
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
whatever it looks like some kind of tree
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's in our area uh we put them in
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
church looking buildings we make it look
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
like a steeple uh they're still just
 
00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:34.550 align:start position:0%
like a steeple uh they're still just
ugly

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
ugly
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
people don't like them nearby they
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
reduce property values perhaps
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
this is a non-health reason it is
 
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
perfectly permissive
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
another good reason to very much
 
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:50.900 align:start position:0%
regulate where these devices might be
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
particularly in residential areas
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
is if you put one near a corner say
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
where there is a cul-de-sac a street
 
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
that only has one means of entrance
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
these things are as Susan Foster going
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
to tell you a little bit sometimes they
 
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
are fire hazards
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
you need to as a local jurisdiction make
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
sure that if one of these works you take
 
00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:17.030 align:start position:0%
sure that if one of these works you take
fire

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
fire
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
well everybody would have a means to
 
00:42:23.329 --> 00:42:23.339 align:start position:0%
escape and go somewhere else around it
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
in that regard one other area where
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
local jurisdictions are beginning to
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
implement more regulation and I would
 
00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:34.220 align:start position:0%
encourage you to put this in any
 
00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:36.500 align:start position:0%
legislation that you have
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
emphasize that the local jurisdiction
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
can still make sure that these
 
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.190 align:start position:0%
can still make sure that these
facilities

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
of when constructed will be compliant
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
with all fire electrical and other
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
structural Safety Code
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether they be national state or local
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
there are codes that require that things
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
these things be designed properly
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
if they require the registered
 
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:08.339 align:start position:0%
professional engineer present a design
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
that shows and says up front I have
 
00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
looked at this it will be wired properly
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
it meets all electrical codes and it
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
meets also applicable structural safety
 
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.589 align:start position:0%
meets also applicable structural safety
requirements

00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
um local jurisdictions can we do this
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
they're they're increasingly do this
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
because as you are about to find out
 
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
many of these facilities for some reason
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
seem to take fire
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any questions
 
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr McCullough very interesting
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh I will do a Chairman's privilege and
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
ask a question first just curious based
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
on the examples that you were giving
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
other than safety if there was any uh
 
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:55.220 align:start position:0%
legislation there was to come forward
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
involving say uh or pertaining to the
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
examples that you gave would you say
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
that that legislation would be more
 
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
appropriate for uh Science and Tech
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee or more appropriate for
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.390 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
um your legislature handles its
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee assignments
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
but I
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
um you know there are many ways to deal
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
with that maybe both committees should
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
weigh in on it but this does seem to be
 
00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
a Science and Tech issue
 
00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:35.540 align:start position:0%
um although of course
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
any legislation would have to take into
 
00:44:38.339 --> 00:44:39.829 align:start position:0%
any legislation would have to take into
account

00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
um the way that the state has delegated
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
to your local municipalities how they
 
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
exercise their zoning
 
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.849 align:start position:0%
exercise their zoning
so

00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe a joint call maybe a
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
joint reference
 
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.910 align:start position:0%
joint reference
um

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
you do have to make sure when you write
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
any legislation about zoning that you
 
00:45:02.569 --> 00:45:02.579 align:start position:0%
kind of make sure that it works with
 
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
whatever the existing law is because as
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities are considering these
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
Wireless ordinances what they typically
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
do is they put it into their code their
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
local code and they have to make it work
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
within the existing code even though
 
00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700 align:start position:0%
they are making amendments they will use
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
similar definitions they will use
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
similar processes as they do for any
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
other kind of land use permit
 
00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you any other question
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
represent Kelly Pitts
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
they're gonna be glad to get rid of me
 
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
um you seem to be talking about new
 
00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.750 align:start position:0%
um you seem to be talking about new
construction

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
what about add-ons when they're adding
 
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.130 align:start position:0%
what about add-ons when they're adding
on

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
this particular service to an existing
 
00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:51.050 align:start position:0%
this particular service to an existing
Tower

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
Tower
 
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
um how do you regulate that because the
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
Talent is already there and they're just
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
there are two kinds of
 
00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:08.579 align:start position:0%
additions to an existing facility
 
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
one is called co-location
 
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.829 align:start position:0%
one is called co-location
where

00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
um you may have say an existing Tower
 
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.370 align:start position:0%
um you may have say an existing Tower
with

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
only one wireless provider having
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
equipment there and a second wireless
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
provider is going to come in put more
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
equipment and put more antennas on the
 
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.670 align:start position:0%
equipment and put more antennas on the
tower

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
tower
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
that's called co-location
 
00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:34.859 align:start position:0%
um the FCC has established a shot clock
 
00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
period for that I believe it's 90 days
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
um but otherwise uh the municipality is
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
still free to ensure for example that it
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
is code compliant
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
they can make sure that the tower uh
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully is already aesthetically
 
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.170 align:start position:0%
hopefully is already aesthetically
pleasing

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
pleasing
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
I you do find that without a country
 
00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:00.619 align:start position:0%
most local jurisdictions actually
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
encourage co-location
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
they want people to put their facilities
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
any new facilities where there is
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
already a tower and this is especially
 
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to macro Tower
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
so oh you know I think actually what you
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
might want to do is encourage local
 
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions to uh put when they are
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
prioritizing where they want new
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
facilities to prioritize co-location up
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
top because as you know it is already
 
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.829 align:start position:0%
top because as you know it is already
there

00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
there was a second kind that I do need
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
to mention
 
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
um it's what they call an exempt
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
facility you may have an existing Tower
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
and an existing wireless equipment and
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
the wireless provider that is already
 
00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:49.849 align:start position:0%
the wireless provider that is already
there

00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
wants to swap out some of the gear or
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
maybe put some new antennas on there
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
well that is a special kind of
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
application for which there is a
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
particular Federal piece of legislation
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
and some FCC rules
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
they're basically must approve in other
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
words if they meet the criteria for it
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
being an exempt facility
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
then the local jurisdiction does not
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
have much Choice
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
um so long as
 
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
you know it still meets safety
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for example
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's probably for the most part a must
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
approve but once again this is going in
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
you would you would probably prefer that
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
they put equipment where there's already
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
facilities and towers and having new
 
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.309 align:start position:0%
facilities and towers and having new
Talent

00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.150 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
um see no question from our committee
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions from other members
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative barinsky
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
um on the examples uh there's quite a
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
wide range of distances for Shelburne
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
M.A uh it's 3 000 feet for schools and
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
then in New York there's a 500 feet
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
um so with such a wide range which is
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
the correct distance to place these
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
towers thank you
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
if you were talking about setbacks I'm
 
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
going to support the um
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
the committee's recommendation of 1600
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
feet uh that's an appropriate distance
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
um even small cells can work at that
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
distance remember again and this is a
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
presumptive setback
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
um it is the way that we want them to
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
design and try to configure their
 
00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.890 align:start position:0%
design and try to configure their
Networks

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
Networks
 
00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
if the wireless provider can show that
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
it needs a shorter distance then there
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
probably does need to be a waiver
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
process for it to come in Meet the
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate burden approved and show
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
that um you know a shorter separation
 
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.130 align:start position:0%
that um you know a shorter separation
distance

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
distance
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
uh is necessary or else it is an
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
okay uh last question and I think you
 
00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
answer this uh in your uh discussion but
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
I'll ask it again
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
if a community is going to put in a
 
00:50:30.599 --> 00:50:31.630 align:start position:0%
if a community is going to put in a
setback

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
setback
 
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
they must provide a reason for that
 
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
setback uh other than health
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
reasons or emission reasons
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
um did I understand that correctly is is
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
that they they need to prove why they
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
well if we are talking about an
 
00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.230 align:start position:0%
well if we are talking about an
ordinance

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
um or a
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
piece of State legislation that is
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
telling a local jurisdiction what it
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
should put in an ordinance then yes I
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
would recommend that there be in the
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
findings whether it be of the
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
legislation or the local ordinance the
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
they are preferring to have these
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
setbacks fall zones and separation
 
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
distance on a presumptive basis and
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons that are fully
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
lawful under under the federal act uh
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
including Aesthetics including property
 
00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:32.569 align:start position:0%
including Aesthetics including property
values

00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
values
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
um including other visual effects and
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
then of course electrical firing
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
structural safety
 
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:44.099 align:start position:0%
if they invoke these reasons and then I
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
think that it is perfectly permissible
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
and of course with the waiver process
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
you will not have a problem with
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony Mitch McCullough
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it very much and I
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
appreciate you keeping it short that was
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
great thank you I'm going to call on I
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to go uh deviate over
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
here and call on a is there a Gerald
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
brushberg is it
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
here yes he's here physically uh you're
 
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
invited to come up and come to the mic
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and committee members
 
00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.770 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and committee members
uh

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and committee members I
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to provide
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
some additional uh information I'm a
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
clinical professor of radiology and
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
radiation oncology at the University of
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
California uh at Davis and uh my
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
credentials and experience in this area
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
have been provided to you in a handout
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
on the very last page you'll find uh
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
more detail regarding my experience
 
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
excuse me if you could get a little
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic please so we can all
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
um in the packet that I've given you I
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to go over every single point
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
of information here but I wanted to
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
point out
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
um several that I think will be helpful
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh to provide some additional details of
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
what you've heard uh already
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
so uh if we could first turn uh
 
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
um well oh and by the way I failed to
 
00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:30.140 align:start position:0%
mention that there is a disclaimer
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
on page two item four of course I
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
represent myself and my viewers don't
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily represent the views of my
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
University or or other institutions that
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
I have been Affiliated or I'm currently
 
00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
affiliated with
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
okay having said that uh we could turn
 
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.750 align:start position:0%
okay having said that uh we could turn
to

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
area of you know the expert opinions and
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
it's been said that
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
that the FDA uh doesn't have
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh regulatory Authority in this area
 
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
that's true but it doesn't mean that
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
they have not reviewed the science or
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
opined on its
 
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:24.140 align:start position:0%
safety of Wireless technology
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
in their latest fact
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
um statement they say as you can see on
 
00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:32.700 align:start position:0%
slides 19 and 20 that to date no
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
consistent or credible scientific
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
evidence of health problems is caused by
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
exposure to radio frequency energy
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
emitted by cell phones and then they go
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
on in the next slide to explain
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
um that the gold standard for assessment
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
of risk to the public are largely
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
and I say that the currently available
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies Public Health
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
surveillance data and supportive
 
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
laboratory studies on cell phone
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
radiation provide abundant evidence to
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
support the fda's determinations that's
 
00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:05.339 align:start position:0%
a direct quote not my interpretation but
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
their opinion
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
the next uh slide 21 which is very
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to read but I can provide you
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
with a more visible copy later if you
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
wish but it basically represents a whole
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
number of uh committees have been put
 
00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:26.660 align:start position:0%
together by
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
countries and agencies around the world
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
that have asked the same question you
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
know as it say for the public to be
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
exposed to RF energy at the levels at or
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
below the standard
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
and I think when you review these
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
documents if you so wish you'd find that
 
00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
there there is a consensus that doesn't
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
mean that there aren't questions and it
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we know everything
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to know or everything
 
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
that uh can be known but based on the
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
evidence as it existed at the time that
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
these various panels review the science
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
and some of these are very very recent
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of them in fact all on
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
this list that I could find aren't
 
00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
supportive health and safety standards
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
that are very similar to the ones in
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to turn to slide 25s on page
 
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:26.470 align:start position:0%
if you want to turn to slide 25s on page
13.

00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
this is a report by IRC which issues the
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
support periodically it's referred to as
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
the world cancer report
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
um and it details cancer research and
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations for cancer prevention
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
they did review both ionizing and
 
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing radiation as you can see
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
and when they got to the study of RF and
 
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:00.260 align:start position:0%
this is a very recent report
 
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:02.300 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
RF radiation is not listed by IRC in the
 
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:09.770 align:start position:0%
world cancer report as a carcinogen
 
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:10.990 align:start position:0%
world cancer report as a carcinogen
[Music]

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
it's true that it was listed in an IR
 
00:57:17.049 --> 00:57:17.059 align:start position:0%
committee report as a possible
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
carcinogen but this is a more recent and
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
up-to-date statement from iarc which
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
says that most of the epidemiological
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
evidence does not support an association
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
between mobile phone use and tumor
 
00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
occurrences in the head which is part of
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
the body with the highest exposure
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
levels the radio frequency
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic fields and studies
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
reporting positive associations
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
it is difficult to exclude various forms
 
00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
of bias such as recall bias and
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
if we can turn to page 20 or to slide 27
 
00:58:04.809 --> 00:58:04.819 align:start position:0%
again the National Cancer Institute is
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
does not
 
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
have a regulatory Authority in this area
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
but they they care about what does and
 
00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
and likely does not cause cancer and
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
they have had several fact sheets
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
one in particular that I think is very
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
clear is
 
00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
um they were they've said about the
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
cancer-causing effects of RF energy at
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
slide 27 and it says although there have
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
been some concerns that radio frequency
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
energy from cell phones how close the
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
head may affect the brain and other
 
00:58:37.010 --> 00:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
tissues today there's no evidence from
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
studies in cells animals or humans that
 
00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:41.579 align:start position:0%
RF radio frequency energy can cause
 
00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:42.770 align:start position:0%
RF radio frequency energy can cause
cancer

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh there was a concern if you look at
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
next slide 28
 
00:58:47.099 --> 00:58:47.690 align:start position:0%
next slide 28
um

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
about long-term effects and children
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
fortunately one of the largest or the
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
largest study was recently published in
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
February of this year it's referred to
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
as the Moby kids study
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
and it involved over 2 000
 
00:59:11.289 --> 00:59:11.299 align:start position:0%
individuals in
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
a number of different countries I think
 
00:59:18.349 --> 00:59:18.359 align:start position:0%
it was 15 or so and the conclusion which
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'll just direct your attention to at
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
the bottom right is that they found no
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
increase of neuroepithelial brain tumors
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
either in relationship to wireless phone
 
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
I know that uh there's been testimony
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
about the ntp study and a lot of uh
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
concern about what the study said and
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
what it didn't say
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
ntp itself has
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
tried to provide some color around that
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
issue and if you look at slide 29
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
they have an FAQ this is from the ntp
 
00:59:57.119 --> 00:59:58.549 align:start position:0%
they have an FAQ this is from the ntp
themselves

00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
and they asked the question that is
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
often asked of them
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
which is how do RF levels used in the
 
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
studies compare to typical human
 
01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.089 align:start position:0%
studies compare to typical human
exposures

01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
exposures
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
and they make the point that the
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
exposures in the experiments were much
 
01:00:13.089 --> 01:00:13.099 align:start position:0%
much higher
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
than would be expected
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
from use of cell phones or even or in
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
particular cell towers in an environment
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.970 align:start position:0%
particular cell towers in an environment
um

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
and then they ask do the rat and mouse
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
studies apply to humans and their answer
 
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.670 align:start position:0%
studies apply to humans and their answer
is

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
the findings in animals cannot be
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
directly applied to humans for two key
 
01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:36.410 align:start position:0%
directly applied to humans for two key
reasons

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
first exposure levels and the durations
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
were greater than what people receive
 
01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
and the second bullet is that rats and
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
mice received rfr across their whole
 
01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
bodies which is different than the more
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
localized exposures people get from cell
 
01:00:53.339 --> 01:00:54.410 align:start position:0%
localized exposures people get from cell
phones

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
phones
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
now to put it more in perspective I
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
think you would need to compare the
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
levels of exposure that they use to what
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
is allowed by the FCC for whole body
 
01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.390 align:start position:0%
is allowed by the FCC for whole body
exposure

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
and there the
 
01:01:10.089 --> 01:01:10.099 align:start position:0%
um you can see that on the very last
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
line of this slide that the exposures
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
range from somewhere between 18 to 75
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
times greater than the maximum that is
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
allowed for public exposure so that is
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
to their point about it not being
 
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
the next point I wanted to make is about
 
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of conflicting data and
 
01:01:38.450 --> 01:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's been very frustrating for
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
you to receive what seems like absolute
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
fact on one side an absolute fact on the
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
other side and and the reality is is
 
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
that it's uh it's not quite so clear
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
and research in and of itself uh is not
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
a precise science like physics for
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
example it involves biological studies
 
01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
which have large margins for potential
 
01:02:01.619 --> 01:02:02.690 align:start position:0%
which have large margins for potential
air

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
air
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
and an epidemiological studies which was
 
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
the study of disease of populations and
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:13.940 align:start position:0%
there are any number of potential
 
01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:17.900 align:start position:0%
problems that can occur in such a study
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
my professor of epidemiology said to me
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was the first state of the
 
01:02:25.130 --> 01:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
class that the best thing about
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
epidemiology is that it studies the
 
01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
organism of interest you know us
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
and then she said but then it's downhill
 
01:02:35.089 --> 01:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
in a hurry and what she meant and what
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
we spent the rest of the time in our
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
class talking about
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
were all the kinds of biases that can
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
creep into these studies and you see
 
01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
some of them there on this list recall
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
in bias
 
01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:51.740 align:start position:0%
effects of uh inaccurate reporting
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
exposure assessment limitations and
 
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
sufficient follow-up inadequate
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
statistical power and so forth
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
um and then on the next slide I want to
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
make the point that's been made many
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
times by other scientists and especially
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
Journal editors is that our current
 
01:03:12.609 --> 01:03:12.619 align:start position:0%
scientific literature is really quite
 
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
mixed with regard to the quality of the
 
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.109 align:start position:0%
mixed with regard to the quality of the
science

01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
science
 
01:03:20.289 --> 01:03:20.299 align:start position:0%
these are statements from nature
 
01:03:24.609 --> 01:03:24.619 align:start position:0%
and from Journal science and from Forbes
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
basically saying that
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
maybe half of the studies are are cannot
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
be replicated
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
and Richard Horton who's the editor to
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
Chief at the time of the Lancet was
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
quoted in the limited time saying that
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
the case against science is
 
01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:42.059 align:start position:0%
straightforward much of the literature
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps half May Simply Be untrue
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to slide 33
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
it really is the quality of the science
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
that is the center of the controversy at
 
01:03:56.809 --> 01:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
least in my view
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
and what you have if you start at the
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
top there
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
is a slide 33. uh you have an assertion
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
of a non-thermal adverse Health effect
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
of course that is a a very important and
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
Sensational item and so the media covers
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
it with a great zest and it no doubt
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
increases public anxiety
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
however the resolution of such a claim
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
requires verification replication other
 
01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
studies which can take years to do
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
if they fail to confirm the original
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
study which is often the case
 
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
that receives very little or no media
 
01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:40.309 align:start position:0%
that receives very little or no media
attention

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
and so you have this perpetuation of
 
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
many false claims that erodes public
 
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
just to give you one example
 
01:04:56.819 --> 01:04:57.410 align:start position:0%
just to give you one example
um

01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
this is a paper that was published in a
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed journal
 
01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:05.180 align:start position:0%
um as well thought of
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
it was a paper by Dr uh
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
Martin Paul who has been cited
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
previously in this committee as a as one
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
of the champions of explaining the
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which RF energy
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
can adversely affect human health at
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
non-thermal levels
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
and he goes on to explain in his theory
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
that is specifically regarding the 5G
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
millimeter waves
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
that the electric fields are almost
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
completely absorbed up the outer one
 
01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:42.299 align:start position:0%
millimeter of the body due to their High
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
dielectric constant
 
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
of biological aqueous phases however the
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
magnetic fields are highly penetrating
 
01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
well this if you turn to slide 37
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
is a fundamental error of basic physics
 
01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
that most high school physics teachers
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
if not their students would be aware
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh electromagnetic radiation is a
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
Quantum phenomena it
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
it is one of the part of the standard
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
model of elementary particle physics
 
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:17.420 align:start position:0%
it's referred to as a photon of energy
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
and Elementary means that it cannot be
 
01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
subdivided any further into its
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
component parts
 
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:25.970 align:start position:0%
component parts
uh

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
insofar as his rationale and the
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
development of his conclusions are based
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
on this really fundamental error that
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
that the magnetic fields would continue
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
to penetrate while the electrical Fields
 
01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:41.339 align:start position:0%
would not means that the all the
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
conclusion is drawn there would be
 
01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:48.059 align:start position:0%
incorrect also start interrupt we are
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
running Along on time are you almost
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
within a minute of wrapping up because I
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
didn't think we were going to go through
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
all these slides here okay and we've
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of this technical stuff
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
before but if you can just wrap it up in
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
the next minute okay well let me just
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
turn to one thing that I think is maybe
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
more germane to and pertinent to the to
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
the issues before you and if you look at
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
it shows uh levels of RF exposure that
 
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
have been set by different countries and
 
01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.569 align:start position:0%
have been set by different countries and
organizations

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
and you can see that that some or are a
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
hundred times less than what is
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
recommended by the FCC or by the
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
European or who ignur recommendations
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
and uh and you say well okay there's a
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
lot of variability here why is that and
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
if I had time I would explain some of
 
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
that but I think the more important
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
point is that when you look at the
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
typical exposures from these types of
 
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:53.579 align:start position:0%
facilities and there was a very
 
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
extensive review
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
of individuals carrying monitors to
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
measure their exposure as a two almost a
 
01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:02.299 align:start position:0%
quarter million people
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
in 13 different countries across Europe
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
North America Asia and Australia you can
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
see that the average maximums of
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
exposures were below even the most
 
01:08:15.529 --> 01:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
restrictive of the standards that are
 
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
recommended by some organizations or
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
countries that believe that the
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
non-thermal is what needs to be
 
01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.709 align:start position:0%
non-thermal is what needs to be
protected

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
I'll just make one other point and I'll
 
01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
close and that is that a vast majority
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
of individuals exposures that have cell
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
phones uh come from their cell phone
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
themselves maybe the Sprint has been
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
made before but the point I didn't hear
 
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:43.259 align:start position:0%
being made was that the amount of RF
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
energy that you or person staying next
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
to you gets from a wireless phone is
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
highly dependent on how strong the
 
01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
signal is from the nearest base station
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
and that can range from its maximum
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
output to more than a thousand times
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
less than that and when it's at its uh
 
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
farthest output it's when you have a
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
weak signal like one bar
 
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
but when you have good coverage and you
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
have a strong signal the phone reduces
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
its power uh to a specific level that
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
can be a thousand times less than the
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
maximum that it's capable of under the
 
01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:21.179 align:start position:0%
regulatory guidelines that are produced
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
by the FCC and so the bottom line is is
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
that if you want to reduce the vast
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
majority of public exposure from RF the
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
place to do it would be by having good
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
coverage low output from phones and and
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
that would have the largest potential
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
impact thank you
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mitch Berg Mr bushberg sorry
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh seeing no other questions thank you
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony I
 
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I think we're going to do
 
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
a slight deviation here because I would
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
like to have a I I know that
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
luiki thank you
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh would would like to speak on a
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
different idea and I'd like to save him
 
01:10:12.169 --> 01:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
for last if you will so we can
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
wrap it up there I'd like to call on
 
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.729 align:start position:0%
wrap it up there I'd like to call on
uh

01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
Susan Foster if she uh we okay CeCe
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak next please go
 
01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.189 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak next please go
ahead

01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
next go ahead
 
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:37.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
microphone please
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
you're here and and please speak clearly
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
and closely thank you um I don't mean to
 
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
disrupt the meeting I'm just um I'm
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic sensitive and so it's
 
01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:50.340 align:start position:0%
really difficult for me to be in this
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
room right now
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
um my name is Jen white I live in the
 
01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
Monadnock region of New Hampshire I gave
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
you my testimony I'm going to divert a
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
little bit and just speak from the heart
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
um so I um developed developed
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic sensitivity about 12
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
um I've been a small business owner for
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
about 20 years and through continued use
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
of Wireless technology I aim cell phone
 
01:11:15.169 --> 01:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
up to my head for you know basically 10
 
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
years every single day
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
um Wi-Fi in my home a smart meter on my
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
home and also a rad tower that was
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
behind our house at the time we lived in
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
Connecticut so behind our house on the
 
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
Yukon research facility property so in
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
close proximity to our home so basically
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
with all of that exposure I developed a
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
Sensitivity I didn't ask for this it
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
happened to me the gentleman that just
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier talked about you know
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
you're seeing two so you're hearing two
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
sides what's the reality I'm the reality
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is what happens when people are
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
exposed over the long term to Electro to
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
RF radiation
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
um you know I've always been very
 
01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
healthy I'm 47 years old now I developed
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
this when I was 35. I had always eaten
 
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.970 align:start position:0%
this when I was 35. I had always eaten
organic

01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:00.980 align:start position:0%
organic
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
exercised did everything right and
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
um you know I I developed this because I
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
was not given the opportunity to know
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
the evidence of what was happening to me
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
I found out the hard way
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
and so I'm here to plead with you to
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
consider HB 1644 on some level I know
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
that maybe you can't have the registry I
 
01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
know that maybe you need to call in
 
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
another committee to be here but for the
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
sake of people like myself who you know
 
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
really would love to be able to live a
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
normal life but now I'm unfortunately
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
not able to because this happened to me
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
and I don't want this to happen anybody
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
else this has literally changed my life
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
and not for the good
 
01:12:45.649 --> 01:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
um my husband and I recently went to our
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
15-year wedding anniversary we went to
 
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
an Airbnb in The Lakes region of New
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we checked into our Airbnb to
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
find out that it's a 5G Wi-Fi home
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
within an hour my body was literally
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
shaking because I couldn't be in that
 
01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.810 align:start position:0%
shaking because I couldn't be in that
environment

01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
thankfully we were able to unplug
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
everything and I was able to coexist and
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
enjoy my anniversary but these are
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
things that people like me cannot be
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
around and I'm just one of many but I'm
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
here to ask you to release and really
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
consider this because
 
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
I feel like you know I'm one that's
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
speaking up right now but this is
 
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
affecting so many people and it's only a
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
matter of time that this is going to
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
affect everybody in this room
 
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm just asking you to really really
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
consider this it would mean so much to
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
people like myself as I mentioned you
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
know this has affected my life I'm 47
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm not able to be in this room
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
right now without my body shaking
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and we appreciate
 
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
your concern and we do recognize that
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
people are having issues uh for whatever
 
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
reasons are out there no doubt about
 
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
that we have any questions from the
 
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.550 align:start position:0%
that we have any questions from the
community

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none uh you're that thank you
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
so much for your testimony thank you
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call on a second from last
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
year uh Miss Susan Foster if she's on
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
line I believe
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
Michael I'm here uh can you hear me
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
I uh we can hear you notice clearly as
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
the others and we don't see a picture
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
yet either
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
no there's no picture I
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
I woke up without a voice so I'm hoping
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
you can hear me okay go ahead
 
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:33.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
provider and an honorary firefighter
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
with the San Diego Fire Department
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to share a cautionary tale
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
review about firefighters of California
 
01:14:46.610 --> 01:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
and ask you to do everything in your
 
01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
and ask you to do everything in your
power

01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
all residents of New Hampshire with the
 
01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:53.340 align:start position:0%
most significant setbacks each City
 
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
entire legally a
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
fire stations have long been a desired
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
and early Target I'm sorry to interrupt
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry you're you're coming in a
 
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
little bit broken up is um is there
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
something you can do maybe closer to the
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
mic or or something
 
01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
I could give me a number I can call in
 
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
but this is
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
it it is not a good connection can we uh
 
01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:28.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the whole Community is having
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
a hard time understanding uh like every
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
other word
 
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
is there anything is there something
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:50.060 align:start position:0%
you could try that
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
yes I'm just gonna try to put you on
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
speaker and up with our microphone to
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
see if that helps them hear you a little
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
bit better so just one second
 
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.709 align:start position:0%
bit better so just one second
oh

01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay if you could turn off the mic to
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
your computer just mute yourself and
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
then use your landline let's see how
 
01:16:35.770 --> 01:16:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
okay hopefully you all can hear me
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
is that a go Jennifer are you guys able
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
this gives you a little amplification at
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
your Center
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
could you just um do a test again Susan
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay all right good morning my name is
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
yeah it's clear
 
01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:20.689 align:start position:0%
yeah it's clear
um

01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:24.620 align:start position:0%
okay Jennifer I couldn't hear Pat
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
all right good morning my name is Susan
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
Foster I am a medical writer and an
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
honorary firefighter with the San Diego
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
Fire Department
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to share a cautionary tale
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
with you about the firefighters of
 
01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:39.950 align:start position:0%
with you about the firefighters of
California

01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
California
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
and ask you to do everything in your
 
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
power to protect all residents of New
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the most significant
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
setbacks each City and town can legally
 
01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
setbacks each City and town can legally
obtain

01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
fire stations have long been desired and
 
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
an early Target of the of the
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications industry
 
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
industry favors fire stations as
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
locations because they are almost always
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
placed near population centers and
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
heavily traveled roadways
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
the Telecom industry wants to reach
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
people in their homes and on the road
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
Telecom has not had difficulty talking
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities into granting leases on
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
fire stations because the cities in town
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
to reap the revenue from these lead thus
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
firefighters who often work and sleep at
 
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
these stations have a substantial 24 7
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
exposure to cell towers that the
 
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
industry consistently promises our low
 
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
energy and one one thousandth of the
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
radiation the FCC allows
 
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
such reassurances rainfalls on
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters experience clusters of
 
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
neurological and immunological illnesses
 
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
after years of spending shift after
 
01:18:57.169 --> 01:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
shift in stations that are also home to
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
the Telecom industry's Towers
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
stance firefighters have taken in
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
California to keep 5G off their stations
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
should give every American family
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
heightened concern about the cell towers
 
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:14.060 align:start position:0%
that are creeping into their cities
 
01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
schools and neighborhoods often without
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
local control without notification and
 
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
without environmental review
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
the firefighters of California have have
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
spent 15 years and millions of dollars
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
fighting cell towers on their stations
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
let me explain how this started
 
01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
in 2004 I organized a specked brain scan
 
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:42.060 align:start position:0%
pilot study of firefighters who have
 
01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
been exposed to a cell tower on their
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
station for over five years we found
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
brain abnormalities in all firefighters
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
tested as a result of these findings I
 
01:19:57.649 --> 01:19:57.659 align:start position:0%
co-authored resolution 15 which passed
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly by the International
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
Association of firefighters resolution
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
urged more resolution 15
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
urged a moratorium on the placement of
 
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
cell towers on fire stations in the U.S
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
and Canada
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
that was trumped by the
 
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act but the spirit of
 
01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.790 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act but the spirit of
the

01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
resolution did educate
 
01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:26.060 align:start position:0%
in 2015 I helped the Los Angeles iaff
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
locals as they aligned with law
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement Union to fight first net
 
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
Towers on their stations I have assisted
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
with a cancer cluster in a fire station
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
in California with a wireless hub next
 
01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
door to their station in a station on
 
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
the East Coast with a cell tower
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
operating adjacent to the station I will
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
add that these were cancer clusters and
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
relatively young men with
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
non-presumptive Cancers meaning these
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
were not cancers typically related to
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
the profession of firefighting
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
let me tell you a little bit about why
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
the spec brain scan study came about
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
a group of 25 firefighters manned two
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
each with a single cell tower
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
the first Towers in town in the late
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
1990s there were three rotating shifts
 
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
every man worked for 24 hours every
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
other day
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
in one station Telecom had placed their
 
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
Tower directly in front of the station
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
it was beamed directly across the living
 
01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
quarters of the firefighters to reach 12
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
Lanes of traffic on the other side
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
the men
 
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
had been experiencing a range of
 
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
neurological symptoms since the towers
 
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
in front of their stations have been
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
activated five years earlier
 
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
all but two of the men experienced
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
neurological symptoms while working in
 
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
these two stations there's 23 out of 25
 
01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.330 align:start position:0%
these two stations there's 23 out of 25
men

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
men
 
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
the symptoms the men experienced were
 
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
identical to what we described as the
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
constellation of neurological symptoms
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
known as Electro sensitivity or EHS or
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
more technically electromagnetic
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
sensitivities EMS declared by the U.S
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
access board in 2002 to be a disability
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
EHS or EMS is not in itself a disease
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
but it is rather a term used to describe
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
multiple neurological and immunological
 
01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
conditions which are a result of the
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
body's inability to tolerate radio
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%

01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
the symptoms experienced by the
 
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
firefighters who participated in the
 
01:22:48.649 --> 01:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
specked brain scan study were similar to
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
firefighters in other stations who live
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the shadow of cell count
 
01:22:56.270 --> 01:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
yeah specific to the men we studied it
 
01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
is important to note that all the men
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
had passed rigorous physical and
 
01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
cognitive exams prior to being hired by
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
the fire department
 
01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
their symptoms included headaches
 
01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:12.980 align:start position:0%
extreme fatigue cognitive impairment
 
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
anesthesia-like sleep where the men woke
 
01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.010 align:start position:0%
anesthesia-like sleep where the men woke
up

01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
for 9-1-1 calls as if they had been
 
01:23:19.199 --> 01:23:20.630 align:start position:0%
for 9-1-1 calls as if they had been
drugged

01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
drugged
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%

symptoms

01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
real life examples of these symptoms are
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
best briefly characterized by first the
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
firefighters got lost on 9-1-1 calls and
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
the town they had grown up in on several
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
occasions in one instance four
 
01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
firefighters died in the rig in a stupor
 
01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
with the alarm sounding in the
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
background unable to remember how to
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
start the engine
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
medic with 20 years of experience who
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
had never made a mistake forgot basic
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
CPR in the midst of resubstituting a
 
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
coronary victim
 
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
the brain scans of these six men
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
revealed a pervasive hyper excitability
 
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
of the neurons in certain parts of the
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
brain these findings suggest the
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
exposure to RF or micro microwave
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
radiation was causing the neurons to
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
continually fire in these areas without
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
benefit of rest
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
when brain cells cannot rest they
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately die
 
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
the scans further revealed that other
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
sections of the brain that should have
 
01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
been functional showed hypoperfusion or
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
decreased blood flow suggesting
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
impairment in these particular areas
 
01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:45.410 align:start position:0%
impairment in these particular areas
foreign

01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
you have heard and you are going to
 
01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
continue to hear from industry
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives repeatedly that
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
non-thermal levels of RF radiation from
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
cell towers do not cause harm as they
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
are below the regulatory guidelines
 
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
offered by the FCC
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
if you can remember one thing that I
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
tell you this morning I want you to
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
remember that the tower in front of the
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
station causing the greatest harm to the
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters measured at 1 1000 of what
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
the FCC allows one one thousand
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
the firefighter's most important lesson
 
01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:26.219 align:start position:0%
to US state legislators and as a nation
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
may be that if we allow a build out of
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
cell tower such that they are common in
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
place in front of homes and schools as
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
they know are on fire stations we may be
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
facing a tsunami of neurological
 
01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.490 align:start position:0%
facing a tsunami of neurological
symptoms

01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
symptoms
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
forms of neurological damage I worry
 
01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
about the most are cognitive impairment
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
and learning disabilities for children
 
01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
and for adults early onset dementia and
 
01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease
 
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
the rate of people dying from
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease in the U.S Rose by
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
55 over a 15-year period according to uh
 
01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
new relatively new information from the
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
CDC the direct and indirect costs to the
 
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
state for Alzheimer's and a host of
 
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
related neurological and immunological
 
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
diseases could be catastrophic for New
 
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:21.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the country as a whole
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
clearly the state of California honored
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
the sacrifice of its firefighters and
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
its concern about the help that they
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
face from cell towers having granted an
 
01:26:36.370 --> 01:26:36.380 align:start position:0%
exemption to them in ab57 SB 649 and
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
ab-57 which passed recently was signed
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
into law by Governor Newsom on October
 
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
4th 2021.
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
these exemptions allow the firefighters
 
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
to fight the towers without the onerous
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
burden of the shot clock and make it
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
very difficult for telecoms to place 5G
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
on their station
 
01:26:59.450 --> 01:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
yet think about this exemptions for
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
firefighters the strongest of the strong
 
01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
Among Us on some residential areas have
 
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
zero setbacks from residential
 
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:09.780 align:start position:0%
if the government of California
 
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that firefighters cannot do
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
their jobs quickly and efficiently such
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
that the safety of the people and
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
property of firefighters protect may be
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
compromised what have the legislators
 
01:27:25.729 --> 01:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
been told that the rest of society is
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
not privy to
 
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
firefighters have fought to keep cell
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
towers off their stations because they
 
01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
know they are among the strongest of the
 
01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
strong when it comes to the
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
professionals among us yet they have
 
01:27:41.209 --> 01:27:41.219 align:start position:0%
suffered harm living and working in the
 
01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:43.020 align:start position:0%
presence of cell towers and the
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
firefighters know they cannot carry out
 
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
their duties to protect the general
 
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
public as they should if they are indeed
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
impaired further they know that
 
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
that people they protect the general
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
public are almost certainly more
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable than they are logic tells us
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
that the firefighters the strongest of
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
the strong are harmed and the weakest
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
and most vulnerable Among Us are at even
 
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
greater risk
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
now I will quickly address buyers I have
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
worked with Scott McCullough in
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
California for two years exploring
 
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
causes of these horrific fires we have
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
found in Southern California alone four
 
01:28:30.169 --> 01:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
major wildfires in the last 15 years
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
have started in whole or in part by
 
01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:36.860 align:start position:0%
telecommunications equipment
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
these Telecom start initiated fires have
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
caused multiple lives and over six
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in Damages
 
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
I will add one final comment
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
in the late 1990s Dr bushberg from whom
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
you just heard approved the cell tower
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
at the fire station where we found brain
 
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:00.780 align:start position:0%
damage and every firefighter we tested
 
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
he assured the Town Council of the
 
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
safety of the towers that caused brain
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
damage as proven unspect brain scans
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
and even though cancer is not my area of
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
expertise I will add that the world
 
01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
can't report that Dr bushberg reference
 
01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
is not a systematic review of the cancer
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
sign thank you very much
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for your
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
testimony do we
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
does the committee have any questions uh
 
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
before I go down we're we're trying to
 
01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
ascertain right now there is a question
 
01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not because uh he also
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
sits on the Science and Tech committee
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh brisney would be on
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee we're trying to
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
ascertain that right now so
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
um apparently there's a terminology term
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
that we're exploring right now so uh
 
01:29:53.629 --> 01:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't make that much of a difference
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of overall work but we want to
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that that we get a correct
 
01:30:01.490 --> 01:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
um so with that being said any questions
 
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
very good information there uh we're
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
going to move on uh we have limited time
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
left so I'm going to call on
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki who would like to
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
speak on an idea that uh that he'd like
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
to present and then after that
 
01:30:24.890 --> 01:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
presentation the committee will go into
 
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
a brief discussion on what we're going
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
to do don't forget CC wanted maybe give
 
01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:31.930 align:start position:0%
to do don't forget CC wanted maybe give

oh I'm sorry see I'm Excuse me I I got
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
those names confused in that case would
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%

gentleman who was here speaking
 
01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
presumably on behalf of himself I just
 
01:31:12.169 --> 01:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
checked with him he is a paid expert
 
01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
from ctia the wireless industry
 
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:18.540 align:start position:0%

brief paragraph she is the mother who
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
was here speaking with her daughter from

daughter Amelia could not be here today
 
01:31:37.729 --> 01:31:37.739 align:start position:0%
although they testified last time as the

01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
the cell tower must cease and desist
 
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
operations immediately as their homes
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%

they did

item 21 on page 10 this board has
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
reviewed Professor Swanson's
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
presentation and discussion because he
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
spoke to their board as well and finds
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
Professor Swanson's conclusions several
 
01:33:22.490 --> 01:33:22.500 align:start position:0%
of which are strident and absolute to
 
01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
lack credibility a major problem with
 
01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:28.139 align:start position:0%
Professor Swanson is that he speaks as a
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
purported expert about matters of human
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
health and disease and medical and
 
01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%

effects of exposure to wireless
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
radiation but he lacks any academic or
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
professional qualifications in this
 
01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:43.850 align:start position:0%
professional qualifications in this
field

field
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
Professor Swanson is a professor of
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
theoretical physics Professor Swanson's
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
research interests focus on esoteric
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
topics in nuclear physics cosmology
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
hadronic physics especially in learning
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
how quarks and gluons build the universe
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
all 124 Professor Swanson's published
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
scientific studies are limited to these
 
01:34:12.169 --> 01:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
subject areas Professor Swanson is not a
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
medical doctor Professor Swanson has no
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
professional training or qualifications
 
01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:20.780 align:start position:0%

Environmental Studies Public Health
 
01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
epidemiology or toxicology and his
 
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
professional credentials show no such
 
01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.010 align:start position:0%
professional credentials show no such
expertise

01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
yet Professor Swanson rejects more than
 
01:34:38.209 --> 01:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
2 000 peer-reviewed scientific studies
 
01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
showing that wireless radiation May or
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
does negatively impact human health as
 
01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:47.420 align:start position:0%
outliers by Fringe scientists who may be
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorists with an ax to grind
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
and assert that their studies all show
 
01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:55.860 align:start position:0%
confirmation bias Professor Swanson
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
asserts unequivocally that the
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
scientific consensus is that wireless
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
radiation cannot cause human harm
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
the board finds that Professor Swanson
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
lacks the qualifications and expertise
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
to make such sweeping statements and his
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
credibility as a witness is severely
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
undermined hereby in item 23 on page 11
 
01:35:22.129 --> 01:35:22.139 align:start position:0%
they continue the Verizon Wireless also
 
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
submitted to this board documents which
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
consist primarily of self-promotional
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
brochures and industry-funded advocacy
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
pieces rather than peer-reviewed
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
scientific literature so thank you to
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
the Pittsfield Board of Health for
 
01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
clarifying that the industry brings
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
forward supposed experts who are not
 
01:35:47.209 --> 01:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
qualified to weigh in on this issue I
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
would like to thank the New Hampshire
 
01:35:50.689 --> 01:35:50.699 align:start position:0%
commission that investigated the health
 
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
and environmental impacts of today's
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
Wireless technology
 
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
they composed a commission of Highly
 
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:01.139 align:start position:0%
qualified experts and they document the
 
01:36:01.139 --> 01:36:03.250 align:start position:0%
qualified experts and they document the
peer-reviewed

01:36:03.250 --> 01:36:03.260 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed
 
01:36:05.689 --> 01:36:05.699 align:start position:0%
non-industry-funded science in this
 
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
document that is in your hands today so
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
please go back to your own experts who
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
have done their due diligence but mostly
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
I want to speak about Solutions
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
I am honored to be a co-founder are you
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
into your last minute or so of uh yeah
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
summary what I want to do is give you an
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
assurance that there are so many
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
resources at your fingertip for
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
education I have helped to found a
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit out of Europe called Wireless
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
education where we have literally
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf courses that could be
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
administered to schools and families in
 
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
about a half an hour online
 
01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:45.659 align:start position:0%
for those who want to address the
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
municipal level Reinventing wires
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
teaches our towns the many reasons why
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
Wireless is no longer the preferred
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
choice for connectivity fiber to and
 
01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
through the premises
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
and then for our schools we have a whole
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
tool kit with tech safe schools that we
 
01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:03.830 align:start position:0%
tool kit with tech safe schools that we
can

01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
um bring to you you don't have to do
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
this on there on your own even the U.S
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
collaborative for high performance
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
schools already has a module for new
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation on how to
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
make an EMF safe environment there are
 
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
green School certifying organization the
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
hartsburg School in Massachusetts has
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
already gone hardwired they put a switch
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
on the wall with a timer you only use
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi for the minimum amount of time and
 
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
you use hardwired connections throughout
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
the building
 
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
and the amazing film generation Zapped
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have done screenings in stratum we
 
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
have done screenings in Keene we can get
 
01:37:47.050 --> 01:37:47.060 align:start position:0%
out and educate at the community level
 
01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
and again folks this is not rocket
 
01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
science plug in your technology and turn
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
off the wireless antennas you will have
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
a much safer connection you will have a
 
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:02.340 align:start position:0%
screaming fast signal it won't drop like
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
Wireless signals do and hardwired
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
solutions consume 10 times less energy
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
than the wireless cloud and all of its
 
01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
distribution centers so thank you very
 
01:38:15.179 --> 01:38:16.610 align:start position:0%
distribution centers so thank you very
much

01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for your
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
presentations again always a pleasure to
 
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
see you here uh I have a I I don't have
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
any questions as the committee oh by the
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
way I I want to clarify uh I guess as
 
01:38:31.970 --> 01:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
the as the chair of the subcommittee uh
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
I I have the authority to appoint
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative bresney to be a member of
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee which is right but
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's because he is a member of the
 
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
Science and Tech committee I can do that
 
01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
I cannot do that for members that are
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
not part of the Science and Tech
 
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
committee so that explanation was just
 
01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
given to me any questions from our
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members at all
 
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much oops yeah let
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
seeking an opinion from you
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I mean you're I think the foregone
 
01:39:09.169 --> 01:39:09.179 align:start position:0%
conclusion that you would say is that
 
01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
telecommunications uh paid Consultants
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
on the national level have an advantage
 
01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
over municipalities advancing FCC
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
regulations in favor of the industry
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
yes so a follow-up on that would be
 
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
we are speaking right now about trying
 
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
to get municipalities involved both in
 
01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
educational level and on the zoning
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
level to
 
01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
um increase their voice in where these
 
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
Soul towers are placed uh
 
01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:40.669 align:start position:0%
Soul towers are placed uh
not

01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
is that the most effective use of our
 
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
time and strategy in order to get
 
01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities involved I think as
 
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative abrami mentioned at the
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
opening of this meeting if you are to
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
take courageous action two directions
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful to the general
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
public one let's get the education out
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
there because they've only been told by
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
industry that all Wi-Fi all the time is
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
the way to go and during the pandemic we
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
handed every student every child
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
a wireless device to go home and access
 
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
their education with not one shred of
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
training to just say run the ethernet
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
cable to the device go into the device
 
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
and turn off all the antennas now you
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
can safely access your education so we
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
desperately need the education to the
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
general public secondly if we do not
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
update our zoning bylaws town by town
 
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
then the industry is going to continue
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
to come in and promote the financial
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue they'll receive from putting
 
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
technology in at the curb that's
 
01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
radiating your citizens so I think you
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
need to get the education out there and
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
I think you need to get zoning bylaws in
 
01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
place that protect within the framework
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
of the existing FCC law because
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise as we're seeing they are
 
01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:03.659 align:start position:0%
putting these cell towers 10 feet from
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
people's homes I was in Minneapolis
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I did a generation zap
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
screening there
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
and there is a woman who has multiple
 
01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:14.090 align:start position:0%
and there is a woman who has multiple
sclerosis

01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
sclerosis
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
the neighbors were all working from home
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
they see a truck pull up with a big long
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
pole on it 20 neighbors went outside and
 
01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
said what are we doing and they said
 
01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:27.260 align:start position:0%
we're installing a 5G small cell antenna
 
01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
10 feet from This Woman's bedroom
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
the residents 20 of them came out
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
because they're all working from home
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
and said oh no we don't want this here
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
and so the installer called the police
 
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:45.020 align:start position:0%
the police came and said well actually
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
with First Amendment rights they have
 
01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
every right to be out here peaceably
 
01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:51.370 align:start position:0%
every right to be out here peaceably
Gathering

01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:51.380 align:start position:0%
Gathering
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
so the police sent the guy away they've
 
01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
come back now twice and every time the
 
01:41:59.870 --> 01:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
neighbors get out there to very
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
peacefully protest
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
and every time a higher level of police
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
has come the sergeant the captain and
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
every time they have protected the
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
citizens rights to be there and they
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
have learned that if there are people or
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
cars there these installers cannot
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
install these because it's a high risk
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
if there are people there so let that be
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
a word of encouragement to anybody in
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
your community if you see these coming
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
in because they are in and they are
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
coming Fast and Furious before the
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
industry is made to stop we believe and
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
as attorney Scott McAuliffe believes you
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
have the power to provide your
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities with information on how
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
legally today they can start updating
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
their zoning bylaws because if you don't
 
01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:52.139 align:start position:0%
have it in your zoning code you're a
 
01:42:56.090 --> 01:42:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you okay with that being said I'd
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
like to invite uh thank you very much
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I'd like to invite
 
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Loki lewicky to give his
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
views on some alternative ideas
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to just give a little bit
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
of background
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I have spent most of my life working
 
01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
as an electrical engineer I first became
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
acquainted with a spectrum analyzer
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
around 55 years ago and I have heard a
 
01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
lot of talk about
 
01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:27.109 align:start position:0%
lot of talk about
um

01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:27.119 --> 01:43:29.470 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:33.010 --> 01:43:33.020 align:start position:0%
wireless being just a monolithic thing
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I say is the dose
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
makes the poison just for comparative
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
purposes I counted up and we have
 
01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
approximately this is the actual
 
01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:44.699 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic radiation in this room
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
right now we have approximately 60
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
fluorescent bulbs if they're 100 watts
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
each that's 6000 watts of power coming
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
from them most of it is visible light
 
01:43:57.470 --> 01:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
some of it is uh infrared we have two
 
01:43:59.050 --> 01:43:59.060 align:start position:0%
white things over there on the wall
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
we've climbed up got the numbers on them
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
these are wireless
 
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
transceivers and they are from memory 12
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
watts each which is one 250th of the
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
total power in this room
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
I also make a habit of visiting um
 
01:44:19.729 --> 01:44:19.739 align:start position:0%
tower sites and so forth and look at the
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
name plates on the emergency generators
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
and a large cell phone tower will have a
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
50 to 100
 
01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:28.090 align:start position:0%
50 to 100
um

01:44:28.090 --> 01:44:28.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
kilowatt generator attached so what
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
you've got here is we've got 25 watts
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
6000 watts and on a big cell phone
 
01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
installation 50 000 to 100 000 Watts and
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
so we've got artists of magnitude
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
difference and once again the dose makes
 
01:44:49.129 --> 01:44:49.139 align:start position:0%
the poison and the other thing is don't
 
01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
be stupid I heard an anecdote of someone
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
where they had a kid in the dorm room
 
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
and they had one of these things right
 
01:44:58.370 --> 01:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
at close to the head of the bed you know
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
don't be stupid it's you don't need to
 
01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh get any more exposure than necessary
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
but given that dosage differences the
 
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
power differences it makes sense to me
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
to have standards based upon power and
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
possibly on frequencies used which I
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
have heard no information whatsoever on
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of talk from
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
authorities and everybody's got their
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
own set of authorities and the argument
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
from Authority is a logical fallacy
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
which means it's not something that's
 
01:45:28.609 --> 01:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
very convincing
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest is that we
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the big cell phone
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
towers and smaller ones if we have a de
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
minimum standard which might be man this
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
is pulling numbers out of the Hat it's
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
not anything uh definitive but if we say
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
100 watts and 100 feet of separation
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
from a normally inhabited building
 
01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
is would be one standard and then for
 
01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
the big towers we could have a much
 
01:45:58.129 --> 01:45:58.139 align:start position:0%
greater standard and it's not going to
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
satisfy whatever we do will not satisfy
 
01:46:02.330 --> 01:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
everyone but if we do have that dual
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
standard and I don't think we'd ought to
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
try to have Define the standards in
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
watts per square centimeter or something
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
like that because that just opened the
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
door to a whole lot of uh you know
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
concern and discussion and uh haggling
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
but if for instance if we put in the
 
01:46:19.129 --> 01:46:19.139 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations or if we put it in
 
01:46:21.729 --> 01:46:21.739 align:start position:0%
Statewide you know 100 Watts 100 feet
 
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
anything beyond that a longer larger
 
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
standard and once again I have still not
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
been convinced by any of the testifiers
 
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
that this is the right thing or the
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
wrong thing to do but I think it is
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
something we might be able to legislate
 
01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
and might be something that we can
 
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
reasonably compromise on until we have
 
01:46:42.649 --> 01:46:42.659 align:start position:0%
additional data
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
that's all I have
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you what when we
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
gave up and this is when we gave up
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
control of the Telecommunications
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
industry as a state
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
because we no longer can go to the puc
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
how do we legislate that I believe it
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
has to be on a local level that has to
 
01:47:14.590 --> 01:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
um as a techie I'm talking about the
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
technical issues
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the legal issues and how it might be
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
implemented are outside of my purview I
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
found it kind of interesting that we
 
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
spent the first 45 minutes listening to
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers and we've had very little talk
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
on the technical issues
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
um but if we set something perhaps it
 
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
would not even be in statute how we
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
address this whether it should be in
 
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
statute whether it should be by uh
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation and how it would be
 
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
implemented as outside of my purview I'm
 
01:47:53.209 --> 01:47:53.219 align:start position:0%
just saying you know if we can agree on
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
a dual standard with a diminishment
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
level for things that can be scattered
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
around for
 
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
um at a particular shorter distance and
 
01:48:01.739 --> 01:48:02.450 align:start position:0%
um at a particular shorter distance and
then

01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
um you know have the standard for the
 
01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
higher level power levels and this would
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
end up effectively being
 
01:48:13.209 --> 01:48:13.219 align:start position:0%
um you know a watch per square meter
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
standard but with just two levels
 
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:20.629 align:start position:0%
standard but with just two levels
allowed

01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
represent broski
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question on
 
01:48:29.689 --> 01:48:29.699 align:start position:0%
page 22 slide 44 this is the art review
 
01:48:32.689 --> 01:48:32.699 align:start position:0%
RF safety and wireless uh communication
 
01:48:34.189 --> 01:48:34.199 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
01:48:37.609 --> 01:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
there's a diagram here that shows as the
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
distance grows between the user and the
 
01:48:42.169 --> 01:48:42.179 align:start position:0%
cell tower the RF output goes to its
 
01:48:46.129 --> 01:48:46.139 align:start position:0%
maximum and as a distance reduces the RF
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
output is at its minimum so can you
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
speak to Inc to having these setbacks
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
are they counterproductive or or how
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
does that um how does it cancel out by
 
01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
having a larger setback thank you that
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
seems counterintuitive to me everything
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
obeys to some extent the cube squared
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
law or you know the surface of a sphere
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
at a specific distance tells how much uh
 
01:49:13.450 --> 01:49:13.460 align:start position:0%
um the area
 
01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
slow down a bit how many watts per unit
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
of area we might have and uh it if the
 
01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:24.659 align:start position:0%
power is not at the source then the
 
01:49:26.209 --> 01:49:26.219 align:start position:0%
power cannot be radiated that just
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense
 
01:49:30.770 --> 01:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
um and so we know that they have
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
directional antennas we know that the
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
power is not all radiated in a sphere
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's they obviously try to have the
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
radiated power go to where the users are
 
01:49:45.050 --> 01:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
however I don't think that they can
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
repeal something as simple as the cube
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
I guess just to confirm so does this is
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
do you agree with this slide that the
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
farther the user is from the tower that
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
the more radiation there is thank you no
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
I disagree it in certain cases that
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
won't be so if for instance the um
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
the antenna is not radiating down below
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
you could conceivably be at the base of
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
the Tower and have very little radiation
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
but if um the antenna is broadcasting
 
01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
you know one would expect to have it be
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
somewhat cylindrical for something that
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
is a broadcast antenna as one increases
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
the distance then the power will go down
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
um although you know conceding that the
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
power at the pace of the towel may be
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
I have a question from an individual
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
strengthened because of the distance
 
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
from the tower so
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what that means but
 
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
there may be a separation between what's
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
animating from the tower itself
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
difference between the powers and
 
01:51:30.649 --> 01:51:30.659 align:start position:0%
energies being involved
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
that there's the device that's receiving
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
it and emanating there's the device
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's sending it pen emanating and
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
these are two different factors and then
 
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
we're always talking about sort of one
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
set of person in our phone when you get
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
into a room of people who are all on
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
their cell phones and there's you know
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
seven different signals aiming into
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
everything every single person's phone
 
01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
this is also a part of a cumulative
 
01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
effect and so uh that would be something
 
01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:03.970 align:start position:0%
effect and so uh that would be something
to

01:52:03.970 --> 01:52:03.980 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
consider I think when you're talking
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
about whether the signal would be weaker
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
the farther away or stronger the closer
 
01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.030 align:start position:0%
the farther away or stronger the closer
up

01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
um so you need to separate which signals
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and then the
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
cumulative output of all of these
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
that does make sense however we're here
 
01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
today to talk about cell phone towers
 
01:52:38.209 --> 01:52:38.219 align:start position:0%
um what the other effects may be are
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
outside of our purview and outside of my
 
01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:41.570 align:start position:0%
outside of our purview and outside of my
knowledge

01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to I just say uh we uh we don't
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
want to start getting into into the
 
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
weeds here that was not the purpose of
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
of this meeting today
 
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
um the as I said at the beginning of the
 
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
meeting we were here to determine
 
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
whether or not we think there is or is
 
01:52:57.780 --> 01:52:58.970 align:start position:0%
whether or not we think there is or is
not

01:52:58.970 --> 01:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:53:03.649 --> 01:53:03.659 align:start position:0%
a way to uh to have further legislation
 
01:53:08.770 --> 01:53:08.780 align:start position:0%
forthcoming or or not uh I will get to
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative partial for one last
 
01:53:13.609 --> 01:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
comment before we I go to my summary
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
this is the very short one thank you so
 
01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony makes various
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
good sense and it does get in the weeds
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
I agree but your name for the record
 
01:53:27.129 --> 01:53:27.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further provided
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I'm going to uh go into a
 
01:53:37.129 --> 01:53:37.139 align:start position:0%
deliberation here with our subcommittee
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
members I will say that
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
We Have Heard
 
01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:43.139 align:start position:0%
both sides
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh over the course of several well over
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
a year two years
 
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and I would like to hear from my
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members what their thoughts
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
are on whether or not for whatever
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
reason if there should be some for some
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
type of legislation moving forward
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
however general or where it's directed
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
may be we're not here to solve the
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
problem right now we're here to
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
determine you know we either let the
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
subject die by saying there's no further
 
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
legislation required or we say that
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
there is some basis for further uh
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislation we're not quite sure what it
 
01:54:24.530 --> 01:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
might be but it might cover this area so
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
I like to hear some thoughts from my
 
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
you're free to speak represent Kelly
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
Pitts would you like to go first
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
oh sure since
 
01:54:36.659 --> 01:54:38.209 align:start position:0%
oh sure since
um

01:54:38.209 --> 01:54:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think there is
 
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
a place for further legislation and I
 
01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
think that for the legislation has to do
 
01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
with education and that was something I
 
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
was going to work on and I think it's
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
still necessary
 
01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
form a resolution maybe a concurrent
 
01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:03.709 align:start position:0%
form a resolution maybe a concurrent
resolution

01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
or a bill with a very strong suggestion
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
that information be disseminated to the
 
01:55:11.699 --> 01:55:13.070 align:start position:0%
that information be disseminated to the
towns

01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
we get the information we get all these
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh people coming and talking to us and
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's great but some of the small towns
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
don't have that and the counties don't
 
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
have that I think all the information
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
pro and con needs to be disseminated and
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
disseminated quickly I think this should
 
01:55:35.149 --> 01:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
be a bill with priority
 
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
we can't mandate that it be done but we
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
can strongly suggest that it be done and
 
01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
by done done with the companies who are
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
investing in this technology and I also
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
believe that the companies who are
 
01:55:53.330 --> 01:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
investing in this technology
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not it's going to
 
01:55:59.570 --> 01:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
happen but we should know where it is
 
01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
and be able to get that information if
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
we have to on a foia on a 91a we need to
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
know where these towers are going up
 
01:56:11.090 --> 01:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
where these attachments are going up
 
01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:12.590 align:start position:0%
where these attachments are going up
and

01:56:12.590 --> 01:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's the only way we can judge if it's
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
making a difference in what we are doing
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
or seeing so I I believe that that kind
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
of legislation needs to come forth thank
 
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:25.010 align:start position:0%
of legislation needs to come forth thank
you

01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
just yeah just uh your friend my final
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
thought yes I mean I agree with the
 
01:56:41.169 --> 01:56:41.179 align:start position:0%
education part
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing is that to come up
 
01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
with a model model ordinance for our
 
01:56:50.410 --> 01:56:50.420 align:start position:0%
towns to consider
 
01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:54.179 align:start position:0%
that would cut mustard mustard with with
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
the FCC would not violate the federal
 
01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.550 align:start position:0%
the FCC would not violate the federal
law

01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:57:01.930 --> 01:57:01.940 align:start position:0%
is something I'm willing to put forward
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
to help our communities
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
to you know like that last story we
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
heard about the whole you know the whole
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
street came out to protect one woman
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
there's something you know and I know
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony both ways on the
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
science I mean we've heard it both ways
 
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:18.830 align:start position:0%
science I mean we've heard it both ways
but

01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
and look I'm not I'm not an extremist
 
01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
you know you guys know me
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
I but I just I keep on coming back to
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that I've heard for a year and
 
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
a half in the commission that we had a
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony a lot of testimony on
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
and that's why I bought legislation
 
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
because there's clearly there's
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
something here and I'm not convinced
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
that the federal government is doing its
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
job either
 
01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm saying let's let's
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
Empower at least Empower our communities
 
01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
to have a line of defense if they choose
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
to have have one leave it up to the
 
01:57:56.089 --> 01:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
communities to to make that but I think
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
the state can help by
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh kind of blessing
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
I uh an ordinance model that would would
 
01:58:09.709 --> 01:58:09.719 align:start position:0%
uh again because every Community does
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
not have the resource to come up with a
 
01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.659 align:start position:0%
good ordinance and uh that would
 
01:58:15.659 --> 01:58:16.970 align:start position:0%
good ordinance and uh that would
withstand

01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
withstand
 
01:58:20.770 --> 01:58:20.780 align:start position:0%
the the fcc's you know the 1996 uh
 
01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
telecommunication Act
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I think that's something that we can
 
01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.250 align:start position:0%
so I think that's something that we can
do

01:58:25.250 --> 01:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
and I I certainly would be working on
 
01:58:27.599 --> 01:58:28.390 align:start position:0%
and I I certainly would be working on
that

01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:31.010 --> 01:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that this committee
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
would would support that and as far as
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
the comment earlier about should it be
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
should we get the municipal involved
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
with this precedent for that we had one
 
01:58:43.609 --> 01:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
Casino Bill years ago when the casino
 
01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
bills were still were financed and and
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means work together on on on
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
going through that bill
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
so there there is that's a matter of
 
01:58:55.729 --> 01:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
talking to the speaker uh uh whoever
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
that may be uh as to uh how to handle
 
01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
such a bill okay thank you
 
01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh again so what I'm hearing
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
from our committee is that there is um a
 
01:59:11.689 --> 01:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
a desire to to make a recommendation
 
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
that some form of legislation can uh
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
should be done on the subject matter
 
01:59:20.570 --> 01:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
um I think it should center around
 
01:59:22.850 --> 01:59:22.860 align:start position:0%
what's representative Kelly Pitts said
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
on education uh uh we uh we we don't
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to recommend whether
 
01:59:31.129 --> 01:59:31.139 align:start position:0%
it's a resolution or a bill we just have
 
01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
to recommend that there is some form of
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislation required and we can make a
 
01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation on
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
um the it the the the areas that we
 
01:59:42.169 --> 01:59:42.179 align:start position:0%
would like to see it explored like
 
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
education perhaps
 
01:59:48.410 --> 01:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
um and uh and to um and also the things
 
01:59:51.890 --> 01:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
that would enable uh communities to
 
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.179 align:start position:0%
pursue their um I guess you know zoning
 
01:59:57.169 --> 01:59:57.179 align:start position:0%
changes and and things like that is that
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
the general feeling from the committee
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
I I don't disagree oh sorry I don't
 
02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:06.709 align:start position:0%
I I don't disagree oh sorry I don't
disagree

02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
um I we're still in the situation where
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:00:13.070 --> 02:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think we really need to talk about the
 
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
technical issues and unfortunately we
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten the kind of information
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'd be interested in it was the
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
professor from UNH and I said let's get
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
a spectrum analyzer drive around and see
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
what we see and we don't have that
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
information we could be in a very hot
 
02:00:31.669 --> 02:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
spot here we could be a hundred yards
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
away and be in a very cold spot and I
 
02:00:36.010 --> 02:00:36.020 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:00:39.169 --> 02:00:39.179 align:start position:0%
uh we can certainly add the technical
 
02:00:41.689 --> 02:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
aspects to our recommendation as far as
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
the types of things that some further
 
02:00:46.370 --> 02:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
study might include I had a conversation
 
02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
yesterday with uh chairman Vose and he
 
02:00:52.370 --> 02:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
was in agreement that we can put in uh
 
02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
whatever uh areas of interest that
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
further legislation could cover doesn't
 
02:00:59.810 --> 02:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be specific it can
 
02:01:02.089 --> 02:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
be General it can be wide encompassing
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
just something to give an idea of what
 
02:01:06.169 --> 02:01:06.179 align:start position:0%
type of legislation we might be looking
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
at so so I would agree with that
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
the chair can I kind of just react to
 
02:01:14.510 --> 02:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
that so I I would support that
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
Department in the commission when we we
 
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
talked about these things we did we
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
talked about everything
 
02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:23.219 align:start position:0%
and in that the problem was that doing
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
the measurements around the state
 
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
would cost money
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
and and knowing our legislature
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
you know where's that money coming from
 
02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
do we mandate that the industry do
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
measurements perhaps
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh obviously they're going to they would
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
resist that but you you would think you
 
02:01:44.089 --> 02:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
would think that somebody does
 
02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
measurements right
 
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
and and I would say no one does
 
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
measurements and uh so
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know I would support measurements
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
but the issue becomes and then what time
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
of day where what direction
 
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
does beam forming there's all this other
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
stuff that you got to worry about
 
02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know it does get complicated from a
 
02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:09.719 align:start position:0%
science standpoint
 
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
again understanding the purpose of this
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is to make a recommendation
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
on whether or not we there should be
 
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
some legislation whether or not there's
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
there's a mandate or whether or not
 
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
there is funds involved would be the
 
02:02:25.850 --> 02:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
subject of whatever Bill someone might
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
present later on which would open up a
 
02:02:28.139 --> 02:02:28.850 align:start position:0%
present later on which would open up a
whole

02:02:28.850 --> 02:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
new window of opportunity for
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
testimonies and discussions on that
 
02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:35.810 align:start position:0%
testimonies and discussions on that
representative

02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
thank you I in my opinion I don't think
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's necessary for us to make any
 
02:02:42.649 --> 02:02:42.659 align:start position:0%
recommendations because
 
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
um if you've been in the legislature
 
02:02:46.189 --> 02:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
long enough you know that some bills
 
02:02:48.649 --> 02:02:48.659 align:start position:0%
come back every year I can give an
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
example not to go off on a tangent too
 
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
far but when I was a freshman legislator
 
02:02:57.649 --> 02:02:57.659 align:start position:0%
in 2011 I spent a long time trying to
 
02:02:57.659 --> 02:02:58.629 align:start position:0%
in 2011 I spent a long time trying to
find

02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
find
 
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
when a certain pet was was banned and I
 
02:03:04.729 --> 02:03:04.739 align:start position:0%
couldn't find anything but one thing I
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
did see over and over and over again was
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
every term there was a bill for hemp
 
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Owen he put that bill in
 
02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
every every term some some of you might
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
have been here long enough to remember
 
02:03:16.370 --> 02:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
that and then and then there's other
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
other bills no matter what the subject
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
is you can almost guarantee that
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to put in a bill about
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
it so I don't see this being any
 
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
different I'm sure somebody will put in
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
a bill next term
 
02:03:30.890 --> 02:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
for for 5G technology and antennas and
 
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
and all that so
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary for us to vote on
 
02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
anything today
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
well I I
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
would need to vote on something today
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
because representative bows is having an
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
executive session on October the 6th and
 
02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh the recommendations of this committee
 
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
today will be the subject of their of
 
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
the full of the full committee vote and
 
02:03:58.010 --> 02:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
he has to get a report in before a time
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
period so that's where function today is
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
to make a vote on whether we are not to
 
02:04:05.450 --> 02:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
go forward or not I would say my opinion
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
whether we do or don't make a
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation here you're right there
 
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
will be other bills that will be
 
02:04:15.530 --> 02:04:15.540 align:start position:0%
submitted I'm I'm positive of that
 
02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
um but the recommendation of this
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee could add some Credence to
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:23.229 align:start position:0%
whether or not
um

02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:26.089 --> 02:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
not in support of those bills per se but
 
02:04:27.649 --> 02:04:27.659 align:start position:0%
it would add Credence to the fact that
 
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
some legislation still needs to to go on
 
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
because we feel there is something
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
something out there we can't put a cause
 
02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
on it but we feel that if if we say no
 
02:04:42.649 --> 02:04:42.659 align:start position:0%
legislation is required here my opinion
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
is that it would seem that the committee
 
02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
was saying there is no further
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
discussion required on this subject at
 
02:04:50.689 --> 02:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
all I'm not quite sure I agree with that
 
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
whereas if we say there is legislation
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
required uh in general terms we're
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that something is out
 
02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
there something may have to get done and
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're saying that we're we're opening
 
02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
the doors to any other legislation that
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
might come forward that might help with
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
the situation that's what I feel this
 
02:05:10.070 --> 02:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation would say
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead oh I was gonna say
 
02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
all I was going to say is that I think
 
02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
that it's imperative that we say that we
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
need further legislation and that we
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
needed this term not study we need some
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
some serious serious discussion and
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
information to be disseminated about
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
this subject
 
02:05:37.550 --> 02:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask you
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I know I'm I'm lameed up but when is
 
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
the filing period is it
 
02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:45.530 align:start position:0%
the filing period is it
December

02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
December
 
02:05:48.649 --> 02:05:48.659 align:start position:0%
I think it's November um I don't know
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
the exact date November so but but but
 
02:05:56.689 --> 02:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
yeah I am lamed up but I think we need
 
02:05:59.689 --> 02:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
to do everything I'm a dead duck but I
 
02:06:02.089 --> 02:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
think we need to uh
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
recommend that legislation be drafted
 
02:06:08.050 --> 02:06:08.060 align:start position:0%
and this committee if they recommend
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that has always been the
 
02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that some members of the
 
02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would get together and draw
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
up legislation and whether you know I
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
know it's an election year and nobody
 
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna be honest because I can now
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to do this during an
 
02:06:27.649 --> 02:06:27.659 align:start position:0%
election year because everybody's busy
 
02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
but I think that it's very important to
 
02:06:32.870 --> 02:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
get OLS and get some ideas down OLS and
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
get it done and it's usually the members
 
02:06:37.550 --> 02:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee where legislation has
 
02:06:44.089 --> 02:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
 
02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
um I didn't really understand what
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
prevents a talent from setting the
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
setbacks for the towers I assume that
 
02:06:54.850 --> 02:06:54.860 align:start position:0%
most towns can put into their zoning
 
02:06:58.129 --> 02:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
setbacks for these towers and then for
 
02:07:00.169 --> 02:07:00.179 align:start position:0%
schools I mean I understand most schools
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
can Institute the program that was
 
02:07:04.729 --> 02:07:04.739 align:start position:0%
described earlier with having no Wi-Fi
 
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
or having a timer that turns off the
 
02:07:09.709 --> 02:07:09.719 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi certain periods of time
 
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and then for the education having the
 
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
the state create education materials
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if the state has the
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
resources to do that and there's already
 
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of information I think if a school
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
district was interested in these things
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
they can reach out to all these
 
02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
different organizations and learn more
 
02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
and make their own decision on how they
 
02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
want to do things
 
02:07:32.649 --> 02:07:32.659 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
again those are all valid points to
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
discuss if we were discussing an actual
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill I think the purpose of this
 
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is to just decide whether
 
02:07:47.330 --> 02:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
we want to say we we recommend further
 
02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
legislative action maybe along these
 
02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
general terms
 
02:07:53.570 --> 02:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
whether a bill comes out of it or not is
 
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
the material as far as what the purpose
 
02:07:59.149 --> 02:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
of this committee is for I I've heard
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
from everybody here so far on on a
 
02:08:05.689 --> 02:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
committee uh
 
02:08:08.209 --> 02:08:08.219 align:start position:0%
represent Parson you want a final word
 
02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
oh I maybe not final thank you so much
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
02:08:16.729 --> 02:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
I've used pretty much everything's up
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
and said here right upon Al
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if towns can be actually
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
initiate a setback but I agree with you
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a conversations best
 
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
held if you're going to be Drafting and
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
I think we need to say yes for the
 
02:08:31.129 --> 02:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
legislation especially in terms of
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
empowering our municipalities so they
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
can make these setbacks they're most
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
deeply affected and they have the fewest
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
tools to really uh for self-education
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
for a fair and personal information
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
and they have less access to FCC than
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
telling the communications industry my
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
concern is very much lies with the
 
02:08:50.810 --> 02:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
process of how we arrived at this point
 
02:08:52.070 --> 02:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
and the voice of our communities really
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
need to be heard in this and I also
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
think we have a comprehensive study
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's already been done and I think we
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
have rather than waiting for somebody
 
02:09:04.729 --> 02:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
else to come forward with a bill we have
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
the momentum uh we have invested the
 
02:09:08.570 --> 02:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
time and I just think we would amplify
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
our efforts by going ahead now to draft
 
02:09:10.679 --> 02:09:12.890 align:start position:0%
our efforts by going ahead now to draft
legislation

02:09:12.890 --> 02:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:14.149 align:start position:0%
legislation
foreign

02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:18.890 --> 02:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chairman
 
02:09:21.709 --> 02:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like would the subcommittee
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps give some idea of whether they
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
would support a dual standard similar to
 
02:09:30.169 --> 02:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
1644 but with a de minimis uh level for
 
02:09:36.050 --> 02:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
um that sounds very specific I'm looking
 
02:09:41.570 --> 02:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
for something general okay but look let
 
02:09:44.089 --> 02:09:44.099 align:start position:0%
me tell you what what my thoughts are my
 
02:09:47.570 --> 02:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
thoughts are that we recommend to our to
 
02:09:49.570 --> 02:09:49.580 align:start position:0%
our full committee next week
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
that that we have that there should be
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
further legislation and it should and it
 
02:09:55.679 --> 02:09:56.810 align:start position:0%
further legislation and it should and it
should

02:09:56.810 --> 02:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:10:01.450 --> 02:10:01.460 align:start position:0%
cover areas such as education Technical
 
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
and I I would I would also argue that it
 
02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
should cover areas of of municipality
 
02:10:10.729 --> 02:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
something that might get the committee
 
02:10:12.890 --> 02:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
on municipality involved because this
 
02:10:15.850 --> 02:10:15.860 align:start position:0%
this might involve it could involve
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
a bill could involve an RSA that affects
 
02:10:21.530 --> 02:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
what type of zoning laws communities
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
could or or can't do I don't know uh the
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
museum the municipality people might
 
02:10:29.390 --> 02:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
know but my recommendation would be that
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
we make it in those general terms that
 
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
whatever goes forward we recommend that
 
02:10:35.589 --> 02:10:35.599 align:start position:0%
it should cover education technical
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
municipality concerns where rsas
 
02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
involving zonings whatever does that
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
kind of answer your question or a
 
02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:47.149 align:start position:0%
kind of answer your question or a
concern

02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.159 --> 02:10:51.470 align:start position:0%
 
um yes

02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
okay with that being said I would like
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
to call for
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
um emotion from the The Sound Community
 
02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
that we that we recommend further
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
legislative action be done covering the
 
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
subjects of RF radiation uh involving
 
02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:10.129 align:start position:0%
subjects of RF radiation uh involving
education

02:11:10.129 --> 02:11:10.139 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
um acknowledging the issues
 
02:11:17.470 --> 02:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
um involving uh more technical aspects
 
02:11:20.089 --> 02:11:20.099 align:start position:0%
that could involve it could involve
 
02:11:24.649 --> 02:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
frequency as well as the power and that
 
02:11:29.209 --> 02:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
we suggest that a priority be placed on
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
any legislation that that might be
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
considered along these lines and that
 
02:11:37.629 --> 02:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
also uh the municip the committee on
 
02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal and whatever the other words
 
02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:41.629 align:start position:0%
Municipal and whatever the other words
are

02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:11:41.639 --> 02:11:42.169 align:start position:0%
are
um

02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
County government Municipal and County
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
government B be involved in in such
 
02:11:49.250 --> 02:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
further legislation as well
 
02:11:54.189 --> 02:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
all those oh uh no you can't vote on
 
02:11:59.330 --> 02:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
that yet
 
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
do I ever second okay all those in favor
 
02:12:06.410 --> 02:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
say goodbye for saying aye aye opposed
 
02:12:08.209 --> 02:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
I'm going to oppose because I believe
 
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be other bills
 
02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:11.629 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be other bills
anyway

02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
so noted committee improves uh five to
 
02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
one who recommended to the full
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee for next week which I'm sure
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much I'll declare this
