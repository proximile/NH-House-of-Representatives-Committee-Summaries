meeting of both committees because you
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
the committee are here before we get
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
started i think we have an announcement
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
for someone to make come on up
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
evening everybody and i hope everybody
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
had a good uh trip up i know we're kind
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
of out of the way up here in my hometown
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
of hayward but we like it here and we're
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
glad that you're here um just a couple
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
housekeeping issues i've been in touch
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
with maintenance about getting the
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
ventilation system going because it
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
automatically shuts down at 5 pm so
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully it'll be making you more
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable very shortly with respect to
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
ingress and egress of this building that
 
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.910 align:start position:0%
ingress and egress of this building that
was

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
opened in february 1972 i know it's kind
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
of amazing here but the way that you
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
came in is the fastest way in the event
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
of a fire or something like that i know
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
that sounds kind of far-fetched but we i
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
just need to make sure that you are
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
aware of where the ingresses and
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
egresses of this building are in the
 
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
egresses of this building are in the
event

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know any other kind of emergency or
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
flames or something like that going
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
through this back door is going to lead
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
you down to another just push that go
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
forward clerk carlson our superior court
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
clerk has asked that nobody go into the
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
back hallway where the judge's offices
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
are etc but if you didn't need to do
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
that in the event of emergency that's
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
fine i will be out of the magnetometer
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
where everybody came in um if you folks
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
need me for anything um enjoy you stay
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
with us and any questions anybody has
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
about the safety of the building or
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
anything like that before i can get out
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
of your way here and let the important
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
stuff begin thank you thank you very
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
much deputy just so everybody knows
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
there was a little snag in communication
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
so the clerk and the sheriff's
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
department didn't know we were coming
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
so they did a last-minute adjustment to
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
their evening and i want to thank you
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
very much the sheriff that called it
 
00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:17.910 align:start position:0%
very much the sheriff that called it
home

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%

grafton county
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
about redistricting

district maps
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
for consideration by the general court
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
i would like an opportunity
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
as with many other voters here in
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
grafton county and around the state to
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
offer comments
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
on those maps before state legislators
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
take any votes on them it's one thing to
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
talk about redistricting in the abstract
 
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
as we're doing
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
here tonight but it's quite another to
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
be able to offer comments and
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
perspectives on specific maps
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
that you have drawn
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
all voters need to have an opportunity
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
to comment on those maps in addition to
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
the opportunity you're providing here
 
00:25:30.159 --> 00:25:31.590 align:start position:0%
the opportunity you're providing here
tonight

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
i also want to urge
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
speaker packard and the members of these
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
special committees to open up these
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
listening sessions
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
in all your public sessions to a remote
 
00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.789 align:start position:0%
in all your public sessions to a remote
auction

00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
auction
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
for those who cannot attend in person
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
the coveted pandemic is far from over
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
and many voters are justifiably
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
reluctant to attend a public indoor
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
gathering like this one
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
we need virtual sessions in which voters
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
can participate online
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
additional access and transparency can
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
only increase the legitimacy
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
of a process
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
that many voters already find murky and
 
00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:11.430 align:start position:0%
that many voters already find murky and
confusing

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
the districts you are drawing are not
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
your districts
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
they're our districts
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
and you do yourselves in the entire
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
process of the service if you do not
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
take every available opportunity
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
including through remote participation
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
to hear from the voters whose right to
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
fair representation is the key to your
 
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.870 align:start position:0%
fair representation is the key to your
work

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
the 2011 redistricting process created
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
some obvious partisan districts
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
that have not served the voters of
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
grafton county very well
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
there are many examples i could point to
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
but for tonight i'll limit my discussion
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
to just three examples
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
the first example is the congressional
 
00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:57.269 align:start position:0%
the first example is the congressional
districts

00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
the 2011-11 redistricting map
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
made an overtly political change
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
the map
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
drawers wanted to help the re-election
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
chances of the then incumbent
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh member in cd2
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
and so they decided to swap
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
one cd2 town campton
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
we all know how that turned out
 
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
we all know how that turned out
politically

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
politically
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
but in any event hampton is now the only
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
grafton county town in cd1
 
00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
and center harbor is the only belknap
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
comedy town in cd2
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know better than i what you have in
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
mind for the congressional districts but
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you at the very least
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
to return camden and center harbor to
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
congressional districts that reflect
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
their geographic social and economic
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
my second example is the state senate
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
districts the 2011 map left grafton
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
county spread across four
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
senate districts
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
the northern towns are in sd1
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
the towns around the plymouth area are
 
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:07.250 align:start position:0%
in sd2
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.789 align:start position:0%
in sd2
[Music]

00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
the towns around hanover and lebanon are
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
in sd5
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
and then there's waterville valley
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
which is the only grafton county
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
community in sd3
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
i won't speculate about whether
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
incumbency protection or other political
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
factors drove that decision
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
but i would simply encourage you to find
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
a way to return waterville valley
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
to a state senate district with other
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:37.919 align:start position:0%
my third example is the floaterial
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
districts i certainly understand the
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
history of ontario districts
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
and i recognize the flexibility they add
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
to your options as map makers trying to
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
allocate 400 state representatives
 
00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:51.029 align:start position:0%
allocate 400 state representatives
across

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
all of new hampshire's communities of
 
00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:53.990 align:start position:0%
all of new hampshire's communities of
interest

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
but i for one am not a fan of ontario
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
districts at least as they affect me and
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
my neighbors here in grafton town
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
yes they make sense in areas of high
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
population down south because they allow
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
you to keep
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative districts relatively
 
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.750 align:start position:0%
representative districts relatively
small

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
but up here in grafton county the
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
floaterial districts have the opposite
 
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:14.710 align:start position:0%
floaterial districts have the opposite
effect

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
the floaterial districts are large and
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
spread out
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
one example is wrapped in district 17
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
which covers six towns
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
in an hour long drive from ashland on
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
the shore of little swan lake
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
to enfield on the shore of mestoma lake
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
the incumbent state representative does
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
a terrific job
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
and is the hardest working elected
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
official i know
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
but grafton 17 is just too big
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
and spread out to reflect new
 
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.909 align:start position:0%
and spread out to reflect new
hampshire's

00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
model of a state representative district
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
that is small and close to the voters
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
i would urge you when you're laying out
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
for ontario districts which i assume you
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
will do to find a way to keep them as
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
finally i just want to note for the
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
record that the 2020 census
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
shows that new hampshire's population of
 
00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:18.470 align:start position:0%
shows that new hampshire's population of
color

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
the proportion is even higher among
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
younger granite staters
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
you have a constitutional duty not to
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
ignore the demographic shifts
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
in our state but to do your best to
 
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
in our state but to do your best to
create

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
districts that will allow voters to
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
elect a truly representative group
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
of public officials the demographic
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
ships in new hampshire as well as in the
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
united states generally are expected to
 
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
united states generally are expected to
continue

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
and accelerate
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
over the next 10 years
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
as voters we are watching your work
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
carefully to see
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
how well you acknowledge and respect
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's changing population
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your time
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%

after your proposed learn preliminary
 
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:02.389 align:start position:0%
after your proposed learn preliminary
maps

00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
maps
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
for public review and comment thank you
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
thank you then chair of the members of
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
the committee it's my honor to be with
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
you this evening um i'm susan duncan i'm
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
from bristol new hampshire which is when
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
i wanted to share some of my
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
observations of having had the honor of
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
working 22 years in the new hampshire
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
state senate as a non-partisan employee
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
i came to this job having helped ned
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
with his senate district campaign
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
at that time um and i when i was hired
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
someone quit one day
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
and carol fletcher came to me and said
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
susan do you want a doctor's hey
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
and so i took it and stayed 22 years and
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
loved it and i was very blessed to be
 
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.789 align:start position:0%
loved it and i was very blessed to be
here

00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
but you have a lot of observations when
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
you sit there and you listen to
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee hearings and you watch people
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
work one of the things that i will note
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
is the thing that i have seen over and
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
over in my experience
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
not a one of you is north vega
 
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
your world's revolve around the
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
populated area of the state whereas i
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
our worlds are very small
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
i used to say to senator pig natalie i
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
said senator you can go to the mall
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
and see more constituents than that can
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
drive across half the district and find
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
we have to go 15 places
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
and it's not equal so one of the things
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
that i would request is as you look at
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
the district thing
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
the areas up here are huge
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
they are big and it takes a long time to
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
get from point a to point b
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
and do the job that many of you are
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
blessed enough to do in a visit at the
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
mall or going to the pizza place and
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
seeing 35 constituents
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's one point that
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
that i really would ask you to think
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
about that that we're not created equal
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
medium colleagues the twitty the dnc the
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
do-nothing zone because you had to fight
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
like the dickens to get anything to
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
happen exit of north events of 20.
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
and why because if the if the refs
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
and the senators from nashua and
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
manchester stood together
 
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
the whole rest of the senate could vote
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't pass something
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:45.830 align:start position:0%
it's not
equal

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
equal
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
and those of us in the north country
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
would like to be equal
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
you look at district one i don't know
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
how in god's green earth anybody runs a
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
campaign in senate district one
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
i thought ned's 32 towns
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
and it takes a lot of work and we should
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank these people that for the same
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars they're willing to do
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
the same job but it is a huge
 
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.270 align:start position:0%
the same job but it is a huge
disadvantage

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
but thank god we have good people who
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
want to work who want to serve and want
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
to come
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the main thing is just please
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
look at the district
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
and think about
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
we are not equal in the north country
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
and we would very much like to be equal
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
we'd love to be part of the committee
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
that makes these decisions and weighs in
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
um a one advanced town you can't get to
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
from one one of those towns to the other
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
without leaving the county
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
you don't know these things unless you
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
live up north
 
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.950 align:start position:0%
live up north
so

00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's my major pitch tonight and i
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening and
 
00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
next

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
madam chair and members of the committee
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
for the record
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
my name is gail kinney and i am a
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
resident of canaan um
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
i'm also a pastor with the united church
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
of christ denomination and so
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
i see this matter of redistricting
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
not just from the lens of a long time
 
00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:40.630 align:start position:0%
not just from the lens of a long time
resident

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
resident
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
of a town that has been denied of its
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required representation
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
but i also see this matter through a
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
basic moral lens
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
and so starting with the moral lens um i
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
would implore this committee
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
to be transparent in what you do
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
because the reality is that democracy
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
dies in darkness
 
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.990 align:start position:0%
dies in darkness
um

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
also to give voters a fair notice for
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
your meetings so people can plan and can
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
try to get here physically
 
00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:17.270 align:start position:0%
try to get here physically
um

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
as much as as possible and also um
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
i really implore you again as a matter
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
of basic morality to
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
really make this process as transparent
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
and as as fair as possible which means
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
giving people a say once there are maps
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
that you have put forth
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
um so that there's an opportunity to
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
react to something specific again just
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
as uh as opposed to providing you with
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
general information before you've made
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
your decisions um and finally as a
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
matter of basic morality
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
access to these sessions is really
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
important and i know that this committee
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
has not made the decision directly
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
to not allow remote access
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
but both for
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
reasons of transportation and reasons of
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
basic health and safety again i would
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
employ you to do what you possibly can
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
to ensure that as you move forward both
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
in this current process and that after
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
maps are developed that
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
there is an opportunity for access
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
beyond just people having to be here in
 
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.829 align:start position:0%
beyond just people having to be here in
person

00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
so now the specifics of being a resident
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
of canaan so i know the kanan select
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
board has has written to you
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
and uh so i urge you all to uh to take
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
that letter and to to consider it really
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
carefully um i would say that i think
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
that the select board was very polite
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
in in its own communication but
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
i want to go back i think that their
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
basic point was that
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
legally constitutionally our town my
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
town is required to have a dis uh its
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
own representative district which we
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
have been robbed of for the past uh
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
decades so
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
i know that that someone else is going
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
to speak with specifics about kanan so i
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
won't get into all of the details but i
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
want to go back specifically to the
 
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.829 align:start position:0%
want to go back specifically to the
constitution

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
so back in 2011 when the last
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
redistricting process was done i watched
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
it very closely as closely as i could
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
however because it was done very quickly
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
and behind closed doors
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
and even though
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
even though in 2011
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
there was a constitutional requirement
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
in this state that towns such as mine
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
have its own district
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
regret to say and i think that some of
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
you are already aware of this that in
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
that last redistricting process
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
in essence um
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
what they um
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
what the operative stance was is the
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
constitution be damned
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe this particular
 
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.230 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe this particular
committee

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
um i i certainly hope that you don't
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
have sort of the same
 
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.589 align:start position:0%
have sort of the same
um

00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
the same way of thinking that constant
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire constitution
 
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:07.750 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire constitution
means

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
well you can do it if you want to but
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
you don't really have to
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
so i want to just read again and i know
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
you're all familiar with this but
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
i want to just emphasize
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
so on november 7
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
2006 the citizens of this state voted
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
um to make a change in part two article
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
11 of the new hampshire constitution so
 
00:39:29.119 --> 00:39:29.990 align:start position:0%
11 of the new hampshire constitution so
that

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
on the end and in the constitutional
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
document itself it explains
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
that this amendment was made in 2006 to
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
enable towns with sufficient population
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
to have their own representative
 
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.030 align:start position:0%
to have their own representative
district

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
and so the language of the constitution
 
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.630 align:start position:0%
and so the language of the constitution
reads

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
reads
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
when the population of any town or ward
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
according to the last federal census
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
is within a reasonable deviation from
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
the ideal population for one or more
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative seats
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
the town or ward
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
shall have
 
00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:05.510 align:start position:0%
shall have
shall

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
shall have its own district of one or
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
more representative seats
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
so my question to you as you go forth
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there are at
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
least 60 towns
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire i think a
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
little more than 60 that were robbed in
 
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.710 align:start position:0%
little more than 60 that were robbed in
2000

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
2000
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the opportunity to have their own
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative districts even though the
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
constitution says shall
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
i would ask you if you haven't already
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
as you started the process if you
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
haven't taken the constitutional mandate
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
and layered it
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
on top of the map and said okay
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
where are we not now following the
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
constitution and how do we cure that
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
with the max that we are drawing going
 
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.510 align:start position:0%
with the max that we are drawing going
forward

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
if the constitutional requirement is not
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
a starting point for this committee then
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
i have a question why not
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
and i would ask the committee to explain
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
to the people of new hampshire
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
for whom the constitution
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
is a sacred document
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
why is that not taking place and why
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
isn't this all being cured so again i
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
implore you
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
cure the constitutional deficiency going
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
forward and i thank you for the work
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that redistrict redistricting
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
should be completed in as non-partisan a
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
manner as possible
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's naive for me to hope in
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
this polarized era
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
this can be done
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
but rather than one party putting its
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
thumb on the scale to tilt districts in
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
their favor
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
why can't there be an even-handed
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
attempt of fairness
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
why not allow all our voices to be heard
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
as a black woman i'm especially
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about gerrymandering that
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
diminishes the voices of people of color
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
rather than suppression why not
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
elevation why not uphold the spirit of
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
the voting rights act and promote free
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
and fair access to the polls
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
i also ask that this committee schedule
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
hearings after the maps are drawn
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
so that the public can weigh in on the
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
redistricting work
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
that has been proposed thank you
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you family members and uh thank
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
you for the job that you're doing and i
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
just want to start by saying i
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that the job that
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
you have to do is not a decent job
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure redistricting is very good
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh i just have a couple of comments
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh is dear to me
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
and bristle is dear to me and bristol
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
very much would like to have its own
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
representative as you could if you look
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
at the numbers we have 3 400 somehow
 
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
people there were within a reasonable
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
deviation of the ideal number and
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
bristol would very much like to have its
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
own representative right now we have two
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
representatives in the large district
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
and a floatario representative
 
00:44:21.599 --> 00:44:22.950 align:start position:0%
and a floatario representative
the

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
district when i look at the districts it
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
looks like they were created by a
 
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.150 align:start position:0%
looks like they were created by a
machine

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.190 align:start position:0%
machine
um

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
it looks like somebody
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
had a computer program that just said
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
want these
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
go down from the top of the county and
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
go down the county
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
and lump these towns together so you
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
come out with an ideal number
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it looks like my district
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
is five towns at the bottom of the
 
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.630 align:start position:0%
is five towns at the bottom of the
county

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
who really don't have much of a common
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
interest three of them do because
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
they're in the newfound district the
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
newfound area school district so bristol
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
and alexandria and bridgewater they have
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
a common interest
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
but then there's ash
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's only one road
 
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.270 align:start position:0%
there's only one road
basically

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
to get from bridgewater to
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
ash one road unless you go out into
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
belmont county you look to ireland
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
and then on the other side there's rap
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
there's gravitonography
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that goes to the and ashland goes to
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
the plymouth school district the penny
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
baker school district
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
on the other side is
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
grafton goes to the mascara school
 
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.270 align:start position:0%
grafton goes to the mascara school
district

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
when i get called to go to school
 
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.150 align:start position:0%
when i get called to go to school
meetings

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
there's you have to drive 40 miles from
 
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.230 align:start position:0%
there's you have to drive 40 miles from
one

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
high school to the other you might just
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
this is this is a house district
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make any sense
 
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.109 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make any sense
it

00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
and it looks to me and i and i look
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
through the districts and
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
and virtually it seems like almost every
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
district in in the county is like that
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
i just don't get it it seems to me that
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
if i were to start doing this
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
redistricting rather than plugging
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
numbers into a computer what i would do
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
is start looking at the school districts
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
because those are the commonalities of
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
i look at the newfound school district
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
and say hey there's
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
there's there's uh five towns in grafton
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
county that go there you know there's
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
the pemmie baker that's it
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
the tummy baker that's the mascoma all
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
of these school districts together would
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
make a whole lot more sense because you
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
have the commonalities of interest
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
ashland being
 
00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.430 align:start position:0%
ashland being
on

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
one side of the merrimack river and
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
grafton focusing in on the connecticut
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
river communities have absolutely
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with each other
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
they certainly in terms of paying taxes
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
all have the same interest but
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh and they have very different
 
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.349 align:start position:0%
uh and they have very different
interests

00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
and so my suggestion is that you look at
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
particularly at the school districts and
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
trying to put the school districts
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
together and have some commonality of
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
interest and put a human touch in the
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
way you design the district
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
the only other comment this is sort of
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
on the senate side having
 
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
on the senate side having
served

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
served
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
i served four terms as a senator here in
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
largely grafton county
 
00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
largely grafton county
but

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh if you and i think the point was well
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
taken about waterloo about
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
being outside the county makes for
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it just
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it was just
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
a number but it should be in grafton
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
county and it should be within the
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
grafton county senate district as best
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
as it can be which it used to be and i
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
district one is probably going to have
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
to move down because they have reduced
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
population and further into graph and
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
county as it did in the last
 
00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:48.230 align:start position:0%
county as it did in the last
redistricting

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
but the one thing i'd say is for senate
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
district 2 which is the senate district
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
that serves this particular area
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
it would be best if you didn't right now
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's three counties
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
it would be best if when you're redoing
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
those senate districts that you
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
with senate district two you just did
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
two counties and not
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
to go into three separate counties
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
as a senator it makes more sense to have
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
to do with two county governments than
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
it does three or four
 
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.109 align:start position:0%
it does three or four
so

00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
those are those are
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
generally my
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
my suggestions
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
again i know it's a difficult job
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
re echo what everybody else has said is
 
00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:37.270 align:start position:0%
re echo what everybody else has said is
that's

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
just be fair and do as much as you can
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
to put a human touch on it
 
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.710 align:start position:0%
to put a human touch on it
so

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
this evening
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
my name is mike sampson i'm the town
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh i've been
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
in town government and
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
state and local
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
politics for
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
about 55 years
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i go back long enough so i remember
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
when people gathered in communities
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the state government
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
primarily for problem solving
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
it was not partisan
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
i feel comfortable saying that i
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
remember it well
 
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
i had the opportunity to experience it
 
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.990 align:start position:0%
i had the opportunity to experience it
firsthand

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
firsthand
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate it more and more every
 
00:49:46.319 --> 00:49:47.270 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate it more and more every
day

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
that willingness to gather together to
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
make things happen
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
i work in canaan my border selectmen i
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
sent you a letter i'm the
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
senator of my board chairman
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of politics my entire two of my
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
board members are republicans one's a
 
00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.910 align:start position:0%
board members are republicans one's a
democrat

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm a democrat
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
as the politics
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
all of us live in the town of canada
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
and we have a little bit under 3 900
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
residents citizens in kenya
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
so we met we met the criteria back in
 
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:31.510 align:start position:0%
so we met we met the criteria back in
2010

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
2010
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
for a single
 
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.150 align:start position:0%
for a single
district

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
we meet the criteria still
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
we know the constitution says we racist
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact i raised this issue
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
for the last committees that worked to
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
design districts back in 2011.
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
i've been around kenya for a few years
 
00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:52.470 align:start position:0%
i've been around kenya for a few years
and

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
that time we also asked that would be
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
considered that we have at least one
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
so today i'm here before you
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
we have two representatives
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
in 11 and
 
00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:12.230 align:start position:0%
in 11 and
16.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
16.
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
and uh i think it's 16. hopefully i got
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
there right
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
and i suspect some of you may have
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
driven up through wentworth
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
seen it some of you probably did not
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
drive up through canada but it's out
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
there somewhere
 
00:51:33.599 --> 00:51:34.870 align:start position:0%
there somewhere
and

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
the key thing about it is if i think of
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
my own town where i have to solve a
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of problems every single
 
00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.390 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of problems every single
year

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
year

doesn't want zoning it also doesn't want
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
the problems
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
when there is no zone
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%

huge number of diverse
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%

i know you all have private water and

sewer projects you're familiar with them
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
you know what the funding systems are
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
i've got zero so i just wanted forty
 
00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:12.549 align:start position:0%
i've got zero so i just wanted forty
percent

00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
of my water and sewer rates
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost of necessary repairs
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
those are issues in cadence
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect to our
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
representatives in wentworth
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
and i will say that i have gotten
 
00:53:27.359 --> 00:53:28.630 align:start position:0%
and i will say that i have gotten
cooperation

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
both from the senate and from the house
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
on issues that have come up before us
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
but in terms of having the day-to-day
 
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.549 align:start position:0%
but in terms of having the day-to-day
voice

00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
voice
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
in the legislature so there could be
 
00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
in the legislature so there could be
conversation

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.829 align:start position:0%
conversation
dialogue

00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
dialogue
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm beseeching you
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think that there's some other language
 
00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
that may have been a little more harsh
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the letter
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
but as a person that has to deal with
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
those issues
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
i'm beseeching you
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
to honor the constitutional requirement
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
and give us a voice
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
give us a voice please give us a voice
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
so we can be part of the dialogue
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
that'll solve problems
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
so all i'm asking for is a voice
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of representatives
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
i think somebody mentioned that there's
 
00:54:17.359 --> 00:54:18.470 align:start position:0%
i think somebody mentioned that there's
60

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
60
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
60 little communities to fit this
 
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.309 align:start position:0%
60 little communities to fit this
criteria

00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
please consider
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
honoring the constitution of this state
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
and give us when it says shall that's
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
what it's supposed to be it's supposed
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
please give us a seat if you still want
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
to have us part of an eighth
 
00:54:41.119 --> 00:54:42.390 align:start position:0%
to have us part of an eighth
town

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislative district okay
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
at least we got one voice
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
that we would have
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
that could represent the people that
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
can't afford their water and sewer bills
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
can't afford the education tax
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
that have other problems that are
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
inherent in being in the community our
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
size with the diversity we have
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
because the alternative here
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
is not you know we really want to
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
support problem solving
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
not partisan politics
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
not partisanship
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
so what do we have to do to guarantee a
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
voice when we go to elections next year
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to vote for anybody
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
name the party
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
as long as they're from canaan now at
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
least give us a candid voice
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
so let's try to be a little bit more
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable where we can actually pick
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
the most qualified candidate in canaan
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
to represent us
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
in the legislature for problems up
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
give us a voice please
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
the constitution says
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
i know your job is difficult i did it in
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
another state in vermont i know how
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
difficult it is in every state and i
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
know that people have looked for
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
solutions forever
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
the one advantage you have
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's better than having 150 seats or 120
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
seats in terms of being able to
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
represent communities
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
so that's it it's that's the end of the
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
appeal we do i think all of you got a
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
copy of our letter
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
now we mean it it isn't just some
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
letter that somebody somebody did ask
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's all right we had it come from the
 
00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:30.470 align:start position:0%
it's all right we had it come from the
community

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
but at least two of the board members
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
were on the board
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
in 2011 when this issue came up
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
both of them strong republicans and both
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
of them agreed at that point so what
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
listen to us please and if you can do
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
anything to address this it would be
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
helpful it would be it'd be terrible to
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
campaign based purely on we need to have
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
a voice from camden's elected king
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have thank you very much
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%

there's a nice balance of representation
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:45.190 align:start position:0%
there's a nice balance of representation
[Music]

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.870 align:start position:0%

living in the north country especially
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
we know the importance of networking and
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
collaborating to get things done
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
so that is what north country reps do
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
they work together
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
to address north country issues
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
for our constituents
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
and to me
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
that is one of our greatest strengths
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%

lebanon
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
just a voter i'm not as eloquent as some
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
of these other folks that have spoken
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
already but
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that uh
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
i think we voters are kind of really
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
tired of the partisanship
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
and gerrymandering
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
we want fairly drawn districts that are
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
neutral not favoring one side or the
 
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.670 align:start position:0%
neutral not favoring one side or the
other

00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.789 align:start position:0%
other
and

00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
logically drawn as well
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
i mean and we want transparency we want
 
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
to know if you're using software we want
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
to know what the algorithm is that
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
decided what these districts are going
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
i hope we could avoid that route if
 
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.109 align:start position:0%
i hope we could avoid that route if
possible

00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
as we've heard from others i think a
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
little more
 
00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
thinking needs to go into it than just
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
allowing software to
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
draw the districts
 
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.829 align:start position:0%
draw the districts
um

00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
and also i think you know we need to
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
hear the voices of the people who can't
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
physically come to these meetings
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
the people who are sick or disabled or
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
too elderly to come
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
their voice counts too they still vote
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
and they have a right to be heard both
 
00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.309 align:start position:0%
and they have a right to be heard both
before

00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
and after
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
the maps have been drawn
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
so please consider that and our
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
democracy is hanging by a thread right
 
01:00:05.359 --> 01:00:06.230 align:start position:0%
democracy is hanging by a thread right
now

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you folks will be the
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
people that bring it back from the brink
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
rather than the ones that help push it
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
over the edge
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for those comments
 
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:47.250 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
some of you
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
came from a really long distance to be
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
i come from canada
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
i served in the new hampshire house for
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
four terms
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
and so i'm a little bit
 
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.789 align:start position:0%
and so i'm a little bit
uh

01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
acquainted with the redistricting
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
process i was there during the 2011
 
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.109 align:start position:0%
process i was there during the 2011
redistricting

01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
i'm also
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat acquainted with the
 
01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.390 align:start position:0%
somewhat acquainted with the
constitution

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
and besides the part of the constitution
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
that says
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
a town like kenya should have its own
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative the constitution also
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh districts
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
this is in
 
01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
part two article nine says districts
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
shall be elected and founded on
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
principles of equality
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
and representative therein shall be as
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
i've heard committee members say that 90
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
of the redistricting
 
01:02:00.079 --> 01:02:01.349 align:start position:0%
of the redistricting
decisions

01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
are based on population
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
and it's only 10 percent that can deal
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
with other banks
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
i think that we have to change that
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh because
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
people population does i mean equal
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
towns does not mean
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
equal population is not equal quality
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
accounts equality includes as much as
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
possible the same regional planning
 
01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:32.309 align:start position:0%
possible the same regional planning
area

01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
the same school district certainly
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
the same medical and recreational
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
resources the same geographical area
 
01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.750 align:start position:0%
resources the same geographical area
area

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
and this district
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
disregards these principles of equality
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
the select pen would be ignoring our new
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
venture constitution
 
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.990 align:start position:0%
venture constitution
i'll

01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
repeat some of what people have said
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
before about the results of the
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
redistricting in 2011 11 for
 
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.750 align:start position:0%
redistricting in 2011 11 for
kane

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.109 align:start position:0%

01:03:03.119 --> 01:03:04.470 align:start position:0%
canaan
district

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.910 align:start position:0%
district
uh

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
sau 62
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
but the district goes into an
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
other school district all of the uh
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
all of the townspeople of the district
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
are not in the same school district
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
canaan is in the upper valley son of the
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
regional planning area
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
the network is now
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
kanan is in the
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
mascoma valley watershed
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
you have to go over to the
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
mountain to the baker river watershed in
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh get to the other end of our districts
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
canaan's churches don't attract people
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
from wentworth and wentworth's church
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't attract people from canaan
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
canyon residents use skin community
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
healthcare and dr hitchcock for medical
 
01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:51.829 align:start position:0%
healthcare and dr hitchcock for medical
needs

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
wentworth residents don't come over the
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
hill to us they go towards women
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
travelers from canaan to wentworth the
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
northern part of the space station
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
traveled through two towns
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
rotten and rumbly in order to get from
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
katie to wentworth the third town in its
 
01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
katie to wentworth the third town in its
history

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
so when worth does not share schools
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
does not share regional bank does not
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
share labor and commercial areas medical
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
or recreational resources or a
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so i say that the district
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
violates article
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
that article from part two of our
 
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.190 align:start position:0%
that article from part two of our
constitution

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
the mathematical formula which has been
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
used for determining plateau districts
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
theoretically it's each representative
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
equal numbers of voters but practically
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
it clearly doesn't do that
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
the representative elected and drafted
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
district 9 my base district has to win
 
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:55.640 align:start position:0%

area with 10
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.910 align:start position:0%
123 residents this is not giving the two
representatives

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
the same number of voters to represent
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
it is not a fair to the either to the
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
people of those towns or to the
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
representative that
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
represents such a diverse group
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
but there's a way that we can solve the
 
01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.750 align:start position:0%
but there's a way that we can solve the
problem

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
with its population 3794
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
deserves its own district as required in
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
part to article 11.
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%

enfield with a population about 4 400

01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
should continue to have its own district
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
if we create a third district
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
which includes the excess population for
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%

01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
share the same
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
community the same school district and
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
work together very well
 
01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.230 align:start position:0%
work together very well
uh

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
the population of those combined towns
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
if you think of three districts from
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
enfield kenya and overlying district
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
including all five towns it is within
 
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.069 align:start position:0%
including all five towns it is within
3.8

01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
of the target population
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
and so i hope that you will look very
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
carefully and consider that as an
 
01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.670 align:start position:0%
carefully and consider that as an
alternative

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
a taste
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
if i may distribute it which
 
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.630 align:start position:0%
if i may distribute it which
uh

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
tries to describe that so thank you very
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
much for being here and for listening to
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
me i
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
do want you to work hard
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
the next sign up that i see here from
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.599 --> 01:07:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
you i'm catherine moore holland
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
and i was a representative or a plateau
 
01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.309 align:start position:0%
and i was a representative or a plateau
district

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you should
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
consider more
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
specifically than anything is to
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
eliminate any ontario district at all
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
i felt it was very hard to represent my
 
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.349 align:start position:0%
i felt it was very hard to represent my
community

01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
particularly and this has been
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
emphasized already the school districts
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
are absolutely crucial to the unity of
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
the special
 
01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.630 align:start position:0%
the special
district

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.990 align:start position:0%
district
and

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
the only way we can work together is
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
of interest
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
which overrides partisanship and deals
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
with the good of the community and the
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
communities being able to work together
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i think that's true of
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of junction and
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
 
general

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
i've sort of combined a couple of things
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
my husband's already talked about the
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
representation and came in in the past
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to touch on it again
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
this should be that we had um
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
in 2001 and again it was a republican
 
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.510 align:start position:0%
in 2001 and again it was a republican
controlled

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
discernment process gave us a very nice
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
description for the five masculine towns
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
and it was a it was shaped about like
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
this where the five towns were all
 
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.229 align:start position:0%
this where the five towns were all
contiguous

01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
contiguous
 
01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:57.189 align:start position:0%
contiguous
um

01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
and we had representatives from the
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
district and if we did what chuck has
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
suggested and had one rep for for
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
enfield one for kenyan and one with the
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
excess combined with the other the other
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
three smaller towns
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
um would basically be revisiting what we
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
had um in 2001 which worked very well
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
the people in the massacre committee
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
has come to district um we see each
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
other if we go to the school school
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
board meetings um
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
in the school
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
we also see each other and each we go to
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
each other's um
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh home days we go to school we go to
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
the same churches
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
we go to the same shops we go heard the
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
same restaurants we see each other so
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
many in so many ways the representatives
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
um knew people
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and people knew who the
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
representatives were
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
and now we don't we have people who are
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
way off in the town that you can't get
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
there from here without leaving
 
01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:00.870 align:start position:0%
there from here without leaving
um

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
without leaving the area because the
 
01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
alveolar actually goes between them is
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
closed in the winter um
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to say also is that um
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
the representation
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
i i thought at one point or maybe the
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
other statement should have been more
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
fair for the representatives than it is
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
for those being represented
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't work very well either way
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
for instance enfield which is a town of
 
01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
4 400
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
has two representatives one uh
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
on its own and one in this ontario
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
district was grafted into the town of
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
about thirteen hundred thousand third
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
the size of enfield is three
 
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.870 align:start position:0%
the size of enfield is three
representatives

01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
um that's in three words that challenge
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
one through the size of the other
 
01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:45.910 align:start position:0%
one through the size of the other
has

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
one and a half you know has 50 percent
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
more representation
 
01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
more representation
um

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
because of the weight of the districts
 
01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
because of the weight of the districts
were

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
um that also
 
01:11:56.239 --> 01:11:57.189 align:start position:0%
um that also
um

01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
someone who represents
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
enfield has
 
01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.590 align:start position:0%
enfield has
um

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
four thousand four hundred constituents
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
but there's no representations
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that photographer told me that's one
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative was 14 000 constituents
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not fair to anybody
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
coming and going it's not fair to the
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
people who need a presentation it's not
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
fair for people who are trying to
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
represent the people uh who elect them
 
01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
represent the people uh who elect them
so

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
please consider very carefully
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh how you're building communities and
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
and how full the representation is to
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
each person and how reasonable the job
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
is that you're assigned to each of the
 
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.070 align:start position:0%
is that you're assigned to each of the
representatives

01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
david andrews has signed up david did
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
you have some maps did you want to go at
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
good evening dave andrews uh
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to talk a little bit about
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh graphic county in particular uh it's
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
been mentioned before
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
but for the uh congressional districts
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
campaign is kind of an outlier in that
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's in district one it's the only town
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
in grafton county in district one it's
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
town it is uh sau in district one it's
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
the only town in its public health
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
region in district one it's really um
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
should be in district two with the rest
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
of grafton county
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then i wanted to talk a little bit
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
state house districts
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
difficult part
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
of districting
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is the calculation of
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
the floaterials
 
01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
the floaterials
and

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
i know i've done a lot of mapping
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
i spent hours
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with maps for the
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
house districts in grafton county and
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
the absolute best i could do with the
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
current methodology
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
was still having three towns not get
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
their own representatives that should um
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
i was unable to give i believe it was
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
plymouth infield and kanan their own
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative using the current
 
01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.910 align:start position:0%
representative using the current
methodology

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
but with the alternative component
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
method that i
 
01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:28.470 align:start position:0%
method that i
developed

01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
developed
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
it would allow for all of the towns that
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
are eligible for their own districts to
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
have their own districts and thus their
 
01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.270 align:start position:0%
have their own districts and thus their
representatives

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
so i would just ask that you
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
consider the alternative component
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
method again as a methodology for
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
calculating flow tarials
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to answer any and all
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh pertaining to that
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
methodology and um
 
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:54.630 align:start position:0%
methodology and um
yeah

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%

if i seem familiar to
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
systematically

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
systematically
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
mask off
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%

01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to speak briefly tonight on
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
a few points i was struck as i came into
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
this this is my first time speaking
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
before distributing committee
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
at dirk for pro in this process
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
that we are all here tonight you are all
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
here because
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're here for the people we're here for
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
the greatest staters
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
and your job and ultimately
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
our job is to make sure that maps are
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
drawn that provide fair and equal
 
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.870 align:start position:0%
drawn that provide fair and equal
representation

01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
i rise and shine every day remembering
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
that our job is for the grand people
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
that we serve here in the granite state
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
i want to make a few quick points just
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
about the process the before and the
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
after so speaking to
 
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.669 align:start position:0%
after so speaking to
fairness

01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
and to transparency
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
public hearings so we're having those
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
obviously because we're here tonight and
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
i know of others
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
but including and others have spoken
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
in this day and age of a worldwide
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's unprecedented
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
that well number one a worldwide
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic like this is unprecedented in
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
our time but not having access for
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
immunocompromised have other health
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
issues as well as the inability to
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
travel i find that unfortunate and would
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
hope it could be reconsidered i am
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
pleased that there is um
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
there is streaming live streaming taking
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
place i think that that is definitely a
 
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction but i think
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
we need to open that door
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
websites that or a common location where
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
you could go and not only see the dates
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
but find information now when i googled
 
01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
might be the platform that i'm using but
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
when i googled new hampshire
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
redistricting um gerrymandering
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
regis really focused on redistricting in
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
i finally found my way to the general
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
court website where i found
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
i could look for or locate two areas
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
that i could click on to learn about the
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
senate side and the house side but i
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
think elevating the prominence of that
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
and i could be missing something i think
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
is also
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
equally as important for for public
 
01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.950 align:start position:0%
equally as important for for public
access

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
routine public communication again
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
through websites and these sex
 
01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.350 align:start position:0%
through websites and these sex
appearance

01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
appearance
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
and making sure that
 
01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the rationale that
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
is used is made clear and clearly
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
described to the members of the public
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
again speaking in the before and then
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
the after we're here
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
now talking about the process
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
but more importantly and i've heard
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
others speak to this tonight will be the
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity that we should have to
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
respond to the maps once they are drawn
 
01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:43.430 align:start position:0%
respond to the maps once they are drawn
and

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
i like you and i'm sure many of you in
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
this room if not all look forward to
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
that opportunity as well um i'd like to
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
speak to the maps themselves and what i
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
consider what they should look like and
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
just thinking about inclusive that maps
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
should be inclusive with engagement
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities so we're talking about
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
common areas
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
common problems that need common
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
solutions and so how do we do this
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
one we think about the landscape there
 
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:12.709 align:start position:0%
one we think about the landscape there
are

01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
rural and urban areas suburban areas
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
micropolitans throughout this district
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
as well as throughout the state they
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
need to be considered
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
the population numbers and the growing
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
diversity in our population so diverse
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
and a number of special times tonight
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
serving multiple county governments
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
multiple school boards
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
those should be considered as well and
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
social compacts i believe are equally as
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
important i was reflecting as it was
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
gene townsend was talking about the
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
canaan farmers market is one of the most
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
popular places
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
in canaan to be on a sunday morning and
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
neighbors know neighbors elected
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
officials no elected officials
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
and that's how they talk about the
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
common problems
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
and the common solutions that they're
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
going to work on together and i think
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we need to take that take that into
 
01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.430 align:start position:0%
that we need to take that take that into
consideration

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
and preserve that
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i'm going to say is
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to join the voices without um
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to join the voices they're
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
advocating for and
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative for the town of canaan
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the town administrator
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
mike sampson we've heard from gail kitty
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard from chuck townsend and
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard from gene townsend um not
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
just about the constitutional
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility that we have but the
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
importance this decision
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
has been looming for years and it's it's
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
well known and i think the town
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
administrator was one of the speakers
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
who could talk about the common problems
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
of the common solutions that aren't
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
as easily solved with the distance
 
01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:57.910 align:start position:0%
as easily solved with the distance
provided

01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
between how they are represented now and
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers of look at their
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
population numbers and their diversity
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm joining without repeating what's
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
been said um the chorus advocating for
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%

um i do have a few concerns tonight that
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'd like to bring to the committee's
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
attention specifically the article 1
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
section 2 requires the apportionment of
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
state representatives of the states
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
that must be carried out every 10 years
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
which we know is the census which
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
obviously is now complete and why we're
 
01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:09.510 align:start position:0%
obviously is now complete and why we're
here

01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
and you are in the thick of redrawing
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
these maps
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
my concerns are fivefold
 
01:23:16.639 --> 01:23:18.070 align:start position:0%
my concerns are fivefold
one

01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
i do represent hanover and lime as
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned before
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to bring to your attention
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
that hannover warrant article number 27
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
was passed at our town meeting in 2021
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
asking and resolving this process for
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
redistricting should be a fair and
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
effective representation of new
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire voters and that an independent
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission should draw
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
these maps in a way that does not rely
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
on partisan data like election results
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
party registration
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
or favor political parties or candidates
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
just like to reiterate that
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
i am concerned about a fair and
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
transparent process for redistricting
 
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
before and after the maps are drawn
 
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
let's talk about what that would look
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
like before proper notice should be
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
given at least 10 days prior to hearing
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
for the other jurisdictions that you'll
 
01:24:09.510 --> 01:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
be seeing
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
in the next few weeks
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
we need these 10 days because people
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
need time to arrange child care elder
 
01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:15.430 align:start position:0%
need time to arrange child care elder
care

01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
work arrangements etc
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
this time is crucial and i am important
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
to include it in your future meetings
 
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
to include it in your future meetings
access

01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
access
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing hearings should be
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
accessible to those who cannot attend in
 
01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.430 align:start position:0%
accessible to those who cannot attend in
person

01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
given obviously the pandemic that we're
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
all experiencing but also other health
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
concerns and ability concerns child care
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
or elder care that i just spoke about
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
and also work arrangements
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
remote av access
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
like zoom for instance
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
should be made available for these
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
hearings so that all regardless of
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
status or situation can participate by
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
providing testimony by hearing the
 
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
comments in the room and by watching
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
i implore you before these maps are
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
drawn to collect these facts these
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
concerns and this testimony
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
to compile this record in such a way
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
prior to drawing the maps but also to
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
incorporate those exact findings into
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
your map drawing process
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
a fair and transparent
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
process will also include
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
this work after the maps are drawn
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
um first notice is an important issue
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
unlike the last redistricting effort
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like your committee to give
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
more than 24 hours notice when those
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
maps are redrawn for public review and
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
comment and to make those redrawn maps
 
01:25:40.229 --> 01:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
available publicly as soon as possible
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
please don't delay a secretary's process
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
will not benefit anyone
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'd also like you to issue a report
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
responding to the facts and the
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that you've heard
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
across the state and explain how you
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
chose to or not
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
to include that in your redrawing
 
01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
to include that in your redrawing
efforts

01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
a fair and transparent process should
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
also include
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
an important methodology review like
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
many other young professionals to move
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
to our area i represent a key
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
constituency of taxpayers who believe
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
that science facts logic and reason
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
should be driving our state's policy
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
making to solve problems just like this
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
redistricting that means i understand
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
partisanship will definitely play a role
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm imploring you
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
please avoid the dangerous abuses that
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
can be very enticing when re-drawing
 
01:26:30.159 --> 01:26:31.350 align:start position:0%
can be very enticing when re-drawing
lines

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
simply put there should be no packing
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
and no cracking
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
when large cities and towns are packed
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
together and small communities are
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
cracked apart it becomes very obvious
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
that these constituents are being robbed
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
of their real representation
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
a second concern tonight or sorry that's
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
the third concern tonight that i have
 
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
are constitutional considerations
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
like to remind you that daniel webster
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
once said the right to choose a
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
representative is every man's portion of
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
sovereign power
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
i may remember this being cited in
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
burling versus the speaker of house 2002
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
before our supreme court
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
also part 2 article 9
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
11 our new hampshire constitution
 
01:27:14.159 --> 01:27:15.430 align:start position:0%
11 our new hampshire constitution
require

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
for about each
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
four hundred and forty four percent
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
there should result the single seat for
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
either a town or a multi municipal area
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
or floating material district
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
um in a way that
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
it shows each person's vote has equal
 
01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.189 align:start position:0%
it shows each person's vote has equal
weight

01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
weight
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
our state law requires that state
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
legislative districts be contiguous and
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
maintain the boundaries of towns awards
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
or unincorporated places
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
these so-called material districts
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
should be among communities
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
something that's been raised several
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
times tonight
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
specifically i'd like to speak to the
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
executive council maps which should be
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
redrawn to more accurately reflect
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
common communities of interest and
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
reflect partisan balances within the
 
01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:00.149 align:start position:0%
reflect partisan balances within the
state

01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
the second district's partisan
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering is really quite egregious
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
and i implore you to fix it
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
a federal consideration
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
is that congressional districts should
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
and remain competitive districts
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
you can see through population shifts
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
through our census that not much has
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
changed for our congressional districts
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
any shifts that have arrived or that may
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
change in your maps should remain
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
largely the same in terms of the line
 
01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.709 align:start position:0%
largely the same in terms of the line
drive

01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
drive
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
you should reflect common school
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
districts public utilities and fire
 
01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.590 align:start position:0%
districts public utilities and fire
departments

01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to remind you that the new
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court in the burling
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
versus the speaker of the house case in
 
01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.629 align:start position:0%
versus the speaker of the house case in
2002

01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
2002
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
was a place where our granite state
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
justices hired a consultant and
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
determined a more equitable
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
apportionment under the court's plan as
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's identified in the case
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
i encourage this commission to use a
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
similar methodology to avoid
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
additional litigation as the outcome of
 
01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
just redistributing the process
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
furthermore let the united states
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
encourage um
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
be your guiding light excuse me
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
i encourage this commission to rely
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
heavily on reynolds versus sims from
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
1965 and established
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
in that case the principle for one
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
person one vote
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
for an aqua population requirement
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
beware as well that the equal protection
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
clause can provide grounds for any
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
future racial gerrymandering claims
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
originating in our metropolitan areas or
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
my fourth concern is about potential
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
litigation being a lawyer something i
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
know about something about it
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
first the cost of litigation
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
the center for public integrity in 2012
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
released grading reports for
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
transparency across the united states
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
and in 2010 new hampshire scored very
 
01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:56.629 align:start position:0%
and in 2010 new hampshire scored very
low

01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
low
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
was burdened here in our state because
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
it was hidden largely from the public
 
01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:02.790 align:start position:0%
it was hidden largely from the public
view

01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
view
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
when the master released at the very
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
last minute it didn't help the process
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
expensive litigation no doubt fouled uh
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
because of that untransparent
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
unauthentic process
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
and who flipped the bill our taxpayers
 
01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
in december 2020 the national conference
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
of state legislatures published a work
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
entitled more redistricting transparency
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
thus litigation by rebecca greene
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
one of the conclusions is that when
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's an increased authentic
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
transparent process for redistricting
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
there's a statistically significant drop
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
in litigation rates
 
01:30:41.679 --> 01:30:42.709 align:start position:0%
in litigation rates
now

01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
another conclusion was that the courts
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
tend to draw adverse inferences against
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
secretive redistricting processes
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
we can do better here in the future
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
let's aim for an a grade
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
let's have authentic transparency
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
throughout our process and avoid
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
expensive and expensive litigation for
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
my last concern is the consequences of
 
01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.470 align:start position:0%
my last concern is the consequences of
gerrymandering

01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
it hurts us because districts do not
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
reflect the accurate balance of
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
partisanship which further divides our
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
political parties one party
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
is given a majority in the state house
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
despite only having a minority of the
 
01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
despite only having a minority of the
votes

01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
and it's at the expense of the minority
 
01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.750 align:start position:0%
and it's at the expense of the minority
party

01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
politicians are picking their voters
 
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.270 align:start position:0%
politicians are picking their voters
voters

01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
don't pick their elected officials in
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
this case
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
as miss massimilia has said earlier
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
tonight just regular voters want mutual
 
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
tonight just regular voters want mutual
districts

01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
heed their call
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the brennan center reported the
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
majority of americans oppose partisan
 
01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:45.590 align:start position:0%
majority of americans oppose partisan
gerrymandering

01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
and in 2019 the alg research opinion
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
polls showed that 70 of voters from all
 
01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.470 align:start position:0%
polls showed that 70 of voters from all
parties

01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
parties
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
agree that skoda should place some
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
limits on gerrymandering
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
and 55 of all voters with partisan
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
affiliation have unfavorable views of
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
the practice
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
ask yourself
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
what does this mean politically over
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
time if you continue to draw these
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
partisan maps
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
what does it mean for your party what
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
another consequence of gerrymandering is
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
that our districts will not represent
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
the people itself
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
it will limit our voting rights will
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
hurt our children
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
and hurt people of color
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
it divides communities from their
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
natural commonalities and traffic flow
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
their geographic and natural landmarks
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
a political question for you
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
at a time when public confidence in
 
01:32:40.709 --> 01:32:40.719 align:start position:0%
government is at an all-time low if you
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
create a pre-ordained outcome under new
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire gop leadership to deprive the
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
voters of any meaningful influence
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the next election ask yourself are
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
you prepared to own the decision
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
to rob those americans of their most
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental way to participate in our
 
01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:01.669 align:start position:0%
fundamental way to participate in our
democracy

01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
ronald reagan said
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's all we're asking for to end the
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
undemocratic and un-american practice of
 
01:33:17.199 --> 01:33:19.030 align:start position:0%
undemocratic and un-american practice of
gerrymandering

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
the fact is gerrymandering has become a
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
national scandal
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
do not let new hampshire become the next
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
north carolina
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
the next ohio the next pennsylvania
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
national embarrassment
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
for this kind of redistricting extremely
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
partisan on top of the recent polarized
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
climate and concord
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to give you notice that a
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
religious generation gerrymandering
 
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.189 align:start position:0%
religious generation gerrymandering
mapped

01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
mapped
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
math excuse me is going to add one more
 
01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
math excuse me is going to add one more
tip

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
tip
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
marked the reasons why new hampshire
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
could be stripped of its first
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
elimination primary and for you
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
as an attorney and foreign constitution
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
i deeply believe
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
more than that i have a professional
 
01:34:08.470 --> 01:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
duty and a moral obligation to support
 
01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.149 align:start position:0%
duty and a moral obligation to support
laws

01:34:10.149 --> 01:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
laws
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
that are equitable inclusive
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
and just for all granite staters
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
i'm honored to serve the communities and

and my conscience requires my advocacy
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
for a fair and independent registration
 
01:34:25.199 --> 01:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
for a fair and independent registration
process

01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
i encourage you to please take these
 
01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
i encourage you to please take these
concerns

01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
into consideration in your endeavors
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming in your
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
testimony i apologize i think that i
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
skipped over is there an inward purpose
 
01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:46.229 align:start position:0%
skipped over is there an inward purpose
here

01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
i'm ingrid curtis from hanover
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank the committee for
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
their work
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
and also say
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have a tremendous opportunity right
 
01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.030 align:start position:0%
you have a tremendous opportunity right
now

01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
in this redistricting to improve
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
the partisan
 
01:35:18.629 --> 01:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
politics that we've gotten into
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
we have many many things that we care
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
about in common especially if
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
we are redistricted
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
better in a better way for the natural
 
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
communities to be united in their
 
01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:36.229 align:start position:0%
communities to be united in their
representation

01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
we're all unhappy
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
with what's happened with the increasing
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
partisanship in this country
 
01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.550 align:start position:0%
partisanship in this country
and

01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
this is a way
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
if you can be
 
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.590 align:start position:0%
if you can be
transparent

01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
people can know why the decisions were
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
made and have input on why the decisions
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
were made
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
and common sense is used
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
that we can
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
make a start towards making things
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
better and not do another step
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
of having
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
partisan redistricting
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
that harms us all and i assume that you
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
all care about new hampshire and the
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
interest in new hampshire
 
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.310 align:start position:0%
interest in new hampshire
um

01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
we all know that that's the best way to
 
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.109 align:start position:0%
we all know that that's the best way to
go

01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
that in the long term
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
making decisions based on anything but
 
01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:32.550 align:start position:0%
making decisions based on anything but
fairness

01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
and equality are really harmful to the
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
country so i implore you to use your
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to improve things in this
 
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:42.870 align:start position:0%
opportunity to improve things in this
state

state

and not go down the road we've been
going
