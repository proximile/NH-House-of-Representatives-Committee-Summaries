all right good morning everybody's being

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 1643 FM
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the prime sponsor of

towns of Hudson and health
 
00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
this bill will amend RSA 263.35 the
 
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
section that requires new residents to
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
transfer their out-of-state driver's
 
00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:05.099 align:start position:0%
license to an in-state driver's license
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
to add an additional report to add
 
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
additional reporting requirements every
 
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
personal circumstances change within
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
those 60 days and minor penalties for
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
failing to do so
 
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
this bill is a follow-up to the letter
 
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
sent to end speaker Jasper on September
 
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
6 2017 by the Secretary of State and
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner safety which I have
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee
 
00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
in this letter it was identified that
 
00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:30.309 align:start position:0%
in this letter it was identified that
while

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
6540 individuals presented an
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
out-of-state driver's license while
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
using same-day registration to vote in
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
the 2016 general election roughly 10
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
months later
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
when the records were examined to
 
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
respond to speaker desperate's inquiry
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
which was well beyond the 60-day
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
requirement of RSA 26335
 
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
only 15.5 percent had since received a
 
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's license
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
it is this dismal 84.5 unexplained
 
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
non-compliance rate that this bill seeks
 
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
the letter continues to theorize several
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
possible reasons why an individual may
 
00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:09.259 align:start position:0%
not have transferred their license
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
including they moved back out of New
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire before the 60 days were up
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
they ceased driving and gave up their
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
out-of-state driver's license before
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
these circumstances could certainly
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
occur and this bill creates a zero cost
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
form for an individual to report them to
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety and face no
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
fines penalties or fees for doing so in
 
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
a timely manner
 
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
this will allow future reports on voter
 
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:38.519 align:start position:0%
registration Integrity to include more
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
accurate information
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
and dispel the theorizing myths
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering and willful blindness
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
that seems to permeate this discussion
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
this bill also modifies RSA 654 45
 
00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:56.459 align:start position:0%
related to the information sharing from
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
the centralized voter registration
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
database operated by the Secretary of
 
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.889 align:start position:0%
database operated by the Secretary of
State

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
the modification would require the
 
00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:05.459 align:start position:0%
secretary to notify the department of
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
safety of apparent violations of 263.35
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
the database is already linked to the
 
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety for cross-checking
 
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
driver's license information with voter
 
00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
records and flagging discrepancies
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
and this new requirement would
 
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
essentially require ongoing checks
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
similar to the one run for the 2017
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
letter for voter registration records
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
with out-of-state driver's license
 
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.370 align:start position:0%
with out-of-state driver's license
information

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is also in party follow up to
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
2018's House Bill 1264 which clarified
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
the definitions of Thomas Island
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
residency in our lives effectively
 
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
making them the same thing
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
prior to this law one could in
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
circumstances circumstances be a
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
qualified voter without being subject to
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
RSA 26335
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
this is no longer the case
 
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
that law has twice been before the New
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
once due to a request for an advisory
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
opinion from the governor and Council
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
and a second time on questions certified
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
from the federal district court
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
and both times the court has addressed
 
00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:11.459 align:start position:0%
the interaction between it and RSA 26335
 
00:10:13.009 --> 00:10:13.019 align:start position:0%
and indicated that there were no
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
quoting from the Court's opinion
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
simply put the state may legitimately
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
establish procedures by which persons
 
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
who may be tempted to insincerely claim
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
domicile for voting purposes are
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
discouraged from doing so by the
 
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
prospect that such a claim can result in
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
their occurring the full penalty of
 
00:10:35.569 --> 00:10:35.579 align:start position:0%
obligations imposed on all other state
 
00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:37.250 align:start position:0%
obligations imposed on all other state
residents

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
the Court's decision continues from the
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
previous quote in a footnote indeed not
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
to correct this problem could be viewed
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
as fundamentally inconsistent with a
 
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.100 align:start position:0%
founding principle of our country
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
instead of no taxation without
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
representation current law effectively
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
allows some to obtain representation
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
without the payment of taxes or fees to
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
which other similarly situated persons
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
are subjected
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
I couldn't agree more and ask that you
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
please find this bill ought to pass and
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
make another step forward in correcting
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time consideration
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answering any questions
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
the community may have
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Amy questions
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.150 align:start position:0%
from the committee
representative

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.030 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
um

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm a little confused because
 
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm a little confused because
the

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
statute that you're amending here and
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
adding to find to
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
already is included in the uniform fine
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
schedule with a fine of 62 dollars for
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
the first offense and 124th of a second
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
so you're actually making the five
 
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.889 align:start position:0%
so you're actually making the five
smaller

00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
is that and I don't believe that is your
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
intention were you aware that there is
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
already a fine for this
 
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.750 align:start position:0%
already a fine for this
um

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.670 align:start position:0%
um
violation

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
violation
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um you are
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
correctly did not realize that there was
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
in the universe applying scheduled and
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
that I was meeting the fine smaller but
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
I think one of the changes in this bill
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
would Define would be reoccurred and
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
there would be uh Department safety
 
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to send out recurring
 
00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:16.139 align:start position:0%
notices until the situation was
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
corrected because while the current fine
 
00:12:20.769 --> 00:12:20.779 align:start position:0%
I think views it as a one-term violation
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
it at least has its looked at in this
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill it's an ongoing violation until the
 
00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:28.139 align:start position:0%
problem is corrected either by filing
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
the new forms stating why they haven't
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
transformed the driver's license or
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishing that transfer and so it's
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
an ongoing way that's looked evidence
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
bill is an ongoing violation in Turkey
 
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
instead of a one-time violation
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
let's follow it no follow-up thank you
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
so I guess I have
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
another concern with what you just said
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
that it's an ongoing fine
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in this bill that
 
00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.290 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in this bill that
states

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
how the person would be notified of a
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
potential problem and it appears as this
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
bill is written that there would be
 
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
these ongoing fines that could
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
potentially go in perpetuity
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
um potentially having a very large
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
significant fine for what might be some
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
might call more of a minor offense
 
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.430 align:start position:0%
might call more of a minor offense
um

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
is there any way that you could address
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
that concern that the the person the
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
driver is
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
going to be surprised when they're not
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
being notified that uh this is
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
actually being a fine put against
 
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.170 align:start position:0%
actually being a fine put against
something

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
um I suppose I would completely
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
concerned a friendly Amendment so that
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
the recurring clients only begin once
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
they are notified of the initial time I
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
think it would still preserve the intent
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
of the bill but certainly the intent of
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
the bill is that it's in the situation
 
00:13:50.449 --> 00:13:50.459 align:start position:0%
is considered an ongoing violation of
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
our laws until they correct
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
the discrepancy in one man or another
 
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
either by getting the license or by
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
filing one of the forms explaining why
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
they happened and why that's the correct
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
um the written test my head was a
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
handout of the 2017 letter which I
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
believe you already have to have 20
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.889 align:start position:0%
 
letterhead

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
yes I was going to ask you the same
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
question because you did provide us a
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
lot of information this should be
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
CNN thank you very much
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I didn't see it
 
00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:53.030 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I didn't see it
representative

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
I just have one last question
 
00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:57.170 align:start position:0%
I just have one last question
um

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious how you envision uh
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
this happening in terms of enforcement I
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
mean are we going to be sending people
 
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.590 align:start position:0%
mean are we going to be sending people
to

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
police to track down who might be on
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
this list I guess I just I don't
 
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.689 align:start position:0%
this list I guess I just I don't
understand

00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:15:11.699 --> 00:15:12.590 align:start position:0%
understand
um

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
is it going to be notifications VIA mail
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
what how do you envision this actually
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
being enforcement
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.449 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
especially as relates to the individuals
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
they'll be flagged we'll be sharing the
 
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
centralized voter database we already
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
have their current driver's license
 
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.350 align:start position:0%
have their current driver's license
number

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:15:37.129 --> 00:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
and I am assuming and I hope I'm correct
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we have a process to the Department
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
of Safety of sending violations out to
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
drivers where we have the driver's
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
sorry follow up and I always got that to
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
be through the mail okay sorry well I
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify if these are people
 
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
who don't have a New Hampshire
 
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.810 align:start position:0%
who don't have a New Hampshire
um

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
identification which is why they're put
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
on this list then how would the New
 
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:03.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV be able to
 
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
reach out to them
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
voting officials that operate for
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
checklist report their out-of-state
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
driver's license that they presented
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
when they did the same day registration
 
00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:19.259 align:start position:0%
that has entered into the Secretary of
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
State's database that is exactly what
 
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
they use to generate the 2017 report is
 
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579 align:start position:0%
they have both the state of issuance and
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
their driver's license information that
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
they presented during same-day
 
00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:30.889 align:start position:0%
they presented during same-day
registration

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
which it was assumingly valid at the
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
time they did that same day registration
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
and I would expect they would use that
 
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
out of state driver's license
 
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.670 align:start position:0%
out of state driver's license
information

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
to and also they would have had to
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
provide on the same same day
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
registration form their in-state address
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
from which they're attending Thomas
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
offer voted and so between that we have
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
two ways of contact a member that
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
they're out of state driver's license
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
information which I assume we have
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
understood sharing agreements for how to
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
send violations to that State Drivers or
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
their in-state the address that they
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
claimed the vote with the voting down
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
the side so we have multiple ways of
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
contact from these people to follow up
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson
 
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.549 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson
um

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
I'm a little unclear on how many people
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
are going to be involved in verifying
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
this it seems that some of this false
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office as well
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
as motor vehicle and
 
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.310 align:start position:0%
as motor vehicle and
if

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
if this sound is any amount of people at
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
all it's going to take some time to do
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
that and it seems like a financial note
 
00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
of less than ten thousand dollars is
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
probably not accurate maybe the
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State can answer that
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
better for us but uh
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of hands handling this it
 
00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.810 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of hands handling this it
seems

00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
seems
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
did you did you have a question
 
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative I do I I I'm not sure how
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
we understand that the supervisors of
 
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539 align:start position:0%
the checklist the Secretary of State's
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
office and the motor vehicle as supposed
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
to coordinate together to make this
 
00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
the advanced majority of the pieces in
 
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
this are already existing law existing
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
procedure and being done today the same
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
day voter registration information is
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
already entered into the central voter
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
registration database
 
00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:39.299 align:start position:0%
and there's already a linkage between
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
that database and the registry of motor
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles database and they already do
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
electronic comparisons looking for
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
discrepancies and have a process to
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
follow up with voters and send them
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
notifications this would just be adding
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
an additional thing they're looking for
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
in the electronic check and I think
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's part of why the costs are so low
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
that there's already all the pieces in
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
in place to do this mostly
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
electronically and so this is not a hand
 
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
check that would you know involve a
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
significant amount of additional staff
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
to cross-reference those records
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question it does
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
before I ask for any other questions
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
from the committee I just wanted to say
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
we do have somebody from the Secretary
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
of State and the Department of Motor
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
Vehicles any other questions for
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh next up
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
looks like Catherine Heck from The New
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association opposed
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members my name
 
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
is Catherine Heck from The New Hampshire
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and I am here to
 
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill based on the fact that
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
the revenues collected by and retained
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
by municipalities would be significantly
 
00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
reduced well we cannot estimate exactly
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
did I call the wrong connections we're
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
on 1643. I'm sorry sir I thought I heard
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
my name I apologize I apologize thank
 
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
um okay I'll recognize uh Olivia zinc
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
from open democracy action opposed to
 
00:20:47.649 --> 00:20:47.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Olivia Zink
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
and I'm the executive director at open
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
democracy action we're a nonpartisan
 
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
non-profit based here in Concord and we
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
really do need to modernize our election
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
system and Safeguard our elections to
 
00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:05.820 align:start position:0%
ensure that only eligible American
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
citizens are casting their ballots but
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid House Bill
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
1642 is not the way to do it this is
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
before Transportation not election law I
 
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
do think you might want to vacate this
 
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
bill and send it to election law
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
the DMV
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
residency requirements are different
 
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:30.140 align:start position:0%
than the election law domicile
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
requirements and it's important to
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
consider that and the New Hampshire
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution when you're looking at the
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
domicile res
 
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.770 align:start position:0%
domicile res
um

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
rules also getting your fishing license
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
or hunting license requires a different
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
residency requirement and I'm really
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
concerned that this bill targets college
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
students living in New Hampshire who
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
constitutionally have the right to vote
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
but may not receive a driver's license
 
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
as you know in 2006 2018 House Bill 1642
 
00:22:06.649 --> 00:22:06.659 align:start position:0%
passed after that law passed I called
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
the DMV because I was very concerned by
 
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.649 align:start position:0%
the DMV because I was very concerned by
RSA

00:22:11.649 --> 00:22:11.659 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
6263 colon 5-e which is what requires
 
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:19.220 align:start position:0%
you to get a
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
what documents you need to get a
 
00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
driver's license which is under that law
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
a lease but your dorm paperwork is not
 
00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
the same as a lease and the DMV said
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
with your dorm documents you can't get a
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's license so this
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
bill is adding a 10 a month penalty for
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
students to who don't get a driver's
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
license but then they can't get a
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
driver's license unless you amend a
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
different part of the statute to make
 
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
residency so I believe this will have a
 
00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:51.419 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on those people who want
 
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
to vote in New Hampshire who
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
constitutionally are eligible to vote in
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
also I have concerns about page 2 line
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
16 where the Secretary of State prepares
 
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
this list and I want to make sure that
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office has the
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
needed Personnel in order to prepare
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
such a list with that I'm happy to take
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
tolerski thank you thank you for taking
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:23.390 align:start position:0%
my question
um

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
is it true that you can legally
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
vote in New Hampshire with an
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
out-of-state license
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
and this residency changing your license
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
within 60 days doesn't apply to you if
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
you are not a driver
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't drive in the state of New
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you do not fall under this
 
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
requirement to change your license
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding and also I
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
believe military veterans who are
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:51.049 align:start position:0%
believe military veterans who are
serving

00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
serving
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
um and are stationed here in New
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also do not have to change
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
their license within 60 days as well
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
which is a U.S law around so you also
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
want to check in to military veterans
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
but but you're absolutely correct if
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
you're a voter who does not have a
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
driver's license this does not apply to
 
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:16.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.570 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
um

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
next up she recognizes looks like
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
Michael O'Brien two minutes from America
 
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.549 align:start position:0%
Michael O'Brien two minutes from America
votes

00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh in opposition to the bill seeking two
 
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.070 align:start position:0%
uh in opposition to the bill seeking two
minutes

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
hi everybody I'm Michael O'Brien thank
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair members of the committee
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm here on behalf of America votes I'm
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
with printing strategies uh speaking
 
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
today in opposition just a couple of
 
00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
quick things that were sort of recovered
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to waste the committee's
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
time this morning but do want to
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
re-emphasize that you can vote without a
 
00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's license is a New
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not fall into residency
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
laws and services committee knows if you
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
do not drive a vehicle
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
so the list that is being purported to
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
be sent from the Secretary of State's
 
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
office to the DMV will contain names of
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
people and essentially these folks would
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
start being into a fine schedule
 
00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:19.490 align:start position:0%
start being into a fine schedule
um

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
that do not qualify or are not
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
breaking having any violations under New
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law secondly for the rolling
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
penalty I'm not aware and I've asked
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
some lawyers some criminal lawyers who
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
are not aware of Judges sometimes for
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
contempt of court will give a rolling
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
ten dollar fine you know ten dollars a
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
day if you don't do something but those
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
those folks who have been in front of
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
those judges have already had their day
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
in court and that's where this fine
 
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:46.940 align:start position:0%
comes into effect we are unaware of any
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
statute or violation that is rolling in
 
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:51.740 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire or anywhere
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
without the person first being in front
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
of a judge or getting that fine assessed
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
to them after their day in court so for
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
someone to show up and I'll give an
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
example here it's entirely possible
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
under the statute that someone registers
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
to vote does not drive a car in New
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses an out-of-state ID gets
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
put onto this list this ten dollar fine
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
starts to reoccur because that's the way
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is written four years later
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
they get a car they decide to start
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
driving a new after they go to New
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license they have a 500 fine
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
in front of them now this person is
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
going to court have to fight this 500
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
fine which they never should have
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
accrued in the first place
 
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:33.980 align:start position:0%
um it's a whole sort of logistical mess
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh within the system because the list
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
that is being pulled for what the
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
sponsor I believe is trying to do is
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
imperfect right because again there is
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
nothing illegal about voting without a
 
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
state ID in New Hampshire
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
um you know you'll prove your domicile
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
using different documentation right ID
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
just proves who you are doesn't
 
00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:54.419 align:start position:0%
necessarily prove where you live we have
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
other documents that can do that within
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
the state and So within state law and so
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
there is nothing inherently wrong with a
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
person doing that but they will start to
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
accrue fines uh because of it I also
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
just want to point out in the case that
 
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
was mentioned around 1264.
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
in front of the Supreme Court the
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
Attorney General said in the Secretary
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
of State's office said that they would
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
not get involved in the enforcement of
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
of the law and so this would be a
 
00:27:21.889 --> 00:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
dramatic shift from that from within the
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
court case and I'm happy to forward the
 
00:27:27.889 --> 00:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
committee that documents that pertain to
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
that as well so I just want to emphasize
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
those points I think as written this
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
bill can cause a lot of problems not
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
just for students who I know were
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned but think of someone who moved
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire who lives in a nursing
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
home and now are they put on the list
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
are we sending the unfortunate question
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure was answered it was a
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
little hard to hear but are we sending
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
police to nursing homes to find seniors
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
who use an out-of-state ID to vote but
 
00:27:56.049 --> 00:27:56.059 align:start position:0%
again these seniors wouldn't qualify
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
under motor vehicle law because they're
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
maybe not driving here what is the next
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
step in this enforcement proceeding and
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
I think it can cause a lot of unforeseen
 
00:28:05.159 --> 00:28:06.549 align:start position:0%
I think it can cause a lot of unforeseen
problems

00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
that aren't necessarily fixes to
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
anything that we have and system right
 
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
now so happy to take any questions but
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.190 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
seeing that I have one I've heard that
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh for example college students aren't
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
required to get their license changed to
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire after well within the 60
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
days if they don't drive
 
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.990 align:start position:0%
days if they don't drive
correct

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
or anybody my question is how is it
 
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
determined or proven whether they're
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
driving or not
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
well I mean that's I mean that's a fair
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
question but I think that goes
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know we're not asking people nor I
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
think could we when they vote do you
 
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
drive a vehicle right but that's the
 
00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:51.419 align:start position:0%
same it's not just students right so
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
again the senior in the nursing home who
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
goes and registers to vote who goes to a
 
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
nursing home in New Hampshire maybe move
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
from Mass to get closer to family or
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be we're not
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
asking them either you know are you
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
driving a vehicle
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
um and so what what happens here is
 
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
you're going to have this list that is
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
factually inaccurate it's going to
 
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
contain people people are going to start
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
accruing fines because there is no
 
00:29:17.769 --> 00:29:17.779 align:start position:0%
verification system within this list who
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
should not be doing that we're going to
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
end up with unnecessary court cases and
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
costs we'll also say from a burning
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
rights perspective under the sb3 case
 
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
the state just paid out five million
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
dollars to the law firm who sued the
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
state over the law and I'm sure if this
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
were to pass we'd be right back at it
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
again and I'm not sure the state wants
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
to start cutting checks and perpetuity
 
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
so I think we have to be very careful
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
when we make changes around election law
 
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
because these changes can oftentimes
 
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
lead to lawsuits and oftentimes the
 
00:29:48.409 --> 00:29:48.419 align:start position:0%
state can spend a lot more money than is
 
00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:50.710 align:start position:0%
state can spend a lot more money than is
necessary

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you anything you can provide to
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
the committee would be appreciated it's
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
not always easy to hear and hear a lot
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
more information any other questions
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
seeing on thank you very much thank you
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes Bob Perry
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
representing himself in opposition to
 
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
the bill seeking four minutes I hope you
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
good morning all
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
I speak in opposition to 1643
 
00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
challenging Donald Trump's protestations
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
of massive voter fraud in the 2020 New
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire election
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
and relative the Wyndham audit which
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
produced no evidence of voter fraud
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
several quotes were captured by wmui's
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
John distaso
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
quoting the governor quote a discrepancy
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
of 300 votes out of over 800 000 cast
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
does not constitute massive voter fraud
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
in fact it is proof that New Hampshire's
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
voting process is the most reliable
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
safe and secure in the country and that
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
we will ensure every last vote is
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
accurately accounted for end quote
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
in a late afternoon briefing the
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
governor added quote if anything I think
 
00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:18.419 align:start position:0%
the fact that we focused on 300 votes
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
goes to the Integrity of our system we
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
a system where we will do an audit even
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
if it is over a couple hundred votes end
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
quote he continued quote I don't know of
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
any other state that goes to such
 
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:39.260 align:start position:0%
extents but here our system
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
99.9 percent worked absolutely
 
00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:46.100 align:start position:0%
wonderfully end quote
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
in another quote we are the model of
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
that other states want to be frankly end
 
00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:53.930 align:start position:0%
that other states want to be frankly end
quote

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
quote
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
despite the governor's exuberance for
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of New Hampshire's
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
elections it has not stopped the
 
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:01.940 align:start position:0%
legislature from considering bills that
 
00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:04.019 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily complicate the voting
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
process and infers voter bad faith
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
the language modifying current law is
 
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.009 align:start position:0%
the language modifying current law is
dystopia

an individual's information is derived

from an out-of-state driver's license

John a fictitious name but a real person
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
told me he was living temporarily in

town B while waiting for final repairs
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
and sale of his home in town a
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
he was also waiting for his new home to

be built in town C
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances would you deny
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
him his freedom to vote because the
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
legislature argues over which town he
 
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
should consider his domicile
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
which town would you tell him he should
 
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
vote from town a b or c
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
would it be town a because that's where
 
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:54.419 align:start position:0%
he had established his domicile for
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
voting purposes even though he has moved
 
00:33:59.210 --> 00:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
and looks forward to establishing voting
 
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
rights in town C
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
would you require he vote in town B
 
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
because that's where he has a physical
 
00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.430 align:start position:0%
because that's where he has a physical
presence

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
presence
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
if I were to add that this person moved
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
from out of state and was yet to
 
00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
establish residency or domicile at
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
either towns a b or c
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
would you deny him his constitutional
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
right to vote anywhere in New Hampshire
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
you would if you you would if John threw
 
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:28.940 align:start position:0%
up his arms in frustration and concluded
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
voting is just too dangerous
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
this bill emerges a constitutional right
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
to vote with the privilege of driving an
 
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.990 align:start position:0%
to vote with the privilege of driving an
automobile

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
automobile
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
we are a mobile Society
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
residency is a state of mind
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
domicile is a state of mind
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
both are as fluid as life itself
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
especially for young people
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
one legal definition cannot serve to
 
00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:57.260 align:start position:0%
successfully contemplate all of life's
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
unknowns but we have historically
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
settled on one legal definition for
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
domicile found at 654-1
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
which for many years has successfully
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
served the interests of the state and
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
its voters
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
I urge itl
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
and I'll take no questions
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for reading your written
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
testimony to us
 
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes David Scanlon Secretary
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
of State
 
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
State and I'm here not taking a position
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
on this bill but to provide you with
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
some information
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me I certainly understand where
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of this bill are coming
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
from and I'm a firm believer that to be
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
a voter in New Hampshire you should be
 
00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
you have to be a resident and have your
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.650 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that you're dealing with today
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
and it kind of interacts with our
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
election laws
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
the part that that I would like to bring
 
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
to your attention is on page two
 
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.329 align:start position:0%
to your attention is on page two
lines

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
14 through 18.
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
currently when a voter comes in to
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
register to vote they have to fill out a
 
00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:26.579 align:start position:0%
voter registration form
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
and that form requires certain
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
information to be provided
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
some of the information is required by
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
the federal government specifically to
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
help America vote Act
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
which says that a voter should provide
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
their their driver's license number
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
or if they don't have that the last four
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
digits of their social security number
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have that a random
 
00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
number voter number is assigned to that
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
individual for purposes of
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
the voter does not have to provide a
 
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle license and so most voters
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
do but there are quite a few voters who
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
have not provided that information
 
00:37:16.609 --> 00:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
subsequent to registering to vote every
 
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
time after that that a voter goes into a
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
polling place to cast their vote
 
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
they have to present some form of
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
acceptable ID
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
that ID can be a driver's license it can
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
be an out-of-state driver's license and
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
it can be an expired license same would
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
be true with a passport or other
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
documentation that the local election
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
officials team appropriate
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
and if a voter has none of those things
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
they can meet that requirement by
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
signing an affidavit and having their
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
photograph taken
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to continue to
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
provide a driver's license to be able to
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
the requirement on page two says that
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
when an individual's record in the voter
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
database contains information derived
 
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:12.540 align:start position:0%
from an out-of-state driver's license
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State shall notify the
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
department of safety of apparent
 
00:38:17.579 --> 00:38:19.250 align:start position:0%
department of safety of apparent
violations

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
violations
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
of RSA 263 colon 35 and I I would
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
suggest that we as as the Department of
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
State are in no position to make a
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
judgment on whether there is an apparent
 
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
as a requirement of the help America
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
vote Act
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office does
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
have to match our state voter database
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
up with a motor vehicle database on a
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
regular basis
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
and what that match does is it kicks out
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
voters names and addresses where there
 
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
are where it looks like it's the same
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
voter but there's a mismatch in the
 
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.890 align:start position:0%
voter but there's a mismatch in the
information

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
and that is done so that that
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
information can be reconciled and it's
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
done primarily on the motor vehicle land
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
if as a matter of policy this committee
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
decides that it would be useful to
 
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.950 align:start position:0%
decides that it would be useful to
provide

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
out of state driver's license
 
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
information and
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
voter registration dates to the DMV so
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
that they could make a determination on
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
whether there were
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
a term here
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
apparent violations of the statute then
 
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:35.780 align:start position:0%
as the enforcement Authority for that
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
statute they would be able to look into
 
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.650 align:start position:0%
statute they would be able to look into
it

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
administers the elections we don't have
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
any enforcement authority over elections
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
that role is in the in the realm of the
 
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
um so I'll stop there Mr chairman and I
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
if the committee has any
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative pilersky
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for taking
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
my question this morning
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
sharing of public and sharing of the
 
00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
voter list
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
um in 654
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's four or five it lays out
 
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.130 align:start position:0%
I think it's four or five it lays out
um

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
if this information is considered
 
00:40:29.569 --> 00:40:29.579 align:start position:0%
private and how it can be shared into
 
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
what entities
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
can you does statute even allow you to
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
share that kind of information with
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
other departments
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
the Acoustics in here are not great so I
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
think I heard your question if I didn't
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
don't answer properly just let me know
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I the Secretary of State's office
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
maintains the Statewide centralized
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
voter database
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
and the information that the voter
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
provides on their voter registration
 
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
form is confidential except for that
 
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
information which is spelled out in the
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
statute appears on the public voter
 
00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:07.490 align:start position:0%
statute appears on the public voter
checklist

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
so any citizen in the state has the
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
right to look at the voter checklist see
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
a voter's name
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
see that voter's mailing address and and
 
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
physical address
 
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:21.740 align:start position:0%
they can see their party affiliation
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
and I believe the voter identification
 
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.410 align:start position:0%
and I believe the voter identification
number

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
I know that the
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
Department of our vehicles has a
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
database of their own and they they
 
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:37.940 align:start position:0%
protect that information and the privacy
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
of those uh you know of those murder
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
Vehicle drivers in fact the databases of
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
both agencies are kept confidential
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
except to the extent that we can match
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
the databases up against each other
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
no no department is actually pulling
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
information from the other all that
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
spits out of the of the comparison or
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
those mismatches that need some form of
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
reconciliation so we're not taking
 
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
information from the motor vehicle
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
database and they're not taking
 
00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.829 align:start position:0%
database and they're not taking
information

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
from the Statewide voter database
 
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any leaks that have
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
occurred through that process I know
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the elections database
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
we do everything that we can to maintain
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
the privacy of
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
the confidential information that voters
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
can I I just want to clarify one thing
 
00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:38.780 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing that would prevent
 
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office from
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
sharing this list of Voters with
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
out-of-state driver's licenses with the
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.809 --> 00:42:56.819 align:start position:0%
week by federal statute we can we can
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
match our databases
 
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.910 align:start position:0%
match our databases
um

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
right to to to to share more than we're
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
sharing now would require legislation
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
which is in your domain and uh and
 
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision that that I
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
seeing that I just have one you did
 
00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
indicate at the beginning that you may
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
you might see some merits of this and
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
some understanding has there been a
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with you on the prime
 
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
sponsor about maybe seeing something in
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
it that's amenable I'd be happy to have
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
a conversation with prime sponsor thank
 
00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:35.990 align:start position:0%
a conversation with prime sponsor thank
you

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh the
 
00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:41.660 align:start position:0%
last speaker on House Bill 1643
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
Kelly brednick from the Department of
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:50.339 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Kelly bruniak
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety Division
 
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles thank you for letting
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
me speak today I will be brief the
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles does oppose
 
00:43:59.329 --> 00:43:59.339 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
we feel at this point it's unclear in
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
many areas including how the lane
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
language shall be enforced by whom how
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
to calculate the fees there's several
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
questions that it brings up you know one
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
to bring up when someone becomes a
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
resident they do come in to get their
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
driver's license they provide residency
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
but they are not required to provide
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
when they became that Resident so we
 
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
would have to add different mechanisms
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
and how to track that how do they prove
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
when they became a resident so we feel
 
00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
that this bill leaves a lot of questions
 
00:44:35.809 --> 00:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
more than answers I can go into more
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
detail and answer any questions that you
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
may have
 
00:44:41.569 --> 00:44:41.579 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thank
 
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question when you have
 
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state
 
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
person comes in and wants to get a New
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license what exactly
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
is that process what what documents must
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
they show
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
and prove that there are a New Hampshire
 
00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:08.270 align:start position:0%
and prove that there are a New Hampshire
resident

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
resident
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so coming in
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
from out of state there are several
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
documents that they must prove they must
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
provide to us they need to prove who
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
they are typically that is in the form
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
of a birth certificate I'm only giving
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
you one the common the most common way
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
they do have to provide proof of their
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
social security is one of the other
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
documents that they have to provide they
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
do also have to provide if they have
 
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
driven in the past they would have to
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
provide their right to drive and that
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
would be that out of state driver's
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
license they also would provide
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
residency there are many things that we
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
would accept for residency one of them
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
rental or a lease agreement some of
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
those may have when it starts some of
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
them may not some people may live with a
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
family member so they would get a
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
notarized statement but again we do not
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
currently require them to tell us the
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
date in which they became a resident
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
just to prove that they are our website
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
currently does list all of our required
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
documents so we can go over those if
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
you'd like but also you can check those

that's Mr chair
 
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
gonna take a minute to get used to the
 
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Chief Ammon I
 
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsborough District 40 and
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's the towns of
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
New Boston Milford Mount Vernon and
 
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.170 align:start position:0%
New Boston Milford Mount Vernon and
Hollis

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
Hollis
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
and I apologize the delay is kind of
 
00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:20.099 align:start position:0%
messing with my uh
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
my ability to speak here
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
if you want to you can back up just a
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
little bit keep going back how about
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
there we can hear you yeah we'll have to
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
back away
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
I'm practically whispering right now
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
usually do that and hear me clearly
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
right okay Softly so with all that's
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
going on in the world right now this
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
might seem like a minor issue
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
the gist of the bill is to reduce
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
we know that uh
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
registration fees for automobiles
 
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
generate significant revenue for towns
 
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:05.870 align:start position:0%
generate significant revenue for towns
um

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
we also know that
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
inflation is occurring
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
and the new car prices especially are up
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
over 10 around 10 percent uh year over
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
year so
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
the registration fees are based on the
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
list price of an automobile
 
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.730 align:start position:0%
list price of an automobile
so

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
if you look at the text of the bill it's
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
very simple bill it really just rolls
 
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
our millage rate forward one year
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
so there's five years
 
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
first year is the highest and we all
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
know this when we pay our registration
 
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.410 align:start position:0%
know this when we pay our registration
fee

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
it rolls It Forward from so it makes
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
year two year one year three year two
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
to alleviate some of the cost
 
00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:54.410 align:start position:0%
to alleviate some of the cost
of

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration fees
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
a new vehicle can be somewhere between
 
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
forty and fifty thousand dollars we're
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
getting to that point unless you're
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to buy a Honda Civic you know a
 
00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
stripped down vehicle
 
00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:11.819 align:start position:0%
and some people especially for work
 
00:52:11.819 --> 00:52:13.190 align:start position:0%
and some people especially for work
trucks

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
trucks
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
an F-150
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's usable for say a landscaper
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
can be somewhere around 65 to 70
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and so the registration
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
fee for the first year can be over one
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
and I don't know about you but a
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
registration fee to me means that you
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
register your vehicle but
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally in New Hampshire this fee
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
has been used as more of a property tax
 
00:52:41.809 --> 00:52:41.819 align:start position:0%
so there's a fee that goes to the state
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
that's fixed that's very small
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
with the military that goes to the town
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
is much higher
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
so I looked up the history of this law
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
because that's always a good place to
 
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.730 align:start position:0%
because that's always a good place to
start

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:54.740 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
the millage rate was established for
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles in 1919 so 100 years ago
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
and it was a four-year stepped rate the
 
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
first year was 17 Mills
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's a 17 per thousand
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
the second year was 12 Mills
 
00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
third year was nine Mills
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
the uh I'm sorry
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
I think what 1712 953 so that's
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
zero to four years
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
then it's in 1921 it was raised to 24
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
Mills rate so it went it went way up
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
20 in 1925 it came down again and it
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
stayed that way 17 mils is the highest
 
00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579 align:start position:0%
until 1975.
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
in 19 between 1975 and 1980 is where we
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
get our current Village rate
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
so that's just some history that this
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
these numbers have fluctuated over the
 
00:53:50.579 --> 00:53:52.010 align:start position:0%
these numbers have fluctuated over the
years

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
now we're going to hear opposition and
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's understandable that this money even
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
though it's for automobiles and we know
 
00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
automobiles use roads and bridges they
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
might even use the fire department
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the police department
 
00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:04.730 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the police department
sometimes

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
but this money goes into the general
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
fund of the town so the town can spend
 
00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
it on whatever it wants
 
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
so we're going to hear that towns will
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
be affected their General Revenue will
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
be affected and that is that is
 
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
certainly the case if we change this
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's one of the
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's one of the genius things about that
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
instilling this in the first place and
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to touch it's difficult
 
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
I had legislative research look up a
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
cross-section of towns to do every town
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
would have been too big of a task
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
to ask them to do so I had them do you
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
know the biggest cities to some small
 
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.230 align:start position:0%
know the biggest cities to some small
towns

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
and it turns out the biggest cities they
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
their motor vehicle fees I'll give you
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
an example so Manchester gets about 14
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year in motor
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
vehicle fees and on public works that
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
would be roads and bridges and street
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
so Manchester would be the biggest
 
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
example they spend double what they take
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
in on public works if you just want to
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
consider it public works
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
but if you look at a small town like
 
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.370 align:start position:0%
but if you look at a small town like
Stratham

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
Stratham
 
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
the population about 7 500.
 
00:55:21.289 --> 00:55:21.299 align:start position:0%
they've taken almost two million dollars
 
00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
in motor vehicle fees and they spend
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
about half a million dollars on public
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
works on roads and bridges so they're
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
they're taking a significant
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
four times they're taking four times
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
what they spend on roads and bridges
 
00:55:36.609 --> 00:55:36.619 align:start position:0%
and that varies across the state
 
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
this fee is set in statute by the state
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
legislature so it does affect every town
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
but if you looked if you think about a
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
kitchen table issue when you're going to
 
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
pay on your birthday month happy
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
birthday you get to pay a thousand
 
00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
dollars for your F-150 that you need for
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
your Landscaping Company
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
this bill would be designed to lessen
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
that burden a little bit and it would
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
require towns and cities to readjust
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh how they spend their money
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
one possible change to this bill this is
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
my final thought
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
is perhaps we could Target the money
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
spent on just things that apply to
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
automobiles within a town and then maybe
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
the money left over would go to a state
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
fund you know this would maybe alleviate
 
00:56:30.289 --> 00:56:30.299 align:start position:0%
that issue where
 
00:56:32.089 --> 00:56:32.099 align:start position:0%
you know it goes to a general fund it
 
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
can be spent on things that don't have
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
anything to do with automobiles if we
 
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:39.140 align:start position:0%
maybe could focus it just on
 
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:41.579 align:start position:0%
automotive automotive expenditures that
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
might be a the beginning of kind of
 
00:56:48.289 --> 00:56:48.299 align:start position:0%
tying this to actual expenses
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
so those are my thoughts on this bill if
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I'll be happy to
 
00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:53.750 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I'll be happy to
answer

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony could you
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
get us those statistics that you were
 
00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
talking about as far as how much money
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
that the cities and towns have taken in
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
get it to the committee somehow yeah
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'll go make a copy of this right now
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
it's not written testimony but it is a
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet okay hold on any questions
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski thank you thank
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I find is just lacking
 
00:57:25.569 --> 00:57:25.579 align:start position:0%
on this bill is the fiscal note
 
00:57:28.089 --> 00:57:28.099 align:start position:0%
understandably it's extremely difficult
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
to figure out how this is going to
 
00:57:33.289 --> 00:57:33.299 align:start position:0%
affect towns I do not and the fact that
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's listed as indeterminable with just
 
00:57:39.650 --> 00:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
a sixty six thousand dollar expense is
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
problematic when we look at the total
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's collected
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
Statewide on this I know my city
 
00:57:45.839 --> 00:57:47.750 align:start position:0%
Statewide on this I know my city
treasurer

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.430 align:start position:0%
treasurer
um

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
expressed how devastating this could be
 
00:57:54.289 --> 00:57:54.299 align:start position:0%
for my for my uh town where I live
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
perhaps give us an idea of how a town is
 
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:02.819 align:start position:0%
going to make up the difference in order
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
to maintain the roads that these
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you so you're speaking again to
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
this issue where this money goes into
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
even though we're taxing automobiles
 
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.260 align:start position:0%
that could go to
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
to fund anything that the city decides
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
to do so to me we call this a
 
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
registration fee but it's really an
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
additional property tax we already have
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
some of the highest property taxes in
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
we also have some of the highest
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
registration fees around the country so
 
00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.170 align:start position:0%
registration fees around the country so
um

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
to me it's the issue of
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
the principle of taxing someone's
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
automobile but not spending that money
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
on things the automobile uses right
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's kind of the
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
the structural flaw in the original Law
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
representative Airman
 
00:59:06.059 --> 00:59:06.950 align:start position:0%
representative Airman
um

00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
the thing that it puzzles me is that
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
how you talk about this registration
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
fees being in effect a tax a property
 
00:59:18.299 --> 00:59:19.309 align:start position:0%
fees being in effect a tax a property
tax

00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
and yet if you take away those funds
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
from all the cities and towns
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
they're probably the only mechanism they
 
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
have remaining to replace that revenue
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
is to increase property taxes
 
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
and I I think you're just giving you
 
00:59:37.849 --> 00:59:37.859 align:start position:0%
know giving it back here and taking it
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
back over here
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
is that is that accurate
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with that statement
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's more that the fact that the whole
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
thing is a shell game
 
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
you know you're you're taking money
 
00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying you're you're
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
requiring people to pay a fee for a
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
registration fee for their automobile
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
but that is such a significant amount
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
that in a lot of these small towns it
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
goes to paying for lots of other things
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
that are not related to automobiles
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
so I have a follow-up if you may
 
01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:15.299 align:start position:0%
it's thank you Mr chairman
 
01:00:15.299 --> 01:00:16.910 align:start position:0%
it's thank you Mr chairman
um

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
the other part of this problem that I
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
have is that
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
give and essentially you're giving a tax
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
break to people who are not property
 
01:00:27.059 --> 01:00:28.010 align:start position:0%
break to people who are not property
owners

01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
owners
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
and forcing Property Owners to make up
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
01:00:33.289 --> 01:00:33.299 align:start position:0%
how is that Equitable that's a great
 
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
question and this is something that most
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
people don't think about unless you're
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
homeless unless you're living on the
 
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
street you're living inside of an
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
apartment or a condo or house
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
that house that condo that apartment
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
might be owned by someone else that
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
someone else pays the property taxes and
 
01:00:53.809 --> 01:00:53.819 align:start position:0%
passes those taxes on to the renter so
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative O'Hara thank you Mr
 
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to make sure I'm
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
understanding what I think you're trying
 
01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
to do with this bill
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
all right it sounds like you'd be
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
amendable to making towns have to have
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
separate funds if they get this money
 
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
and work on streets and stuff like that
 
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
right so they can specify it's for
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
automobile is that kind of your
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
Direction with this
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's one potential Direction
 
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.710 align:start position:0%
that's one potential Direction
um

01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
so the current mill rate is 18 down to
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
three dollars yeah so maybe 15 is too is
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
too low maybe we can go more
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
traditionally with 17 12 9.
 
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
five and three that that's the way it
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
was for majority of the last hundred
 
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:48.710 align:start position:0%
was for majority of the last hundred
years

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
but that that would be another potential
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so it and last
 
01:01:59.329 --> 01:01:59.339 align:start position:0%
question would be if we do lower the
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
rate and we ask the town to increase
 
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
death increase in property tax clearly
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
that money will go in the general fund
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
and the people of the town will then see
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
actually how much the town is costing
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
them rather than trying to mix the
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
property tax and registration fee
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
together see how much it cost them
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
that would certainly be a way to go I
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how popular it would be with
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
the Town Administrator but at least the
 
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
money that you pay for your car goes to
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
things that your car uses includes
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:30.299 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
01:02:30.299 --> 01:02:33.349 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
next up
 
01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:42.109 align:start position:0%
next up
Catherine

01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
Catherine
 
01:02:42.119 --> 01:02:45.349 align:start position:0%
Catherine
heck

01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:47.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association I
 
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.650 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association I
think

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members and I
 
01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
apologize for being a little early on my
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
testimony before yesterday was a holiday
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
so I guess today is my Monday so my name
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
is Catherine heck I am with the New
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and I am
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
the government Finance advisor we are
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to House Bill
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
1570 as vehicle registrations are the
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
second largest source of Municipal
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue in our communities monthly
 
01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
registrations provide consistent revenue
 
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
streams assist with cash flow and
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of money that has to
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
be raised in local property tax a
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
reduction in motor vehicle fees equates
 
01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
to raising the property tax to make up
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
for this reduction
 
01:03:36.829 --> 01:03:36.839 align:start position:0%
this legislation reduces the amount of
 
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
Revenue retained and collected as
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
unrestricted by the municipalities the
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
town permit fee as you've heard in
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
testimony is based on the model year the
 
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
factory list price and the expiration
 
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
date of the registration I will note
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
that it is not possible for us to
 
01:03:54.609 --> 01:03:54.619 align:start position:0%
calculate the predict precise reduction
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
by registration information because that
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
is not broken down and the data we can
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
collect by model year by town
 
01:04:06.049 --> 01:04:06.059 align:start position:0%
I did submit a fiscal note when the LSR
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
came out the full note was not included
 
01:04:11.569 --> 01:04:11.579 align:start position:0%
on the bill so I will testify with that
 
01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
information now
 
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
using the revenue collected the actual
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue collected in 2019 and now I do
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
have the information for 20 which was
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
not available last November
 
01:04:26.089 --> 01:04:26.099 align:start position:0%
I calculated the degrees and fees by
 
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
percentage using the average of the six
 
01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
permitting fees
 
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
rather than using the simple average
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
calculation mathematically I use the
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
geometric mean because that uses a
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
central tendency and tosses out the high
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
and low outliers because again we can't
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
calculate by model year
 
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
296.7 million dollars was collected in
 
01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:53.339 align:start position:0%
Municipal motor vehicle registration
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
fees the data source is the New
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Finance Consortium you
 
01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
can get this data
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
it's accessible to anyone at
 
01:05:01.619 --> 01:05:06.230 align:start position:0%
it's accessible to anyone at
www.nhpfc.org

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
so when using that geometric mean the
 
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
reduction is about 90 million dollars a
 
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
year based on 2020 information
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
in 2019 approximately 289
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
000 was collected and we estimate again
 
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:24.020 align:start position:0%
using that mathematical calculation
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
80.4 million dollar reduction
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
so just to put this in some perspective
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
the legislature last session generously
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
increased your meals and rooms to
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities at the 30 percent level
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
and this would essentially zero out that
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar meals and rooms
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we had seen so therefore having no
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
additional effect on reducing taxation
 
01:05:50.329 --> 01:05:50.339 align:start position:0%
because we would have to be making up
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
for that so
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
I can take any questions that you might
 
01:05:54.119 --> 01:05:55.370 align:start position:0%
I can take any questions that you might
have

01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
any questions for this Witness
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
representative O'Hara
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just want to see
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
if we could get the data that she just
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.529 --> 01:06:18.539 align:start position:0%
when we're done with you ma'am would you
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of your testimony
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
that she could have I I do not have a
 
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:26.579 align:start position:0%
copy but I can certainly email it to you
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
right after the presentation absolutely
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
that's about my pay grade but she knows
 
01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:06:41.569 --> 01:06:41.579 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that if this gets
 
01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:44.579 align:start position:0%
reduced that we automatically is going
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
to make an increase in property taxes
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
are there other other areas
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
that can be impacted versus property
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
taxes and what I mean by that is have we
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
looked at any other areas to make this
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
or even look at maybe
 
01:07:02.569 --> 01:07:02.579 align:start position:0%
you know making some looking in other
 
01:07:02.579 --> 01:07:03.890 align:start position:0%
you know making some looking in other
areas

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question and
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the revenue side when we
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
set the tax rate offsets you know we
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
reduce the tax the tax amount of
 
01:07:15.529 --> 01:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
appropriated expenditures that the town
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
approves we subtract the revenues and
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
that's how we get to the tax rate so
 
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
unfortunately any reduction in revenues
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
you had asked previously if I may about
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
um money is being dedicated to Road in
 
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
Bridge work this RSA that allows for the
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
collection of Motor Vehicle fees already
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
has a provision for the cities and towns
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
to raise an additional optional
 
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
transportation fee tax for those who are
 
01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:46.849 align:start position:0%
transportation fee tax for those who are
already

01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
exceeding on the dollar amount that they
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
collect in motor vehicle fees for their
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
Road and Bridge work
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
so there is an optional tax that 35
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
communities currently have enacted since
 
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
1996 to additionally offset that so
 
01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.710 align:start position:0%
1996 to additionally offset that so
they're

01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
to look at a bigger picture to your
 
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
point I'm not seeing an easy solution on
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
where we could adjust so it doesn't hit
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
the local property tax rate does that
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
answer your question sir
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are you
 
01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
aware of any studies that have been done
 
01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:28.910 align:start position:0%
aware of any studies that have been done
that

01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
a tribute by percent or other method to
 
01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:35.149 align:start position:0%
a tribute by percent or other method to
what

01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
a property tax might be for rental
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
properties versus the rent that they
 
01:08:39.719 --> 01:08:40.849 align:start position:0%
properties versus the rent that they
charge

01:08:40.849 --> 01:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir I'm having trouble hearing
 
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
you could you repeat the question I do
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
apologize no I'll get closer is that
 
01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:49.259 align:start position:0%
better yes sir sorry are you aware of
 
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
any studies
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
that show the connections or the
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
attribution to rents that are charged
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
and and how much that property tax May
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
factor into that
 
01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:03.659 align:start position:0%
I I do believe there are studies from

the fiscal policy Institute that discuss
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
how tenants are charged based on
 
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
taxation I could try to find them for
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
you and send them along sir that'd be
 
01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
go ahead I'm just curious
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
um when you asked for a testimony on on
 
01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
the um the data that she had may I
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
requested that go to the whole committee
 
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
I just don't know if she was going to
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
send it directly to uh the clerk or
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's a good question may I ask that it
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
be sent to the whole committee sure for
 
01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
that for that fiscal note information
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
would you send it to the whole committee
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
please yes sir thank you thank you
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%

Association

01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
how'd I do
 
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
um so I won't repeat the municipal
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
Association said a lot of things that I
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
was going to say so I'm not going to
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
repeat that so I'm just going to get
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
down to the basics
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
um Milford alone
 
01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
lose six hundred thousand dollars the
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
first year if this bill passes
 
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:31.820 align:start position:0%
if it passes in the middle of a year
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
we've already calculated our budgets I
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
don't know where we're going to capture
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
this These funds that are missing the
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
city and took Clerk's Association did a
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
calculation on Salem New Hampshire they
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
um what I want to mention is what we're
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
forgetting is after the vehicle is five
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
years old it goes down to lowest mill
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
rate so you're getting your lower
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
straight after five years if like me
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
because I register cars every day when I
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
buy a new car I buy a new three or four
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
or five year old car I don't buy a new
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
new car so
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is is that businesses
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
aren't rentals
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
businesses build the cost of registering
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
these vehicles into the cost of doing
 
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.410 align:start position:0%
these vehicles into the cost of doing
business

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:20.420 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
if we lose their vehicle registration
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
rates on the businesses
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
that all of that is just going to
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
property tax I mean and it's not it's
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
not hitting rentals I mean a lot of
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
businesses have just a little one
 
01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
building and they've they're renting
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
cars or they're it's a parking lot but
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
they store their vehicles in so you're
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
not gaining anything from them paying
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
more property tax
 
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
more property tax
um

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
and you know and you have to keep in
 
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
mind you know when he mentioned that it
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
not all that money is being spent on
 
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.010 align:start position:0%
not all that money is being spent on
roads

01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
roads
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
that you've got it's DPW it's fire and
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
its police those are all all should be
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
combined together when the when the
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
money in our everything that we're
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
collecting in Milford is going to those
 
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
three departments
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
um other states what I see when we
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
register Vehicles some people come in
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
and they they get that you know first
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill obviously everybody's buying trucks
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
right now trucks are the most expensive
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
thing vehicle to to register but if you
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
were in Vermont Maine Massachusetts
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
you'd be paying sales tax more than what
 
01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
our registration cost is I mean you have
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
to look at why are people always trying
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
to figure out a New Hampshire address so
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
they can register their vehicles because
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
it's where the cheapest place in the
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
area to register vehicles
 
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.490 align:start position:0%
area to register vehicles
um

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
basically I mean we have two places to
 
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
collect revenues in the town and it's
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles and property tax and this
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
is just a shift to property tax
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
any questions for those witness but keep
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
in mind that we are almost 15 minutes
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
let me open with an apology in my 12
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
years serving in the legislature it was
 
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
the first time I've ever set foot in
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
this historic chamber without a tie I
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
had to switch cars unexpectedly there it
 
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
is ironic that we're talking about
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
apparel today and no it's not a stunt I
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
would have come here with no sleeves and
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
jeans that worked for a living if it was
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
a stunt
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bill it's a bill that
 
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
says you can't be stopped you team to
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
search because of what you chose to wear
 
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.330 align:start position:0%
search because of what you chose to wear
today

01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's all it does there should have
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
zero impact on law enforcement however
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
if it does then that's certainly proof
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill was needed
 
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
if you're wearing motorcycle
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia don't giggle
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
you can't be stopped just because you're
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
wearing that I got asked a question
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
yesterday that kind of wound me up so
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
does this mean we can't pull over
 
01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
anybody wearing a Hell's Angels jacket
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's silly what they can't be pulled
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
over for is wearing the jacket however
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
if it's part of a description and a
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
crime that just happened of course
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
here's a scenario
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
a business gets robbed the description
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
of the purp goes out it's a five foot
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
tall white male weighing 135 pounds with
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
blue hair wearing a Harry Potter t-shirt
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
now if within a mile of the business you
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
find this Harry Potter wearing
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
blue-haired Vespa riding perp
 
01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
he matches the description yes you can
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
pull him over he's being stopped to
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
Tandem question because he matches the
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
description not because he was wearing
 
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
the Harry Potter t-shirt now I ask you
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
to consider that scenario and substitute
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
a rolling thunder jacket a red Electra
 
01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.669 align:start position:0%
a rolling thunder jacket a red Electra
Glide

01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
Glide
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
shouldn't laws apply to everybody
 
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
equally it shouldn't matter what our
 
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
wardrobe Choice was today
 
01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
my name's at the top but this is the
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
speaker's bill
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
he cares deeply about this and is
 
01:23:01.129 --> 01:23:01.139 align:start position:0%
actually himself experienced some
 
01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
discrimination I don't know if you guys
 
01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
know what he looks like when he's not
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
here but it might surprise you
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
look around the room you're going to see
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
people wearing that dangerous motorcycle
 
01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia but let me tell you what
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
you do see
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
UC New Hampshire you see professionals
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
you see people working regular jobs you
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
see veterans retirees you see people
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
engaged in worthy causes I saw a bunch
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
of people walk in sit in front of me
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
wearing what's said Bikers Against Child
 
01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.390 align:start position:0%
wearing what's said Bikers Against Child
Abuse

01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
Abuse
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
they do all of these things because
 
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
they're just regular people like you and
 
01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be discriminated against
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
both of our sides have some common
 
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
themes on one side I hear Freedom
 
01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:44.990 align:start position:0%
themes on one side I hear Freedom
Liberty

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
Liberty
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
to be free from government interference
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
when I'm going about my life I hear that
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
we should have a welcoming inclusive
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
environment where everybody has the same
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
Equity opportunities and is not
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
persecuted because of what they look
 
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:02.060 align:start position:0%
like what I'm asking the committee today
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
is to affirm all that tell these people
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
that we mean it and pass this Bill thank
 
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski
 
01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
um I love the idea of this and I'm
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
wondering why we have to limit it to
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
motorcycle riders are there other
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
classes that we could protect
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry my hearing a shot could you do
 
01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:31.900 align:start position:0%
that again sorry
 
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.470 align:start position:0%
that again sorry
[Music]

01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be slow and loud
 
01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
I was going to say I love the idea of
 
01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
the Bill I'm wondering why we
 
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
have to restrict it to Simply Riders of
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
motorcycles are there any other classes
 
01:24:52.330 --> 01:24:52.340 align:start position:0%
that we could protect from this kind of
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
action by profiling them
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
but what I mean profiling in general we
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
already have profiling laws
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
um that there are certainly state and
 
01:25:04.729 --> 01:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
federal laws and I mean really shouldn't
 
01:25:07.129 --> 01:25:07.139 align:start position:0%
it just be that you can't be treated
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
differently because of what you look
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
like and this isn't currently on the
 
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
books so we just like to put it there
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:18.649 --> 01:25:18.659 align:start position:0%

from Salem New Hampshire uh I have one
 
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:44.810 align:start position:0%
from Salem New Hampshire uh I have one
question

01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
what do I do for a living
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
well I'll tell you what I do for a
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
living I'm the director of I.T for a
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%

01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
I've worked for MIT the Library of

classes for IBM
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
I've been stopped just because I was
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
wearing leather
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
that was the only reason why I was
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
stopped there was no other probable
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
cause I've been out riding with my my
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
buddies doing charity runs and we've
 
01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
been stopped just because we were
 
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
wearing leather
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that is why I'm in support of this
 
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:24.890 align:start position:0%
and that is why I'm in support of this

welcome
 
01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman committee members
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Bill Murphy I live in
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
um just to give a little background I
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
moved from Massachusetts uh back in 1986
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I had ridden motorcycles up to that
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
point my first 10 years living in New
 
01:26:59.810 --> 01:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I was raising two boys so I
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
wasn't riding at the time
 
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
about 10 years in I bought a motorcycle
 
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
again and started riding and uh it
 
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
seemed at that point I was looked at
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
differently because of being on a
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
motorcycle wearing leather and so on
 
01:27:14.639 --> 01:27:15.169 align:start position:0%
motorcycle wearing leather and so on
um

01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
so there's been cases of of myself being
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
pulled over but I'd like to cite two
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
examples that seem to be the most
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
egregious to me just to put this in
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
context because curiously enough this
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
context applies to both examples
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a long time boxing trainer
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh for over 30 years I've been training
 
01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
boxes in the last 22 years I was a
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer trainer at National Police
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
Athletic League boxing gym
 
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
um my wife and I recently a few years
 
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
ago moved to Manchester we bought a
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
condominium so I looked for a gym
 
01:27:49.129 --> 01:27:49.139 align:start position:0%
locally and I knew of the Manchester
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
Police Athletic League gym
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
so I went there and spoke to the Head
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
trainer who welcomed me in said I'd be a
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
perfect fit we both knew each other from
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
boxing circles
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
um they have a strict application
 
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
process so he said you'd have to fill
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
out an application which I did
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
and submitted that
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
only to then and I have copies of the
 
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
return letter from the executive
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
director of the Manchester Powell
 
01:28:19.490 --> 01:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just read the reply from him
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
he's a solo bill I had the opportunity
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
to speak with both the past and
 
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
president mpal who wouldn't his message
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
to Powell
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
uh the Manchester Police Athletic
 
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department officers
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
assigned to the mpal full-time
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
while we certainly appreciate your
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
training experience and willingness to
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
provide character references membership
 
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
and a motorcycle club that could be
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
perceived as supportive of other clubs
 
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
with known or assumed connections to
 
01:28:47.090 --> 01:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
criminal activity remains a concern that
 
01:28:48.649 --> 01:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
prevents us from welcoming you as a
 
01:28:50.689 --> 01:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
trainer at mpal
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
our volunteers activities in and out of
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
the gym reflect on both mpal and the MPD
 
01:28:57.890 --> 01:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
and even the perception of affiliation
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
with an organization that that do not
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
share our values must be considered in
 
01:29:05.689 --> 01:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
our selection office process and then he
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
he wished me luck in finding a gym uh to
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
again volunteer at
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
so that's just a case of being a
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist and obviously being a
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
member of a motorcycle club where that
 
01:29:18.649 --> 01:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
alone was enough regardless of my
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
experience and the value that I could
 
01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:20.810 align:start position:0%
experience and the value that I could
add

01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
add
 
01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh working with kids in in an
 
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
underprivileged area
 
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
was enough to decline my application
 
01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:32.219 align:start position:0%
uh the other example is in 2019 I was
 
01:29:35.209 --> 01:29:35.219 align:start position:0%
leaving natural PAL boxing gym I was on
 
01:29:37.729 --> 01:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
my motorcycle I was wearing this vest
 
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
and as I turned off of Ash Street onto
 
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
West Hollis Street I was pulled over
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
it turns out it was the natural gang
 
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
task force
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
so the officer upfront acknowledged that
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
he had no reason to pull me over he said
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask you some questions
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
so I respectfully respectfully asked if
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
I could then leave given that there was
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
no reason to pull me over it and he
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
insisted that I say
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
so we went on to ask a few questions and
 
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
I I don't need to go and I don't think I
 
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
need to characterize his questions but
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
um there were some insinuations about my
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
membership in a motorcycle club
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh when I continued to respectfully
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
decline to answer he then finally said
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
okay you can you can be on your way
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
so that stop took about probably about
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
15-20 minutes or so
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
and again it was a national gang task
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
force who acknowledged up front we had
 
01:30:29.930 --> 01:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
no reason to pull you over we just
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask questions
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
um and then let me go
 
01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh so those are the two most egregious
 
01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
examples I can come up with there are
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
others but I have copies of the letter
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh the email response from mpal
 
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department League I
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
can hand those out to you folks
 
01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
um so if you have any questions
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and certainly please
 
01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:55.139 align:start position:0%
hand those forward any questions from
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
changing my plans here I know the
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
speaker is busy I actually have
 
01:31:09.169 --> 01:31:09.179 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Packard
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.090 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
committee

01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.290 align:start position:0%
committee
um

01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to come up and say oh
 
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
important I believe this bill is
 
01:31:29.930 --> 01:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
but before I go any further I want to
 
01:31:33.290 --> 01:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
say this is not a reflection on law
 
01:31:35.689 --> 01:31:35.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement in any shape a manner
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
I have the greatest respect for law
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement and all of you have seen a
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
letter I just put out supporting law
 
01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.610 align:start position:0%
letter I just put out supporting law
enforcement

01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
but this is a problem not as major in
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as it is in some of the
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
states but it's it's a problem that I
 
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
have personally been a victim of
 
01:31:59.290 --> 01:31:59.300 align:start position:0%
and let me quickly tell you my story
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh it was three or four of us riding out
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
in Route One a uh on the Beach Road in
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh Rye
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's not to get something to eat we're
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
heading back to 101 to head home
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
I got pulled over
 
01:32:16.729 --> 01:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
and I was pulled over by a riot police
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
officer and I said
 
01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
why did you pull me over they said you
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
passed a car in a double yellow line
 
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
well I think any of you that have been
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
on that road in the summertime know that
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
that's an impossibility
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
and I in fact did not pass a current
 
01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.450 --> 01:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
and I when I said I did not win any such
 
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:43.380 align:start position:0%
thing he said well you were writing on a
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
double yellow line
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
I said well
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
I might have touched it a few times but
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
I was not riding on a double yellow line
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
20 minutes later I was let go
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
why he decided to profile me and not the
 
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
other members other people I was with I
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
and it's irrelevant so it does happen
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to relay that story to
 
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
you that we do have a small problem in
 
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this bill just fixes
 
01:33:20.209 --> 01:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
that problem and I will hope that you
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
would all support it
 
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
um so that we can all make sure that
 
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
just because we're riding a motorcycle
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
we unprofiled
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of what kind of attire we
 
01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
happen to be wearing which most of the
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
time is jeans and
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
not in the summer but in fall or spring
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
a leather jacket so please give that to
 
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
careful consideration and hopefully we
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
can get any unanimous audit pass on a
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%

01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
the leather jackets leather vests the
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
clothes that we wear
 
01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
currently there are four states
 
01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:14.300 align:start position:0%
that have motorcycle legislating
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
anti-profiling motorcycle legislation
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
they are Idaho Louisiana Washington and
 
01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.430 align:start position:0%
they are Idaho Louisiana Washington and
Maryland

01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
Maryland
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out a couple of points
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
that I think are important back in 2011
 
01:36:31.129 --> 01:36:31.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire enacted HB 148 which
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited the acceptance of federal
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
funding from motorcycle only roadside
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
checkpoints here on the granite state
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
I'd like to quote what representative
 
01:36:45.850 --> 01:36:45.860 align:start position:0%
John tholl wrote in his February 11th
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
2011 house Transportation committee
 
01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:49.550 align:start position:0%
2011 house Transportation committee
report

01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
report
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
this bill states that no entity in the
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire accepts Federal
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
funding solely for the purpose of
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
setting up motorcycle only roadside
 
01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.350 align:start position:0%
setting up motorcycle only roadside
checkpoints

01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
checkpoints
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
this would be a clear example of
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
discrimination against one group of
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
citizens just because of what type of
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle they use for means of
 
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.290 align:start position:0%
vehicle they use for means of
transportation

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
so they recognize that we were being
 
01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
singled out because we ride motorcycles
 
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
in 2018 New Hampshire took the step one
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
step further
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
by enacting SB 516 which simply
 
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
prohibits any law enforcement officer or
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
agency from establishing or conducting
 
01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:31.739 align:start position:0%
motorcycle only checkpoints
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
and I'd like quoting from representative
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
Peter torosian's house Transportation
 
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
committee report of April 4th 2018.
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
this bill is to ensure that motorcycles
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
and their Riders are not singled out
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
unfairly from other motorists and forced
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
into roadside checkpoints for
 
01:37:51.649 --> 01:37:51.659 align:start position:0%
inspections when law enforcement does
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
not otherwise have probable cause for a
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
traffic stop
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
as you can see this legislative body
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
heard the concerns of New Hampshire
 
01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
motorcyclists both in 2011 and 2018.
 
01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:06.659 align:start position:0%
and they agreed
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
that this action would single us out
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
simply because
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
of what we rode
 
01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:14.870 align:start position:0%
of what we rode
motorcycles

01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
motorcycles
 
01:38:19.609 --> 01:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the U.S Senate resolution 154 a
 
01:38:21.649 --> 01:38:21.659 align:start position:0%
resolution promoting awareness of
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
motorcycle profiling and encouraging
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
collaboration and communication with the
 
01:38:30.729 --> 01:38:30.739 align:start position:0%
motorcycle community and law enforcement
 
01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:34.139 align:start position:0%
officials to prevent the instances of
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
profiling past humanist consent
 
01:38:40.609 --> 01:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
and then of course we had the pandemic
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
So currently in the U.S Congress session
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
the house resolution 366 promoting
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
awareness of motorcycle profiling
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
encouraging again collaboration
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
communication with the motorcycle
 
01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
community and law enforcement officials
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
to prevent instances of profiling has 78
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%

01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
we as a community are still being
 
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
discriminated against so be types the
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
types of clothes we wear the way that we
 
01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:08.810 align:start position:0%
types of clothes we wear the way that we
look

01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
look

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%

what they do not understand
 
01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I believe that motorcyclists are
 
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
very misunderstood
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that when several of us
 
01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:31.619 align:start position:0%
walked in here today
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
we were not looked at very well
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's not acceptable
 
01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
so I implore you please
 
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:43.139 align:start position:0%
pass HP 1000
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%

01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.010 align:start position:0%

I've had road bikes but I'd like to
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
introduce the idea that trail bikes are
 
01:41:50.689 --> 01:41:50.699 align:start position:0%
also motorcycles even though the state
 
01:41:53.689 --> 01:41:53.699 align:start position:0%
as far as trails are concerned sees them
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
as ohrvs two summers ago I was riding
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
with eight friends who had ATVs or utvs
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
the bigger units and two of us had
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
motorcycles as we approached the sheriff
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
the sheriff pulled out two of the
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
motorcycles me and another fellow and
 
01:42:15.169 --> 01:42:15.179 align:start position:0%
let the ATVs pass once stopped he asked
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
for oh HIV registration a license and or
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%

01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
check our exhaust
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
et cetera Etc he found nothing wrong why
 
01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
did he pull us over we were motorcycles
 
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
we were profiled thank you
 
01:42:36.590 --> 01:42:36.600 align:start position:0%

01:42:47.689 --> 01:42:47.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was just putting the pink

the emotion briefly Mr chairman uh Mr
chairman

01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I think all of us in the room uh
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
believe that discrimination is bad in
 
01:59:51.070 --> 01:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
it should never come down to the clothes
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
we wear
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
or are grooming
 
01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:00.830 align:start position:0%
or are grooming
or

02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
any reason other than perhaps how we're
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
operating a motor vehicle for whether we
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
are pulled over or stopped or questioned
 
02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons I would move up to
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:21.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:00:21.970 --> 02:00:21.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
02:00:28.129 --> 02:00:28.139 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Walsh um I would like
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
to agree with the representative that
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
any form of discrimination is a bad
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
thing and we
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
um and I can support this bill I look
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
forward to this the opportunity that
 
02:00:44.330 --> 02:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
this presents the legislature to further
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
Define other protected classes that may
 
02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
are not getting as much recognition for
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
the problem as they deserve and so I see
 
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
this as a good precedent to set and we
 
02:00:56.570 --> 02:00:56.580 align:start position:0%
can continue to look forward to
 
02:01:00.290 --> 02:01:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%

02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%

02:01:10.970 --> 02:01:10.980 align:start position:0%

02:01:21.530 --> 02:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
I will just add that the legislature has
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
seen fit in the past to deal with this
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of motorcycles both with
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
Federal funding and with the state law
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
just prohibiting the Discrimination that
 
02:01:33.410 --> 02:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
motorcycle only checkpoints in the past
 
02:01:35.689 --> 02:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
which demonstrates to me there is an
 
02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
issue here so I will be supporting this
 
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
as another layer of protection I
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%

actually before I do open up the public
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
hearing just a couple things I want to
 
04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
want to mention uh for anybody that's
 
04:04:09.229 --> 04:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
ever been to one of these hearings
 
04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
before uh in the anti-room we call it
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
out back if you'd like to sign in either
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
way on the bill for or against look for
 
04:04:19.969 --> 04:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
a blue sheet with 1424 on it if you do
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
wish to speak there are pink cards you
 
04:04:23.929 --> 04:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
need to fill those out and pass those
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
forward we do already have quite a
 
04:04:26.279 --> 04:04:27.889 align:start position:0%
forward we do already have quite a
collection

04:04:27.889 --> 04:04:27.899 align:start position:0%
collection
 
04:04:27.899 --> 04:04:29.450 align:start position:0%
collection
um

04:04:29.450 --> 04:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:31.490 --> 04:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
I guess that's all I need to say at this
 
04:04:33.849 --> 04:04:33.859 align:start position:0%
point I'll open up the public hearing on
 
04:04:37.610 --> 04:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
1424. I'm going to introduce the prime
 
04:04:40.729 --> 04:04:40.739 align:start position:0%
sponsor recognize the prime sponsor our
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative bordes and lastly because
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the volume of cards I am going to
 
04:04:49.370 --> 04:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
limit the testimony to three minutes a
 
04:04:49.380 --> 04:04:50.750 align:start position:0%
limit the testimony to three minutes a
piece

04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%

04:05:06.889 --> 04:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
I have some copies of my testimony and
 
04:05:08.090 --> 04:05:08.100 align:start position:0%
some facts
 
04:05:09.889 --> 04:05:09.899 align:start position:0%
um if you guys want copies or you want
 
04:05:20.570 --> 04:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the House

listening to House Bill 1424 relative to
 
04:05:30.050 --> 04:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
the speed limit on Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%

um

04:05:37.010 --> 04:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:39.110 --> 04:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
let's start with a brief history of Lake
 
04:05:40.969 --> 04:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee which is our largest
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
inland body of water in New Hampshire
 
04:05:46.250 --> 04:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
and how the speed limit got enacted in
 
04:05:50.330 --> 04:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
2005 House Bill 162 was introduced and
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
Pierce the house R and D committee that
 
04:05:56.330 --> 04:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
year from from 11 to 10 roll call vote
 
04:05:59.410 --> 04:05:59.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.410 --> 04:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
and Pierce the House vote was 185 to 153
 
04:06:06.050 --> 04:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
the Senate killed the bill by a 15-8
 
04:06:09.769 --> 04:06:09.779 align:start position:0%
roll call vote in 2008. in 2007 House
 
04:06:12.830 --> 04:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 847 was introduced The Spill
 
04:06:15.290 --> 04:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
started as a speed limit on all lakes
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
as it worked its way through the house
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
process it was amended to be a speed
 
04:06:24.170 --> 04:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
limit on Lake Winnipesaukee only now I
 
04:06:26.689 --> 04:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
must clarify Lake Winnipesaukee is the
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
only inland body of water in the entire
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire that has an RSA
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
dedicated to it
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
um that bill passed into law and also
 
04:06:39.769 --> 04:06:39.779 align:start position:0%
had a prospective repeal for 2011. a
 
04:06:41.330 --> 04:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
current Speaker of the House Sherman
 
04:06:43.250 --> 04:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
Packard for the minority and
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
transportation stated
 
04:06:47.689 --> 04:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
is this just another law that will
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
punish all responsible Boat Owners
 
04:06:51.469 --> 04:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
because of the irresponsible actions of
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
a very small percentage of Boat Owners
 
04:06:56.750 --> 04:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
do we really believe that by passing
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
this law that this small percentage of
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
inconsiderate and irresponsible people
 
04:07:03.290 --> 04:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
will change their habits
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
Allure is not going to make anybody
 
04:07:07.250 --> 04:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
change their habits
 
04:07:10.370 --> 04:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
in 2010 houseboat 464 was introduced to
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
repeal the repeal it Pierce and was
 
04:07:15.830 --> 04:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
signed into law rep John a hickle for
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
the minority of Transportation while the
 
04:07:19.969 --> 04:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
bill is well intended the minority
 
04:07:22.250 --> 04:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
believes that a two-year study will
 
04:07:24.170 --> 04:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
determine if speed causes an unsafe
 
04:07:26.450 --> 04:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
condition while the department of safety
 
04:07:28.550 --> 04:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
does not take a position on whether it
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
does what does not and there is no
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
statistics presented to the committee by
 
04:07:35.570 --> 04:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
either the bill sponsor or director of
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
safety the two-year study has only been
 
04:07:40.370 --> 04:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
allowed to have input on one year of
 
04:07:42.170 --> 04:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
questionable data and piercing this bill
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
is premature Based on data presented to
 
04:07:47.330 --> 04:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
the committee so they set up for a
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
two-year study
 
04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
and they only allow one year of it and
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
stop the study
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
in 2011 there was an effort to focus on
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
the speed limit on the broads only now
 
04:08:00.729 --> 04:08:00.739 align:start position:0%
the broads is basically the size of 14
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester airports
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's a big wide open body of water
 
04:08:09.410 --> 04:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's not overpopulated
 
04:08:12.649 --> 04:08:12.659 align:start position:0%
um it's just a great place for people to
 
04:08:14.990 --> 04:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
be able to open their throttles up and
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
move around
 
04:08:16.800 --> 04:08:17.450 align:start position:0%
move around
um

04:08:17.450 --> 04:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
the minority transportation
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
the minorities in support of this bill
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
because there is no evidence that
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
supports the notion that speed alone
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
affects safety
 
04:08:29.570 --> 04:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
now this is factual speed alone does not
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
affect safety
 
04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
alcohol is one of the major reasons for
 
04:08:37.090 --> 04:08:37.100 align:start position:0%
accidents within all bodies of water
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
we also haven't issue New Hampshire has
 
04:08:44.210 --> 04:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
a 150 foot rule which means if I'm
 
04:08:47.870 --> 04:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
operating my vessel I have to be 150
 
04:08:50.570 --> 04:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
feet away from the shoreline other boats
 
04:08:53.090 --> 04:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
other personal watercraft where the only
 
04:08:55.010 --> 04:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
state in the country I know that has a
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
150 foot rule on a safe passage rule
 
04:08:59.520 --> 04:09:01.090 align:start position:0%
150 foot rule on a safe passage rule
um

04:09:01.090 --> 04:09:01.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
so in regards to the um the broads only
 
04:09:07.490 --> 04:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
Bill the minority believes that the
 
04:09:10.010 --> 04:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Senate compromise is a fair
 
04:09:11.809 --> 04:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
one the increase in speed would only
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
affect the vast area known as the broads
 
04:09:16.610 --> 04:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
which is approximately 30 square miles
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
long or about the size of 14 Manchester
 
04:09:22.610 --> 04:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
airports this basically boils down to a
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
liberty issue as long as a voter follows
 
04:09:26.809 --> 04:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard rule six we believe that
 
04:09:28.370 --> 04:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
there should be
 
04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
they should be able to travel at a speed
 
04:09:34.189 --> 04:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
they believe is safe and courteous
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so let's talk about Coast Guard rule
 
04:09:38.110 --> 04:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
six which states every vessel shall have
 
04:09:40.729 --> 04:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
at all times proceed at a safe speed
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
that she can take proper and effective
 
04:09:43.260 --> 04:09:44.570 align:start position:0%
that she can take proper and effective
action

04:09:44.570 --> 04:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:09:46.729 --> 04:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
to avoid collision and be stopped within
 
04:09:48.530 --> 04:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
a distance appropriate to the prevailing
 
04:09:51.290 --> 04:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
circumstances and conditions in
 
04:09:53.330 --> 04:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
determining the safe speed the following
 
04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
factors shall be among those taken into
 
04:09:55.319 --> 04:09:57.349 align:start position:0%
factors shall be among those taken into
account

04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
and this is four vessels
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
the state of visibility
 
04:10:03.649 --> 04:10:03.659 align:start position:0%
the traffic density including
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
concentrations of fishing vessels and
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
other vessels so we have 150 foot rule
 
04:10:13.490 --> 04:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
so voters are supposed to be 150 feet
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
away from kayaks canoes and other motor
 
04:10:16.800 --> 04:10:17.929 align:start position:0%
away from kayaks canoes and other motor
vessels

04:10:17.929 --> 04:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
vessels
 
04:10:19.969 --> 04:10:19.979 align:start position:0%
but the Coast Guard has a little
 
04:10:22.429 --> 04:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
different view uh view on this the
 
04:10:24.410 --> 04:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
maneuverability of the vessel and
 
04:10:26.689 --> 04:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
special reference to stopping distance
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
and turning ability in the prevailing
 
04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
conditions at night the presence of
 
04:10:33.370 --> 04:10:33.380 align:start position:0%
background light such as form
 
04:10:37.849 --> 04:10:37.859 align:start position:0%
Shore lights or from back scatter or all
 
04:10:40.849 --> 04:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
nights the state of wind sea condition
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
and current and proximity of
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
navigational attitudes the drift and
 
04:10:48.530 --> 04:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
relations of our valuable death of water
 
04:10:50.809 --> 04:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
now remember in New Hampshire we have a
 
04:10:53.809 --> 04:10:53.819 align:start position:0%
150 foot rule which many other states do
 
04:10:56.570 --> 04:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
not have the 150-foot rule in New
 
04:10:59.149 --> 04:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire States you cannot operate a
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
vessel at greater than Headway speed so
 
04:11:04.250 --> 04:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
Headway speed is the fastest speed you
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
can go or not really the fastest but a
 
04:11:09.530 --> 04:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
speed you can go to maintain
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
drivability or maneuverability of the
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
vessel so I don't know if any of you
 
04:11:16.969 --> 04:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
guys have voted before but if you're
 
04:11:18.530 --> 04:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
going through a no wake zone you're
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
typically traveling at three to six
 
04:11:22.969 --> 04:11:22.979 align:start position:0%
miles an hour to maintain movability of
 
04:11:25.130 --> 04:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
that vessel
 
04:11:27.530 --> 04:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
um also in New Hampshire we have to be
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
150 feet away from swimmers other
 
04:11:33.050 --> 04:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
vessels rafts or floats permitted
 
04:11:35.809 --> 04:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
swimming areas dachshund Mooring fields
 
04:11:38.090 --> 04:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
and the shoreline
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
the 150 foot rule makes New Hampshire
 
04:11:42.170 --> 04:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
one of the safest boating states in the
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
entire New England area
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
there have been many false claims by
 
04:11:49.610 --> 04:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
opponents of this bill that fast boats
 
04:11:52.729 --> 04:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
create large waves this is factually and
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
scientifically wrong
 
04:11:57.530 --> 04:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
I provide you with a study proving the
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
statement wrong but to sum it up at
 
04:12:02.450 --> 04:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
higher speeds power boats level out
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
leaving a far less wake than transition
 
04:12:05.399 --> 04:12:06.410 align:start position:0%
leaving a far less wake than transition
speed

04:12:06.410 --> 04:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
speed
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
smaller planing boats will barely even
 
04:12:10.729 --> 04:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
kiss the water when they are going fast
 
04:12:14.269 --> 04:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
displacing a very very little water so
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
if you're driving your boat at let's
 
04:12:17.929 --> 04:12:17.939 align:start position:0%
just say 15 to 20 miles an hour you're
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to kick a huge wake back and you
 
04:12:22.910 --> 04:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
can see that as you throttle up and get
 
04:12:25.070 --> 04:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
on plane the week is going to dissipate
 
04:12:27.649 --> 04:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
and become smaller
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
let's talk about equal access to the
 
04:12:30.000 --> 04:12:31.910 align:start position:0%
let's talk about equal access to the
lake

04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
lake
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
first off of 135 Fish and Game boat
 
04:12:40.729 --> 04:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
ramps in the state 66 Alcoa top only so
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
a car top only ramp means only available
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
to kayakers canoes paddle boards I
 
04:12:49.130 --> 04:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
cannot take my boat and put it on top of
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
a car and use it now these vessels or
 
04:12:52.920 --> 04:12:53.809 align:start position:0%
a car and use it now these vessels or
these

04:12:53.809 --> 04:12:53.819 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:12:56.750 --> 04:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
paddle boards and canoes do not pay
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
registration fees they do not pay to
 
04:13:02.689 --> 04:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
access our body of water every single
 
04:13:05.210 --> 04:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
boat owner has to pay a registration fee
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
and additional fees in order to access
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
our Lakes so to me that is not equal
 
04:13:10.800 --> 04:13:13.030 align:start position:0%
our Lakes so to me that is not equal
access

04:13:13.030 --> 04:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
opponents of his bill keep saying that
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
high speed on a motor vessel is a safety
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
issue this has been proven wrong time
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
and time and time again
 
04:13:27.290 --> 04:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
speed has never been a safety issue on
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee I provided you with
 
04:13:31.010 --> 04:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
data from New Hampshire Marine Patrol
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
showing there has only been one speed
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
related accident in the past 10 years we
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if alcohol was a contributor
 
04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
to that accident
 
04:13:44.510 --> 04:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
but one accident a speed greater than 65
 
04:13:46.610 --> 04:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
miles an hour in 10 years
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
shows me that speed is not an issue and
 
04:13:51.889 --> 04:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
it was not an issue prior to this law
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
being enacted
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
safety was never the real reason for the
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
speed limit to begin with
 
04:14:01.250 --> 04:14:01.260 align:start position:0%
it was a group of homeowners that did
 
04:14:03.710 --> 04:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
not light speed boats
 
04:14:05.809 --> 04:14:05.819 align:start position:0%
they didn't like the noise they didn't
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
like their visual times have changed the
 
04:14:11.809 --> 04:14:11.819 align:start position:0%
majority of speed boats nowadays run
 
04:14:13.490 --> 04:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
outboard engines
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
their four-stroke engines you could
 
04:14:18.530 --> 04:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
barely hear them go by we also in the
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire have a noise
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance on motor vessels that's Marine
 
04:14:26.330 --> 04:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
Patrol strictly enforces
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
I've seen them out there all the time
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
with their decibel meter reading reading
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
the decibel levels of vessels so you
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
cannot vote
 
04:14:38.809 --> 04:14:38.819 align:start position:0%
with a Extremely Loud vessel on our
 
04:14:38.819 --> 04:14:40.729 align:start position:0%
with a Extremely Loud vessel on our

04:14:40.729 --> 04:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
includes in Winnipesaukee is the only
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
Lake in in New Hampshire with an RSA
 
04:14:48.290 --> 04:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
pertaining to speed the time has come to
 
04:14:50.030 --> 04:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
remove this burden that has impacted
 
04:14:52.370 --> 04:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
weekday tourism in The Lakes Region
 
04:14:55.610 --> 04:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
years ago I recall going to local
 
04:14:58.010 --> 04:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
restaurants bars and other waterfront
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
properties and not being able to find a
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
DOT slip I would have to wait 20 30 40
 
04:15:06.490 --> 04:15:06.500 align:start position:0%
minutes to be able to dock my boat
 
04:15:09.530 --> 04:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
nowadays during the weekdays I'm not the
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
weekends are there's more boats than
 
04:15:12.769 --> 04:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
ever on the lake there's more
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
registrations than ever but during the
 
04:15:18.309 --> 04:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
weekdays I could drive from Meredith Bay
 
04:15:21.950 --> 04:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
over to Alton Bay over to Wolfeboro and
 
04:15:28.189 --> 04:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:28.199 --> 04:15:29.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:15:29.389 --> 04:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:29.399 --> 04:15:31.130 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:15:31.130 --> 04:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:33.769 --> 04:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
in theory we are hurting our tourism
 
04:15:36.410 --> 04:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
industry in The Lakes Region during the
 
04:15:39.189 --> 04:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
week days
 
04:15:42.110 --> 04:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's an issue I mean our weekend
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
numbers are up the voter registrations
 
04:15:47.450 --> 04:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
are up but during the weekdays I've
 
04:15:51.050 --> 04:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
never seen the lake so empty
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
please vote order pass or order pass
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
with Amendment to the broads only which
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
is the biggest widest open body of water
 
04:16:03.769 --> 04:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
on Lake Winnipesaukee and in our state
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
other than obviously the ocean I'm
 
04:16:08.929 --> 04:16:08.939 align:start position:0%
talking about Inland bodies of water
 
04:16:11.570 --> 04:16:11.580 align:start position:0%
it is 30 square miles or about the size
 
04:16:14.689 --> 04:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
of 14 Manchester airports and I think
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
everybody and everybody on this
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee for your attention
 
04:16:23.149 --> 04:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
and considering misspelled thank you
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
04:16:28.130 --> 04:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%

04:17:52.370 --> 04:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
you said three minutes sir it would be
 
04:17:52.380 --> 04:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
you said three minutes sir it would be
great

04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
of the House Transportation committee my
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
name is representative John T McDonald
 
04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
I'm from Cal District Six which
 
04:18:06.590 --> 04:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
currently consists of the town of
 
04:18:06.600 --> 04:18:07.849 align:start position:0%
currently consists of the town of
Wolfgang

04:18:07.849 --> 04:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
Wolfgang
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to express
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
my opposition to house bill 1424.
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
before I start into the immediate of my
 
04:18:17.630 --> 04:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
presentation I want to clarify a couple
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
of things that my previous colleague
 
04:18:23.809 --> 04:18:23.819 align:start position:0%
uh stated there is a couple of other
 
04:18:26.090 --> 04:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
speed limits on this in the state of New
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in particular I would say 271
 
04:18:32.570 --> 04:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
colon 16 which is for Spofford Lake and
 
04:18:34.130 --> 04:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
that's 40 miles per hour during the
 
04:18:36.769 --> 04:18:36.779 align:start position:0%
daytime and 20 miles per hour at night
 
04:18:36.779 --> 04:18:37.610 align:start position:0%
daytime and 20 miles per hour at night
time

04:18:37.610 --> 04:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:18:40.490 --> 04:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
and also Squam Lake that speed limit is
 
04:18:43.849 --> 04:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
made by regulation and that's 40 days at
 
04:18:47.809 --> 04:18:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:49.790 --> 04:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
and you could also look at some of the
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds that have banned
 
04:18:55.969 --> 04:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
horsepower restrictions on their body as
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
that in itself kind of being a speed
 
04:19:00.170 --> 04:19:00.180 align:start position:0%
limit regulation
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
there are many different modes of
 
04:19:03.649 --> 04:19:03.659 align:start position:0%
transportation and or recreational
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles operated within our state
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
they include automobiles motorcycles
 
04:19:12.410 --> 04:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles ATVs and oh hivs
 
04:19:15.170 --> 04:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
the state has historically adopted laws
 
04:19:17.210 --> 04:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
and regulations to ensure the safe
 
04:19:19.250 --> 04:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
operation of those vehicles
 
04:19:21.649 --> 04:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
one of the most important laws is a
 
04:19:23.090 --> 04:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
speed in which those Vehicles may be
 
04:19:25.309 --> 04:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
safely operated on the highways and
 
04:19:25.319 --> 04:19:26.689 align:start position:0%
safely operated on the highways and
trails

04:19:26.689 --> 04:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
trails
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
now let's consider all boats and
 
04:19:30.410 --> 04:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
watercraft that operate on a several
 
04:19:31.969 --> 04:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
hundred bodies freshwater lakes and
 
04:19:34.490 --> 04:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
ponds our largest and most popular
 
04:19:37.010 --> 04:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
league for boating Associates is of
 
04:19:39.170 --> 04:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
course Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:19:40.729 --> 04:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
several years ago the New Hampshire
 
04:19:43.090 --> 04:19:43.100 align:start position:0%
legislature after taking testimony
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
adopted a speed limit on Winnipesaukee
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
of 30 miles per hour from half hour
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
after Sunset to a half hour before
 
04:19:52.429 --> 04:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
sunrise and 45 miles per hour at any
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
other time
 
04:19:57.050 --> 04:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
HB 1424 would remove this important
 
04:19:59.510 --> 04:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
comments and speed limit and we churned
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
us the problems that the original speed
 
04:20:03.649 --> 04:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
limit law was created to address
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
an important difference between boats
 
04:20:08.450 --> 04:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
and other models of transportation is
 
04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
that a boat does not have brakes
 
04:20:12.530 --> 04:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
if a boat operator must avoid a
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
collision the operator has no brakes to
 
04:20:16.729 --> 04:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
slow or stop the boat
 
04:20:18.590 --> 04:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
the options that the boat operator has
 
04:20:21.290 --> 04:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
are to identify the penny collision and
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
formulate the necessary race of action
 
04:20:25.849 --> 04:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
to take or at the best put the boat into
 
04:20:28.490 --> 04:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
the take the boat out of forward here
 
04:20:30.290 --> 04:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
but this action is not enough to stop
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
the ball from continuing in a forward
 
04:20:32.399 --> 04:20:34.130 align:start position:0%
the ball from continuing in a forward
motion

04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:20:37.490 --> 04:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
a boat traveling at 45 miles per hour is
 
04:20:39.490 --> 04:20:39.500 align:start position:0%
traveling at the rate of approximately
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
66 feet per second in perspective this
 
04:20:44.750 --> 04:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
boat would travel the length of football
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
field in 4.54 seconds
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
as the speed increases to 65 miles per
 
04:20:53.710 --> 04:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
hour the boat is traveling approximately
 
04:20:56.689 --> 04:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
95.3 feet per second and would cover the
 
04:20:58.370 --> 04:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
distance of a football field in
 
04:21:01.849 --> 04:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
approximately 3.147 seconds
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
operating a boat at night also has a
 
04:21:06.050 --> 04:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
challenges compared to daytime
 
04:21:06.060 --> 04:21:07.250 align:start position:0%
challenges compared to daytime
operations

04:21:07.250 --> 04:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
operations
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
folks do not have headlights power boats
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
display a red light on the port side or
 
04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
the left side of the boat and a green
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
light in the starboard or the right side
 
04:21:17.330 --> 04:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
of the boat
 
04:21:19.309 --> 04:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
those lights are required to be seen for
 
04:21:21.170 --> 04:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
a distance of one mile
 
04:21:22.849 --> 04:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
towards the student of the wheel of the
 
04:21:25.490 --> 04:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
boat it requires 360 degree light light
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
and that must be visible existence of
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
two miles
 
04:21:31.130 --> 04:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
on Lake Winnipesaukee there were no
 
04:21:33.649 --> 04:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
street lights glowing business lights or
 
04:21:35.330 --> 04:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
other source of Illumination commonly
 
04:21:38.450 --> 04:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
found on our roads at night a photo
 
04:21:40.250 --> 04:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
depends on the blinking white light of a
 
04:21:42.530 --> 04:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
state Place navigation of Bowie or any
 
04:21:44.689 --> 04:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
identified by light which is gained from
 
04:21:47.389 --> 04:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
the shoreline or the islands and in some
 
04:21:49.450 --> 04:21:49.460 align:start position:0%
cases the night the light from the Moon
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I hope that the committee
 
04:21:53.570 --> 04:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
members will continue with our state's
 
04:21:55.490 --> 04:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
efforts to providing a safe boating
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
experience for all the users of liquid
 
04:21:59.630 --> 04:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
visaki and maintain the current speed
 
04:21:59.640 --> 04:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
visaki and maintain the current speed
limit

04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:09.110 --> 04:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Christy Barton
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
you said two to five minutes I hope
 
04:22:14.450 --> 04:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
it's cut it down to like three possible
 
04:22:18.530 --> 04:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.450 --> 04:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and house
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation committee
 
04:22:23.809 --> 04:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
I am representative Christy Bartlett
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
representing Merrimack County District
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
19 East Concord
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify against this bill
 
04:22:31.969 --> 04:22:31.979 align:start position:0%
which would lift the daytime 45 mile an
 
04:22:34.370 --> 04:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
hour speed limit on Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this is madness
 
04:22:39.110 --> 04:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
we have a boat and we have a seasonal
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
home in Alton we've had a boat on the
 
04:22:44.090 --> 04:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
lake for the past 25 years and the
 
04:22:45.889 --> 04:22:45.899 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of boats on the
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
lake has risen tremendously over this
 
04:22:47.760 --> 04:22:48.950 align:start position:0%
lake has risen tremendously over this
time

04:22:48.950 --> 04:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not just talking about small boats
 
04:22:54.229 --> 04:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
either majority are power boats and they
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
are power more powerful and longer than
 
04:22:56.159 --> 04:22:57.349 align:start position:0%
are power more powerful and longer than
ever

04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
ever
 
04:22:59.929 --> 04:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
most responsible Boat Owners recognize
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
the need for speed limits due to the
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
number of inexperienced boat operators
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
and the sheer number of boats
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
particularly on weekends
 
04:23:11.330 --> 04:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
though there is a requirement for Boat
 
04:23:13.370 --> 04:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
Owners to take a one-time safety course
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
and most do take that course there's
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
little to no enforcement
 
04:23:21.469 --> 04:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
the few Marine Patrol officers are
 
04:23:23.630 --> 04:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
spread very thin over New Hampshire
 
04:23:25.610 --> 04:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
lakes and they have their hands full
 
04:23:27.710 --> 04:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
with enforcement and emergency calls on
 
04:23:29.450 --> 04:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
most days
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
add to this the many tourists we Welcome
 
04:23:34.849 --> 04:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
to our state who rent a boat during the
 
04:23:37.250 --> 04:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
vacation for just a few days
 
04:23:39.410 --> 04:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
they are not required to take the safety
 
04:23:42.590 --> 04:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
course but are issued a 14-day temporary
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
pass after reviewing the boat safety
 
04:23:45.359 --> 04:23:46.910 align:start position:0%
pass after reviewing the boat safety
manual

04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
manual
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
rental is a personal watercraft are also
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
very popular and these can hold up to
 
04:23:54.110 --> 04:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
four passengers and can make very quick
 
04:23:54.120 --> 04:23:55.429 align:start position:0%
four passengers and can make very quick
turns

04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
turns
 
04:23:57.290 --> 04:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
when there's an inexperienced operator
 
04:23:59.389 --> 04:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
this can be a real hazard out on the
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
water remember that boats have no brakes
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
for those of you who do not own a boat 4
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
5 miles an hour is very fast trust me
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
we never operate our boat over 35 miles
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
an hour and that's plenty fast enough
 
04:24:16.189 --> 04:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
the big cigarette boats can certainly be
 
04:24:18.769 --> 04:24:18.779 align:start position:0%
operated much faster but with a very
 
04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
long bow it's very difficult to see
 
04:24:22.849 --> 04:24:22.859 align:start position:0%
ahead and there are no stop lights on
 
04:24:24.290 --> 04:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
the water
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
how many voters know that the boat
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
coming from the right has the
 
04:24:27.239 --> 04:24:28.309 align:start position:0%
coming from the right has the
right-of-way

04:24:28.309 --> 04:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you how many times coming
 
04:24:32.450 --> 04:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
the boat's coming from the left never
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
even slow down as they approach our boat
 
04:24:38.210 --> 04:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
with the increase in tubers which have
 
04:24:40.490 --> 04:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
as many as four on them often these are
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
children just dropping off one without
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
notice could lead to a tragedy
 
04:24:47.210 --> 04:24:47.220 align:start position:0%
when a boater may not see someone in the
 
04:24:48.830 --> 04:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
water while traveling at a high rate of
 
04:24:48.840 --> 04:24:50.149 align:start position:0%
water while traveling at a high rate of
speed

04:24:50.149 --> 04:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
speed
 
04:24:52.130 --> 04:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
when the speed limits were enacted a few
 
04:24:54.530 --> 04:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
years ago the nighttime limit was a
 
04:24:56.809 --> 04:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
compromise at 30 miles an hour
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
pitch black out on the lake at night
 
04:25:01.490 --> 04:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
both of little red and green lights on
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
the bow and a white Stern Light that's
 
04:25:06.290 --> 04:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
it no headlights personally we would
 
04:25:08.149 --> 04:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
know never go faster than 15 miles an
 
04:25:09.229 --> 04:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
hour at night
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
perspective is completely different at
 
04:25:13.250 --> 04:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
night it's very difficult to determine
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
distance even of the shoreline
 
04:25:18.349 --> 04:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
in closing I would argue that boats that
 
04:25:20.570 --> 04:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
exceed 45 miles an hour belong on the
 
04:25:23.450 --> 04:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
ocean and not on Lake Winnipesaukee We
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
Love Our Lake and want to continue to
 
04:25:27.769 --> 04:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
enjoy it in relative safety and not fear
 
04:25:29.809 --> 04:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative any questions for the
 
04:25:32.880 --> 04:25:34.729 align:start position:0%
representative any questions for the
representative

04:25:34.729 --> 04:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:25:37.490 --> 04:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
breaking my neck here seeing none thank
 
04:25:37.500 --> 04:25:41.689 align:start position:0%
breaking my neck here seeing none thank
you

04:25:41.689 --> 04:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
Rob Bob Flanders Flanders perhaps
 
04:25:53.809 --> 04:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
Flannery oh yeah I see a little y there
 
04:25:56.750 --> 04:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
you put down 15 minutes I hope that it's
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:16.610 --> 04:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and committee
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
members thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
as a preface to what I'm about to say
 
04:26:29.450 --> 04:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm actually a waterfront property
 
04:26:32.689 --> 04:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
owner on Alton Bay and so I I have a
 
04:26:35.149 --> 04:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
good thing excuse me could you introduce
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
yourself did you we didn't hear your
 
04:26:40.370 --> 04:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
name officially Bob Flannery
 
04:26:43.450 --> 04:26:43.460 align:start position:0%
thank you who are you representing
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
myself and a group of other voters
 
04:26:49.689 --> 04:26:49.699 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
our group represents over 500 people who
 
04:26:54.649 --> 04:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
vote on Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
that does not even include our many
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
friends and family who of course also
 
04:27:00.590 --> 04:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
come along where we are responsible
 
04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
or the constant people who constantly
 
04:27:09.410 --> 04:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
complement our boats when parked at
 
04:27:11.330 --> 04:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
restaurants and public docks
 
04:27:13.250 --> 04:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
there was a tremendous outpouring of
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
support from so many people who don't
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
own a high performance boat but have
 
04:27:18.050 --> 04:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
seen us at the Docks and out on the
 
04:27:18.060 --> 04:27:19.790 align:start position:0%
seen us at the Docks and out on the
water

04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:27:21.710 --> 04:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
for over a decade we felt as if the
 
04:27:23.210 --> 04:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
speed limit has very much encroached
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
upon our right as safe responsible
 
04:27:25.199 --> 04:27:26.330 align:start position:0%
upon our right as safe responsible
boaters

04:27:26.330 --> 04:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
boaters
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
and our freedoms as New Hampshire
 
04:27:27.840 --> 04:27:29.809 align:start position:0%
and our freedoms as New Hampshire
citizens

04:27:29.809 --> 04:27:29.819 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
04:27:31.309 --> 04:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
this law never should have been passed
 
04:27:32.689 --> 04:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
in the first place and we hope that
 
04:27:35.870 --> 04:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1424 can right the wrongs
 
04:27:37.610 --> 04:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
that were made
 
04:27:39.290 --> 04:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
as a community
 
04:27:41.570 --> 04:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
safety on the water is Paramount concern
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
for us there's no group of people that
 
04:27:46.370 --> 04:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
are more knowledgeable or exhaustively
 
04:27:48.290 --> 04:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
thorough when it comes to Safety First
 
04:27:51.050 --> 04:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
approach to boating than people who own
 
04:27:54.410 --> 04:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
and operate performance boats
 
04:27:56.689 --> 04:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
it is great concern to operate safely
 
04:27:59.570 --> 04:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
and we as a community talk to each other
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
habitually about safe operations of our
 
04:28:02.040 --> 04:28:03.170 align:start position:0%
habitually about safe operations of our
boats

04:28:03.170 --> 04:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
boats
 
04:28:05.950 --> 04:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
speed itself is not a safety concern
 
04:28:08.689 --> 04:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
inexperience and intoxication are easily
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
the two factors that make boating unsafe
 
04:28:12.530 --> 04:28:12.540 align:start position:0%
on the lake
 
04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
a Marine Patrol supervisor has
 
04:28:17.450 --> 04:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
corroborated this two years ago in an
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
interview with Laconia newspaper with
 
04:28:22.370 --> 04:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
supporting statistics
 
04:28:24.050 --> 04:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk from the
 
04:28:26.090 --> 04:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
opposition in regards to erosion to
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
Shoreline as a result of fast boats
 
04:28:30.410 --> 04:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
giving off large wake
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
if any boat is traveling in excess of
 
04:28:34.610 --> 04:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
about 40 miles an hour there's little to
 
04:28:36.830 --> 04:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
no weight coming off of the boat
 
04:28:39.050 --> 04:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
to say that fast boats would cause any
 
04:28:41.210 --> 04:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
sort of increased erosion is absolutely
 
04:28:41.220 --> 04:28:42.889 align:start position:0%
sort of increased erosion is absolutely
false

04:28:42.889 --> 04:28:42.899 align:start position:0%
false
 
04:28:44.750 --> 04:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
if it were true many of us would not be
 
04:28:46.250 --> 04:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
driving these boats on the lake as
 
04:28:48.410 --> 04:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
shoreline erosion is a major concern for
 
04:28:50.689 --> 04:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
all of us who want property here or care
 
04:28:53.870 --> 04:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:55.550 --> 04:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
performance boats are constructed with
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
with as lightweight materials as
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
possible so they do not displace water
 
04:29:03.170 --> 04:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
and as a result do not create a large
 
04:29:05.809 --> 04:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
wake at any speed they are driven large
 
04:29:08.809 --> 04:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
Leisure boats travel at medium speed 20
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
to 35 miles an hour that create these
 
04:29:13.010 --> 04:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
damaging wakes
 
04:29:14.929 --> 04:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
and the talk of stirring up sediment of
 
04:29:16.729 --> 04:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
the bottom Lake as the boat drives over
 
04:29:19.309 --> 04:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
it is also completely false aside from
 
04:29:21.229 --> 04:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
shallow areas near shore where nobody
 
04:29:23.090 --> 04:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
will be driving any sort of speed anyway
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
there are laws in place clearly
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
befriending this along with General
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
many people who oppose laws of publicly
 
04:29:34.729 --> 04:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
stayed in various online forms their own
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
horror stories of out of control or
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise unsafe voters doing something
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
dangerous or concerning out on the water
 
04:29:43.010 --> 04:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
very often these stories contain
 
04:29:43.020 --> 04:29:44.929 align:start position:0%
very often these stories contain
something

04:29:44.929 --> 04:29:44.939 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:29:47.330 --> 04:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
about them going Full Throttle or going
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
too fast
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
we can say with great certainty that
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
these boats likely not even exceeding
 
04:29:56.030 --> 04:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
the 45 mile an hour speed limit
 
04:29:58.130 --> 04:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
am I getting close here can I just
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
summarize here quickly
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
summary the speed limit absolutely does
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
not affect Shoreline erosions on the
 
04:30:03.600 --> 04:30:04.429 align:start position:0%
not affect Shoreline erosions on the
lake

04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
lake
 
04:30:06.050 --> 04:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
the speed limit does not have any effect
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
in stirring up the bottom Lake
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
performance voters are generally the
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
safest most knowledgeable boat operators
 
04:30:15.050 --> 04:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol is state of that speed is
 
04:30:16.490 --> 04:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
not a primary safety concern
 
04:30:19.090 --> 04:30:19.100 align:start position:0%
inexperienced intoxication are
 
04:30:23.929 --> 04:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
noise concerns are unfounded as the
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
noise regulations will stay the same of
 
04:30:29.929 --> 04:30:29.939 align:start position:0%
Bill 1424 passes
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 1424 passing will have zero
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
consequences for paddlers out on the
 
04:30:34.439 --> 04:30:35.689 align:start position:0%
consequences for paddlers out on the
lake

04:30:35.689 --> 04:30:35.699 align:start position:0%
lake
 
04:30:37.490 --> 04:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee has a rich history of
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
performance voting and provides a very
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
safe and reasonable environment to
 
04:30:42.530 --> 04:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
safely drive and increase speed usage
 
04:30:44.570 --> 04:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
sir I think it's time okay
 
04:30:47.330 --> 04:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
Okay so we've given you oh thank you
 
04:30:49.849 --> 04:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for your for your
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you any questions
 
04:30:51.359 --> 04:30:54.950 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you any questions
for

04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.010 --> 04:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
okay before we go on let me explain
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the construction
 
04:31:02.760 --> 04:31:04.550 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the construction
paper

04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
paper
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
the yellow construction paper when
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative Thompson puts it up means
 
04:31:11.210 --> 04:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
you have about 30 seconds left
 
04:31:13.969 --> 04:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
when he puts up the red one we ask you
 
04:31:15.410 --> 04:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
to just
 
04:31:19.130 --> 04:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
summarize and within 10-15 seconds and
 
04:31:21.170 --> 04:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
get done with it I've got about another
 
04:31:23.210 --> 04:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
40 cards or so maybe 50. and I want
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
everybody to have a chance to be heard
 
04:31:31.729 --> 04:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm doing what I'm doing so
 
04:31:34.370 --> 04:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
if that offends someone then I apologize
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
but I apologize but I'm not sorry
 
04:31:39.170 --> 04:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
because I want everybody to be hurt
 
04:31:46.370 --> 04:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:49.250 --> 04:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
Harry Vogel
 
04:31:51.170 --> 04:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
now you said four minutes I would love
 
04:31:54.110 --> 04:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
three minutes thank you and I do have
 
04:31:54.120 --> 04:31:55.250 align:start position:0%
three minutes thank you and I do have
testimony

04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:31:55.260 --> 04:32:04.849 align:start position:0%
testimony
um

04:32:04.849 --> 04:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.170 --> 04:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:08.330 --> 04:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and the
 
04:32:10.969 --> 04:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:32:12.769 --> 04:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
my name is Harry Vogel I am the senior
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
biologist and executive director of The
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
Loon preservation committee I also sit
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
on the Environmental Policy Committee of
 
04:32:20.510 --> 04:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Audubon and I am
 
04:32:22.370 --> 04:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
representing that organization as well
 
04:32:24.050 --> 04:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
preservation Committee in New Hampshire
 
04:32:28.729 --> 04:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
Audubon oppose House Bill 1424 for two
 
04:32:31.070 --> 04:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
reasons the first reason is concerns
 
04:32:32.929 --> 04:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
about our loon population
 
04:32:35.090 --> 04:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
loons are a state-retten species in New
 
04:32:37.490 --> 04:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lpc's intensive management has
 
04:32:39.290 --> 04:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
more than tripled our population of
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
lands in New Hampshire since we began
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
our work in 1975 but our loans face some
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
big challenges including the challenge
 
04:32:49.370 --> 04:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
of fast-moving boats and personal
 
04:32:49.380 --> 04:32:50.929 align:start position:0%
of fast-moving boats and personal
watercraft

04:32:50.929 --> 04:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
watercraft
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
collisions with boats and personal
 
04:32:55.610 --> 04:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
watercraft account for 13.8 percent of
 
04:32:57.530 --> 04:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
known causes of adult living deaths on
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee that is eight times the
 
04:33:02.870 --> 04:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
percentage of other lakes in the state
 
04:33:05.090 --> 04:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
mortalities from boat collisions also
 
04:33:07.129 --> 04:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
affect loon nesting success because once
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
you lose a member of a loon pair it can
 
04:33:11.929 --> 04:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
be years before elune finds a new mate
 
04:33:14.449 --> 04:33:14.459 align:start position:0%
and begins to be productive again
 
04:33:16.369 --> 04:33:16.379 align:start position:0%
both collisions also affect the survival
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
of loon chicks young loons are small and
 
04:33:22.010 --> 04:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
dark they are not easily seen by voters
 
04:33:23.990 --> 04:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
and they're too buoyant to dive away
 
04:33:25.730 --> 04:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
from a fast-moving boat
 
04:33:27.529 --> 04:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
those fast-moving boats are very common
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
on Lake Winnipesaukee and loons on
 
04:33:31.670 --> 04:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee have seen larger declines
 
04:33:33.890 --> 04:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
in their population and breeding success
 
04:33:36.170 --> 04:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
than in other areas of the state
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
balloon population on Winnipesaukee is
 
04:33:40.609 --> 04:33:40.619 align:start position:0%
declined from an historical level of 40
 
04:33:43.609 --> 04:33:43.619 align:start position:0%
or more pairs to an average of 28 pairs
 
04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
collisions with boats and personal
 
04:33:49.010 --> 04:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
watercraft are one of the largest known
 
04:33:50.929 --> 04:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
causes of loon chick mortality on
 
04:33:50.939 --> 04:33:52.310 align:start position:0%
causes of loon chick mortality on
Winnipesaukee

04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee
 
04:33:55.010 --> 04:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
fewer than 7 out of 10 loons hatched on
 
04:33:57.051 --> 04:33:57.061 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee survived to Fletch that's
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
10 below the Statewide average
 
04:34:01.609 --> 04:34:01.619 align:start position:0%
loons on Winnipesaukee have fledged
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
fewer than 0.4 chicks per pair per year
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that is 19 below the Statewide
 
04:34:07.920 --> 04:34:08.869 align:start position:0%
and that is 19 below the Statewide
average

04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
average
 
04:34:12.051 --> 04:34:12.061 align:start position:0%
so Winnipesaukee holds 44 000 Acres of
 
04:34:14.029 --> 04:34:14.039 align:start position:0%
water but last year it held just six
 
04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
surviving Loom chicks that breeding
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
success is not enough to maintain a
 
04:34:21.709 --> 04:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
viable population of loons on the lake
 
04:34:23.449 --> 04:34:23.459 align:start position:0%
the second reason that Moon preservation
 
04:34:24.590 --> 04:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
Committee in New Hampshire Audubon
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
opposed this bill is concerns about our
 
04:34:29.330 --> 04:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
biologists and volunteers on the lake
 
04:34:32.330 --> 04:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
this summer LPC will have 10 biologists
 
04:34:34.010 --> 04:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire's Lakes working for the
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
public good and to protect a socially
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
and economically important Wildlife
 
04:34:37.920 --> 04:34:39.051 align:start position:0%
and economically important Wildlife
species

04:34:39.051 --> 04:34:39.061 align:start position:0%
species
 
04:34:40.670 --> 04:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
some of those biologists will be on Lake
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee and they will spend more
 
04:34:44.929 --> 04:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
than 400 hours on the lake in a small
 
04:34:47.570 --> 04:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
Boston Whaler our boats have a top speed
 
04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
of about 35 miles an hour but they will
 
04:34:51.470 --> 04:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
be able to cover the entire Lake very
 
04:34:51.480 --> 04:34:52.250 align:start position:0%
be able to cover the entire Lake very
well

04:34:52.250 --> 04:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:34:54.529 --> 04:34:54.539 align:start position:0%
over the years as we have seen more and
 
04:34:56.810 --> 04:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
faster votes on Winnipesaukee I have had
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
increasing concerns about the safety of
 
04:35:00.650 --> 04:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
our field biologists and our volunteers
 
04:35:01.970 --> 04:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
on the lake
 
04:35:03.289 --> 04:35:03.299 align:start position:0%
and speed limits have helped to
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of those concerns
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
and the last point that I would like to
 
04:35:09.051 --> 04:35:09.061 align:start position:0%
make is that loons are the tip of the
 
04:35:11.090 --> 04:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
iceberg the same issues that affect
 
04:35:13.551 --> 04:35:13.561 align:start position:0%
loans affect mergansers and mallards and
 
04:35:15.529 --> 04:35:15.539 align:start position:0%
otters and other wildlife
 
04:35:18.109 --> 04:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
loons and our other Lake Wildlife bring
 
04:35:20.090 --> 04:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
residents and visitors to our state they
 
04:35:22.129 --> 04:35:22.139 align:start position:0%
contribute to our economy and to the
 
04:35:23.689 --> 04:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
spirit that makes our Lakes special to
 
04:35:25.490 --> 04:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's residents and visitors
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
it would be a shame to lose the very
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
qualities that have attracted both loons
 
04:35:32.269 --> 04:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
and people to our Lakes so the Loon
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
preservation committee and New Hampshire
 
04:35:35.810 --> 04:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
Audubon support limiting excessive speed
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
on our lakes and so we oppose house bill
 
04:35:38.520 --> 04:35:40.129 align:start position:0%
on our lakes and so we oppose house bill
1424.

04:35:40.129 --> 04:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
1424.
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
that is the end of my testimony I'd be
 
04:35:43.730 --> 04:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions any questions
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:35:45.840 --> 04:35:47.990 align:start position:0%
for the
Witness

04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
my neck will be broken before the day's
 
04:35:59.510 --> 04:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:01.730 --> 04:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
next up is Bob
 
04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
is total or stroller
 
04:36:07.609 --> 04:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
you said 1pm I don't know what that
 
04:36:07.619 --> 04:36:08.510 align:start position:0%
you said 1pm I don't know what that
means

04:36:08.510 --> 04:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
means
 
04:36:10.849 --> 04:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
so it'll be three minutes right sir
 
04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.170 --> 04:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Bob strodel I am a long
 
04:36:23.330 --> 04:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
time New Hampshire resident I'm also a
 
04:36:25.629 --> 04:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
camp director and this will be my
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
49th year Camp I've seen a lot of
 
04:36:30.051 --> 04:36:30.061 align:start position:0%
changes on the lake and when I first
 
04:36:32.209 --> 04:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
heard that this bill was coming out for
 
04:36:34.609 --> 04:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
consideration I thought somebody was
 
04:36:36.890 --> 04:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
kidding me I just thought intuitively
 
04:36:39.170 --> 04:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
that boats traveling around the lake at
 
04:36:41.209 --> 04:36:41.219 align:start position:0%
45 miles an hour were going to be a lot
 
04:36:43.490 --> 04:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
safer and are a lot safer than 65 miles
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
I love boats I've got nothing against
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
boats in fact probably everybody here in
 
04:36:51.529 --> 04:36:51.539 align:start position:0%
the room I probably got more boats
 
04:36:53.150 --> 04:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
registered in mining than everybody else
 
04:36:56.090 --> 04:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
here we've got five power boats we've
 
04:36:56.100 --> 04:36:56.869 align:start position:0%
here we've got five power boats we've
got

04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:36:59.689 --> 04:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
another 15 sailboats that are over 12
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
feet long and we've probably got two
 
04:37:04.910 --> 04:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
dozen smaller boats so I'm here just to
 
04:37:06.529 --> 04:37:06.539 align:start position:0%
say to represent the kids that are
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire there's 180
 
04:37:10.609 --> 04:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
camps in the in New Hampshire my kids
 
04:37:11.929 --> 04:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
I've got over a thousand kids that come
 
04:37:13.490 --> 04:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
to Camp every year in Lakeland sake
 
04:37:16.010 --> 04:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
please take a look at the first sheet on
 
04:37:18.170 --> 04:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
this documentation here this shows you
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
where our camps are located Camp
 
04:37:22.129 --> 04:37:22.139 align:start position:0%
brookwood's a camp Deer Run in Alton and
 
04:37:24.170 --> 04:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
we also own Plum Island which by the way
 
04:37:26.449 --> 04:37:26.459 align:start position:0%
is a loon Reserve too
 
04:37:28.970 --> 04:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
we have been able we've had to stop some
 
04:37:30.349 --> 04:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
of our things in the past for going
 
04:37:32.330 --> 04:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
using Plum Island music kids out there
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
canoeing and you can see Robert's Cove
 
04:37:36.650 --> 04:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
Marina on the right hand side the boats
 
04:37:38.209 --> 04:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
get their gas out of rubber Scope Arena
 
04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
Thunder about out into the bay there
 
04:37:41.929 --> 04:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
into the broad area and so we have to be
 
04:37:43.970 --> 04:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
very very careful when we use Palm
 
04:37:46.490 --> 04:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
Island and that's just one example I'd
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
like to just copy give you of why we
 
04:37:50.929 --> 04:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
want slower boats on the lake we love
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
boats we just want to slow our boats and
 
04:37:54.349 --> 04:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
like to protect our kids and protect
 
04:37:56.090 --> 04:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
people coming in from the outside of the
 
04:37:57.529 --> 04:37:57.539 align:start position:0%
states thank you for listening and thank
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
you for the work you do for representing
 
04:38:00.289 --> 04:38:00.299 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
04:38:03.051 --> 04:38:03.061 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
04:38:03.061 --> 04:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
questions

04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:25.849 --> 04:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:28.129 --> 04:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
you've got five minutes on your card but
 
04:38:30.051 --> 04:38:30.061 align:start position:0%
I hope you can cut it down to three
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.650 --> 04:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
my name is Abigail Adams and I'm a
 
04:38:44.689 --> 04:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
resident of Wolfeboro
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I voted in Lake Winnipesaukee for
 
04:38:49.010 --> 04:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
about 40 years
 
04:38:50.689 --> 04:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
I thank you for allowing me to speak
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
the U.S Coast Guard has released its
 
04:39:00.170 --> 04:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
2020 recreational boating statistics
 
04:39:03.650 --> 04:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
report revealing that there were 767
 
04:39:07.490 --> 04:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
voting fatalities Nationwide in 2020 as
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
it's a 25 increase from 2019.
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
from 2019 to 2020 the number of the
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
total number of accidents increased 26
 
04:39:18.480 --> 04:39:20.029 align:start position:0%
total number of accidents increased 26
percent

04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
there is evidence that the voting
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
activity has increased significantly
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic from reports of
 
04:39:28.730 --> 04:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
increased boat sales insurance policies
 
04:39:31.609 --> 04:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
insurance claims and calls for towing
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
and with increased exposure that is more
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
boating hours there were greater risks
 
04:39:40.090 --> 04:39:40.100 align:start position:0%
of death injuries and accidents
 
04:39:42.590 --> 04:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
interestingly this report lists the
 
04:39:44.570 --> 04:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
primary contributing factors in
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
accidents in 2020 as operator in
 
04:39:50.930 --> 04:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
attention inexperience
 
04:39:54.770 --> 04:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
in proper Lookout and speed
 
04:39:57.770 --> 04:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
alcohol use comes in sixth
 
04:39:59.810 --> 04:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
the Marine Patrol has stated that
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol is a major issue in both
 
04:40:04.910 --> 04:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
involving voter safety
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
this is at odds with the U.S Coast Guard
 
04:40:09.650 --> 04:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
data and yes we know voting while
 
04:40:11.448 --> 04:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
intoxicated has been a problem on
 
04:40:14.090 --> 04:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee but a boat speeding along
 
04:40:16.850 --> 04:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
at 65 miles an hour with an impaired
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
driver is far more likely to cause an
 
04:40:19.440 --> 04:40:20.690 align:start position:0%
driver is far more likely to cause an
accident

04:40:20.690 --> 04:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
accident
 
04:40:23.810 --> 04:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
than one that is obeying the speed limit
 
04:40:26.030 --> 04:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
and clearly a family boater trying to
 
04:40:27.890 --> 04:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
get out of the way and of what a
 
04:40:29.090 --> 04:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
collision is going to have a better
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
chance of avoiding an accident if the
 
04:40:33.650 --> 04:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
boat is traveling at 45 miles an hour or
 
04:40:33.660 --> 04:40:35.090 align:start position:0%
boat is traveling at 45 miles an hour or
less

04:40:35.090 --> 04:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:40:37.970 --> 04:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
the existing speed limit is working with
 
04:40:41.570 --> 04:40:41.580 align:start position:0%
few speed related accidents since it was
 
04:40:43.550 --> 04:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
put in to law
 
04:40:46.128 --> 04:40:46.138 align:start position:0%
one accident does stand out and occurred
 
04:40:49.850 --> 04:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
in 2015 when a swimmer accompanied by a
 
04:40:49.860 --> 04:40:51.050 align:start position:0%
in 2015 when a swimmer accompanied by a
kayaker

04:40:51.050 --> 04:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
kayaker
 
04:40:53.628 --> 04:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
on Winnipesaukee was hit by a boat going
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
65 miles an hour plus according to the
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol report and boats traveling
 
04:41:02.810 --> 04:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
at that speed simply do not have enough
 
04:41:05.090 --> 04:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
time to see and react to other boaters
 
04:41:07.250 --> 04:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
or swimmers and I've attached that
 
04:41:08.868 --> 04:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
report for you
 
04:41:11.150 --> 04:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
we need to keep in mind that the number
 
04:41:13.070 --> 04:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
of people obtaining their boat license
 
04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire has increased from 6500
 
04:41:20.208 --> 04:41:20.218 align:start position:0%
in 2019 to over 30
 
04:41:23.990 --> 04:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
000 in 2020. this represents an almost
 
04:41:26.810 --> 04:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
500 percent increase in new and
 
04:41:29.810 --> 04:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
inexperienced Motors on our legs
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
increasing speeds even if Justin the
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
broads is unsafe
 
04:41:36.530 --> 04:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
given the sharp increase in boat
 
04:41:38.570 --> 04:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
registrations and the significant
 
04:41:40.190 --> 04:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
understaffing of the New Hampshire
 
04:41:42.530 --> 04:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
04:41:44.570 --> 04:41:44.580 align:start position:0%
and let's never forget that one of the
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
most high-profile fatal accidents
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
happened on the broads in 2008. when a
 
04:41:52.610 --> 04:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
performance boat crashed into diamond
 
04:41:52.620 --> 04:41:53.868 align:start position:0%
performance boat crashed into diamond
island

04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
island
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
the broads is the Hub of the lake
 
04:41:57.840 --> 04:41:59.208 align:start position:0%
the broads is the Hub of the lake
and

04:41:59.208 --> 04:41:59.218 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:01.250 --> 04:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
people must pass from one port to
 
04:42:03.288 --> 04:42:03.298 align:start position:0%
another Sailors Anglers and family
 
04:42:06.050 --> 04:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
boaters use the broads
 
04:42:08.510 --> 04:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
some family voters pull up anchor and
 
04:42:10.970 --> 04:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
drift in the broads and where do you
 
04:42:12.890 --> 04:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
define where the brides begin and end
 
04:42:15.410 --> 04:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
are you going to put up a million
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
unsightly buoys to Define what deems
 
04:42:21.948 --> 04:42:21.958 align:start position:0%
what you deem to be the periphery of the
 
04:42:24.410 --> 04:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
broads and who pays for these buoys
 
04:42:26.570 --> 04:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
finally I would just like to finish by
 
04:42:27.948 --> 04:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
saying that I'm a member of the
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%

Association in New Hampshire lakes and
 
04:42:35.690 --> 04:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
you should be aware that both of those
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
organizations oppose
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
bill number
 
04:42:43.490 --> 04:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
1424 and we urge you to vote itl thank

next we have
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:04.730 --> 04:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
three minutes is right on the money
 
04:43:06.890 --> 04:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry the three minutes is right on

Flores I'm uh the happy husband of Mona

Perrault I'm on peralt sat in 418 the

to do and again asking a favor of you is
 
04:43:26.810 --> 04:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
pretty bold
 
04:43:29.448 --> 04:43:29.458 align:start position:0%
please go home to your family and tell
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
them thank you because as a family

member supporting you I want you to
 
04:43:36.350 --> 04:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
somebody testified today and wanted to
 
04:43:37.970 --> 04:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank your families and loved ones and
 
04:43:40.970 --> 04:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
that's me I wanted to uh come to you
 
04:43:43.448 --> 04:43:43.458 align:start position:0%
today I'm actually in favor of the bill
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things I've been an
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity I currently own eight boats
 
04:43:50.570 --> 04:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh the one that doesn't need any safety
 
04:43:51.770 --> 04:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
certificate doesn't need any
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
registration is one that you paddle
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's the one that I have to actually
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
educate my guests who will be using that
 
04:44:00.350 --> 04:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
boat wow we just had testimony now that
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
they have uh more safety certificates
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
being issued you want to jump up and
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
down and say thank you because that's
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
exactly the reason why we have a safe
 
04:44:11.810 --> 04:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire we have a 150
 
04:44:13.250 --> 04:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
foot rule and I want to tell you now see
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
what that gentleman is standing he's a
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
sergeant and arms works for them that me
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
into all the way over here to this end
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
is not is actually less than 150 feet so
 
04:44:24.590 --> 04:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
between that wall and that wall if you
 
04:44:26.270 --> 04:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
come anywhere near another boat you have
 
04:44:28.610 --> 04:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
to be at headways speed what happens is
 
04:44:30.890 --> 04:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
when you're building in a large area of
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
water you're actually observing you have
 
04:44:34.970 --> 04:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
who has the right of way and then you're
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually to reduce the speed that is the
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
reason that we have never had to have a
 
04:44:41.810 --> 04:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
speed limit on the lake now we actually
 
04:44:44.448 --> 04:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
had testimony of having a fatality on
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
the lake in 2008 that was not a speeding
 
04:44:47.040 --> 04:44:47.868 align:start position:0%
the lake in 2008 that was not a speeding
boat

04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
boat
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
you understand that you're gonna you
 
04:44:52.930 --> 04:44:52.940 align:start position:0%
have safety issues we have no more
 
04:44:56.208 --> 04:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
or less safety issues and before we had
 
04:44:58.250 --> 04:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
a speed limit what I'm sharing with you
 
04:45:00.650 --> 04:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
is this that what we have is education
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
that is the reason in New Hampshire that
 
04:45:05.090 --> 04:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
we have success we have success because
 
04:45:08.030 --> 04:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
we implemented a safety certificate I
 
04:45:10.970 --> 04:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
have mine right here okay and then I
 
04:45:12.410 --> 04:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
share this with you
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
is that that I vote in other parts of
 
04:45:16.910 --> 04:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
the country and I'm going to tell you
 
04:45:19.250 --> 04:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
this at 25 miles an hour and a boat
 
04:45:21.288 --> 04:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
coming within three feet of you or four
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
feet or five feet or ten feet is not
 
04:45:26.510 --> 04:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
safe I bought a name I vote in New York
 
04:45:29.930 --> 04:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
I vote in uh in Tennessee and quite
 
04:45:31.970 --> 04:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
frankly what we have is something very
 
04:45:34.190 --> 04:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
unique but what we have as an
 
04:45:36.650 --> 04:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity as Representatives here is
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
to take a bill that was not necessary
 
04:45:41.448 --> 04:45:41.458 align:start position:0%
you understand for 17 different times it
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
came to the transportation committee and
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee decided
 
04:45:47.208 --> 04:45:47.218 align:start position:0%
they didn't need it okay what they did
 
04:45:48.830 --> 04:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
was they gave it the house Recreation
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
and resource they did a bunch of studies
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
and that is the reason we have a speed
 
04:45:53.930 --> 04:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
limit today because they didn't put it
 
04:45:55.070 --> 04:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
to the professional people who
 
04:45:58.730 --> 04:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
understand if you give a education Bill
 
04:46:01.128 --> 04:46:01.138 align:start position:0%
to the fishing game the people who sit
 
04:46:02.448 --> 04:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
on the fish and game will do the very
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
best that they can and I love them for
 
04:46:06.650 --> 04:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
that because my wife did that when if
 
04:46:07.970 --> 04:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
you don't have all the information you
 
04:46:09.890 --> 04:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
get it but what happened was it was
 
04:46:11.448 --> 04:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
passed in the committee that didn't have
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
it we do not need it and to this day
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to get a bill
 
04:46:18.770 --> 04:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
that is not necessary it has never been
 
04:46:18.780 --> 04:46:19.850 align:start position:0%
that is not necessary it has never been
necessary

04:46:19.850 --> 04:46:19.860 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:46:21.708 --> 04:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
um thank you and I'll take any questions
 
04:46:25.850 --> 04:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
you might have thank you any questions
 
04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:42.110 --> 04:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
you said five minutes ma'am I hope you
 
04:47:06.050 --> 04:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.208 --> 04:47:08.218 align:start position:0%
honorable chair and how's Transportation
 
04:47:10.970 --> 04:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:47:13.250 --> 04:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
according to the American Red Cross and
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
materials produced by the U.S Coast
 
04:47:17.810 --> 04:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
Guard visibility is impaired by
 
04:47:20.208 --> 04:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
reflections of light on water and a heat
 
04:47:22.910 --> 04:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
wind wave action motor vibration and
 
04:47:25.010 --> 04:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
noise creates a phenomenon called
 
04:47:28.250 --> 04:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
boating fatigue boaters may be in less

than Peak physical condition
 
04:47:32.810 --> 04:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
the longer a boat operators Excursion
 
04:47:36.050 --> 04:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
the less alert he or she is most boat
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%

annually operating their boat leaving
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
them Rusty at the throttle and the
 
04:47:45.708 --> 04:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
former Marine Patrol director
 
04:47:48.050 --> 04:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
stated that this number is actually 35
 
04:47:51.050 --> 04:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
hours for New England voters people on
 
04:47:52.970 --> 04:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
boats do not wear seat belts are not
 
04:47:55.010 --> 04:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
usually fully contained in their boat or
 
04:47:56.750 --> 04:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
wearing life jackets in other words
 
04:47:59.330 --> 04:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
they're unprepared for the unexpected
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
according to the Canadian safe voting
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
data the effects of alcohol can be
 
04:48:06.530 --> 04:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
tripled by voter fatigue
 
04:48:08.510 --> 04:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard training materials show that
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
in a collision a 20 a 20 mile per hour
 
04:48:13.850 --> 04:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
boat becomes airborne
 
04:48:16.670 --> 04:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
and then as the speed doubles the force
 
04:48:18.910 --> 04:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
of impact quadruples
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement authorities at lakes around
 
04:48:23.208 --> 04:48:23.218 align:start position:0%
the country where there are speed limits
 
04:48:25.970 --> 04:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
emphatically state that 95 to 98 percent
 
04:48:28.850 --> 04:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
of Voters abide by limits just by having
 
04:48:30.890 --> 04:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
them on the books and this is what we've
 
04:48:33.410 --> 04:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
seen on the big lake over the past 13
 
04:48:36.770 --> 04:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
years these enforcement authorities also
 
04:48:38.930 --> 04:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
state that boating speed limits enable
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
them to enforce all voting laws more
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
effectively and that speed limit
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
regulation is critical to manage a
 
04:48:50.690 --> 04:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
growing congested Waters and to maintain
 
04:48:53.690 --> 04:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
the state's recreational values
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
as one enforcement person said speed is
 
04:48:58.550 --> 04:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
an issue speed limits improve Reaction
 
04:49:01.128 --> 04:49:01.138 align:start position:0%
Time cutting down on accidents and
 
04:49:03.410 --> 04:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
injury boats have not changed in 40

higher limits anywhere including the
 
04:50:18.170 --> 04:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
broads would invite fast voters to

04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%

04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
you said six minutes sir I would

04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:51:28.610 --> 04:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
I will try to chop my six minute
 
04:51:31.550 --> 04:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
presentation down to three my name is Al
 
04:51:34.730 --> 04:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
poznick I live in Alton Bay I've been
 
04:51:37.250 --> 04:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
here since 1965 and during that period
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
there have been huge changes on the lake
 
04:51:42.010 --> 04:51:42.020 align:start position:0%
and in my view this bill is all about
 
04:51:45.230 --> 04:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
adapting to those changes
 
04:51:46.670 --> 04:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm here to represent the Lake
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee Sailing Association we are
 
04:51:52.730 --> 04:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
a non-profit that was formed in 1988 to
 
04:51:55.010 --> 04:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
teach sailing and promote boating safety
 
04:51:57.530 --> 04:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
to youngsters and their families
 
04:51:59.690 --> 04:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
we run one of the largest sailing
 
04:52:01.368 --> 04:52:01.378 align:start position:0%
schools in the Northeast
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
over the course of a summer we put over
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
300 youngsters on the water
 
04:52:09.708 --> 04:52:09.718 align:start position:0%
from ages 7 to 16 in small boats
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
we have a fleet of 35 sailboats and six
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
safety boats motor boats
 
04:52:18.590 --> 04:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
of that Fleet the majority are under
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
nine feet long
 
04:52:22.970 --> 04:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
this is the way to teach kids sailing
 
04:52:26.708 --> 04:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
these boats are fragile and vulnerable
 
04:52:30.530 --> 04:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
we we sail the younger kids in the
 
04:52:33.288 --> 04:52:33.298 align:start position:0%
sheltered coves and the older kids Sail
 
04:52:37.250 --> 04:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
on the broads in fact on a typical day
 
04:52:39.170 --> 04:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
we may have four or five groups on the
 
04:52:41.570 --> 04:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
water the more advanced kids in the open
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
Lake as I said
 
04:52:46.128 --> 04:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
when conditions permit the younger kids
 
04:52:48.288 --> 04:52:48.298 align:start position:0%
go out on the broads as well and
 
04:52:50.570 --> 04:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
interestingly they're most likely to be
 
04:52:52.610 --> 04:52:52.620 align:start position:0%
out there on the days that are most
 
04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
conducive to high-speed motorboating
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
that is light winds and small waves
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
further once a week the whole school has
 
04:53:02.030 --> 04:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
a full day outing and they sail across
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
the broads to ragged Islands
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
now I have been the organization's youth
 
04:53:09.170 --> 04:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
sailing chairman for about 20 years
 
04:53:11.390 --> 04:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
and hardly a day goes by that I don't
 
04:53:13.610 --> 04:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
think about the risks of putting other
 
04:53:15.470 --> 04:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
people's kids in the water in small
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
boats it's a scary proposition
 
04:53:23.208 --> 04:53:23.218 align:start position:0%
45 miles an hour is plenty fast enough
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk today about
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
restricting the speed limits or having
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
the speed limits unrestricted in the
 
04:53:29.760 --> 04:53:31.670 align:start position:0%
the speed limits unrestricted in the
broads

04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
broads
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous and really unenforceable as
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
somebody said the broads are Lake
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee is a hub
 
04:53:40.490 --> 04:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
votes go at all speeds in all directions
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
while at the same time other people have
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
stopped to smell the roses to swim to
 
04:53:48.890 --> 04:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
picnic or to sunbathe I shudder at the
 
04:53:50.690 --> 04:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
thought of an ocean-going speedboat
 
04:53:53.150 --> 04:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
charging through that scene at 80 to 100
 
04:53:55.310 --> 04:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
miles an hour
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you 45 miles an hour is plenty
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
fast enough
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
further on the broads
 
04:54:05.930 --> 04:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
if you ask 10 experienced locals about
 
04:54:07.850 --> 04:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of the broads you likely
 
04:54:10.368 --> 04:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
get 10 answers maybe more and yesterday
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
I looked at a chart to see if I could
 
04:54:15.410 --> 04:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
outline the area in question and I ended
 
04:54:17.570 --> 04:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
up with more questions is the northern
 
04:54:20.090 --> 04:54:20.100 align:start position:0%
boundary at Steamboat Island is it a
 
04:54:22.550 --> 04:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
bear island is it a six mile island
 
04:54:24.770 --> 04:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
does the broads extend inside of Welsh
 
04:54:26.990 --> 04:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
island east of Five Mile Island thank
 
04:54:30.288 --> 04:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
you and where does it end to the South
 
04:54:32.930 --> 04:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
imagine a visitor launching a speedboat
 
04:54:34.850 --> 04:54:34.860 align:start position:0%
for the weekend he won't have a clue
 
04:54:38.090 --> 04:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
about the boundaries so uh in interest
 
04:54:41.090 --> 04:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
of time I'll cut my remarks off here I
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
hope this committee considers not
 
04:54:47.208 --> 04:54:47.218 align:start position:0%
passing House Bill 1424. thank you
 
04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
04:54:49.080 --> 04:54:50.090 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
committee

04:54:50.090 --> 04:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:59.690 --> 04:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
I think you left your mask over there
 
04:54:59.700 --> 04:55:00.708 align:start position:0%
I think you left your mask over there
sir

04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
sir
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
your mask is that yours on the table
 
04:55:06.530 --> 04:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:16.910 --> 04:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
three minutes if you cancer I appreciate
 
04:55:22.490 --> 04:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
hi there everybody
 
04:55:25.550 --> 04:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
um first of all thank you for your time
 
04:55:28.430 --> 04:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I hope you're all doing well I'm
 
04:55:31.490 --> 04:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
here to testify in opposition to HB 1424
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
because I know from personal experience
 
04:55:36.110 --> 04:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
at the 45 30 mile an hour speed limit
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
works for the lake I feel safe in a
 
04:55:41.330 --> 04:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
small silver and for a kayak or with my
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
whole family and our Runabout because I
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
know that if I follow the current laws
 
04:55:47.150 --> 04:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
and in Vigilant I can avoid another
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
boater traveling at 45 miles per less or
 
04:55:52.010 --> 04:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
less can you hear me all right by the
 
04:55:54.530 --> 04:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
way in here okay
 
04:55:58.250 --> 04:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
um so my topics my topics are speed
 
04:56:01.128 --> 04:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
kills how we make the roads safe and how
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
that relates to the lake
 
04:56:05.810 --> 04:56:05.820 align:start position:0%
I live on the broads and what I see and
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
finally the fast boats that are
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
available today the Insurance Institute
 
04:56:12.170 --> 04:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
for Highway Safety said in 2019 that for
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
every five miles per hour you increase
 
04:56:16.490 --> 04:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
speeds on a highway you increase
 
04:56:19.070 --> 04:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
fatalities by 8.4 percent
 
04:56:22.250 --> 04:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's common sense it's high speed you
 
04:56:23.930 --> 04:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
have less time to react to prevent an
 
04:56:26.510 --> 04:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
accident and the impact Force increases
 
04:56:28.128 --> 04:56:28.138 align:start position:0%
with speed
 
04:56:29.868 --> 04:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
accordingly the highest speed limit on
 
04:56:31.850 --> 04:56:31.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is 70 miles per hour
 
04:56:34.910 --> 04:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
not unlimited and that is only on the
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
most advanced Highway in the state these
 
04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
roads are intentionally designed for
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
high-speed safety and to keep fast
 
04:56:43.610 --> 04:56:43.620 align:start position:0%
moving cars away from roads with
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
pedestrians animals and slower cars we
 
04:56:48.288 --> 04:56:48.298 align:start position:0%
put a lot of effort into making our
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
roads safe because it's part of a
 
04:56:51.350 --> 04:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
trade-off between the number of deaths
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
that could occur with higher speeds
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
while allowing goods and people to move
 
04:56:58.368 --> 04:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
at a rate that supports our economy
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's a trade-off that is a trade-off
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have to make on the lake
 
04:57:03.470 --> 04:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
when people are there to enjoy the water
 
04:57:04.850 --> 04:57:04.860 align:start position:0%
and have fun
 
04:57:06.650 --> 04:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
additionally piling a boat is nothing
 
04:57:09.650 --> 04:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
like driving a car the wind engine noise
 
04:57:12.110 --> 04:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
Sun waves and most of all all the other
 
04:57:13.730 --> 04:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
boaters are factors that affect safe
 
04:57:16.368 --> 04:57:16.378 align:start position:0%
voting the other people on the lake are
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
totally unpredictable as they have an
 
04:57:20.930 --> 04:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
amazing time on the water they drive in
 
04:57:22.610 --> 04:57:22.620 align:start position:0%
any direction they want they run at
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
different speeds they stop anywhere they
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
want none of these actions would be safe
 
04:57:28.490 --> 04:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
on a highway
 
04:57:30.530 --> 04:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
I live on the east side of Welch Island
 
04:57:31.970 --> 04:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
looking over the broads toward
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
wolfborough so I know the broads are
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
full of people enjoying the lake their
 
04:57:38.090 --> 04:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
numbers have been increasing because the
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
rest of the lake is getting more
 
04:57:42.110 --> 04:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
congested and the broads are less busy
 
04:57:44.208 --> 04:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
and beautiful place to be
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
another thing I see is that people don't
 
04:57:48.170 --> 04:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
always obey the laws of the lake they
 
04:57:50.090 --> 04:57:50.100 align:start position:0%
drive too close to other boats forget
 
04:57:53.150 --> 04:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
that 150 foot thing they don't they
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
don't give way when the other person has
 
04:57:56.810 --> 04:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
the right of way and they drive on the
 
04:57:58.070 --> 04:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
wrong side of Bowie's to bark
 
04:57:59.750 --> 04:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
navigational hazards
 
04:58:02.448 --> 04:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
and then add unlimited speeds to this
 
04:58:05.690 --> 04:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
behavior and you greatly increase risk
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
if the decisions made to increase the
 
04:58:10.010 --> 04:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
speed limit thank you on the broads then
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
how would the department of safety make
 
04:58:13.850 --> 04:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
it safe for other voters the broads
 
04:58:15.530 --> 04:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
cannot easily be isolated from the rest
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the lake like our highways are from
 
04:58:19.550 --> 04:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of our roads nor should they be
 
04:58:21.708 --> 04:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
as that would make the largest part of
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
the lake unavailable for the majority of
 
04:58:24.240 --> 04:58:25.368 align:start position:0%
the lake unavailable for the majority of
boaters

04:58:25.368 --> 04:58:25.378 align:start position:0%
boaters
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
finally last week I did some calling
 
04:58:30.288 --> 04:58:30.298 align:start position:0%
around to boat manufacturers there are a
 
04:58:32.750 --> 04:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
lot of very fast boats available there
 
04:58:34.430 --> 04:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
are production boats that will easily do
 
04:58:37.448 --> 04:58:37.458 align:start position:0%
100 miles per hour with some as fast as
 
04:58:40.368 --> 04:58:40.378 align:start position:0%
175 miles per hour and you know people
 
04:58:43.250 --> 04:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
will get them and want to run them we
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
have very fast cars on our roads too
 
04:58:48.590 --> 04:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
some can go over 200 miles per hour but
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
04:58:51.830 --> 04:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
speed limits keep us safe
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:56.410 --> 04:58:56.420 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
04:59:03.050 --> 04:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:05.448 --> 04:59:05.458 align:start position:0%
next up is
 
04:59:16.610 --> 04:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
I told the other Witnesses I would
 
04:59:24.890 --> 04:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
to the members of the House
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation committee my name is
 
04:59:30.410 --> 04:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
Brian Hennessey you've already heard
 
04:59:32.330 --> 04:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
many of the arguments regarding safety
 
04:59:35.208 --> 04:59:35.218 align:start position:0%
and why HP 1424 is a danger to the
 
04:59:37.850 --> 04:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
voters on Winnipesaukee I however want
 
04:59:40.010 --> 04:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
to discuss two other reasons why this
 
04:59:42.890 --> 04:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
bill should be voted Ito number one our
 
04:59:45.230 --> 04:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
local economy prior to the passage of
 
04:59:46.910 --> 04:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
the speed limit Winnipesaukee had
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
suffered from a reputation as being a
 
04:59:51.288 --> 04:59:51.298 align:start position:0%
cowboy Wild West destination several
 
04:59:53.390 --> 04:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
fatal and high profile accidents
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
involving high-powered speed boats had
 
04:59:57.770 --> 04:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
contributed to this reputation and this
 
05:00:00.350 --> 05:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
is why over 300 businesses signed in to
 
05:00:02.510 --> 05:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
support the speed limit law we worked
 
05:00:04.430 --> 05:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
very hard over 10 years ago to adopt
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
speed limits on the lake and can the
 
05:00:08.208 --> 05:00:08.218 align:start position:0%
test that they have made a remarkable
 
05:00:10.550 --> 05:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
difference on the improved atmosphere of
 
05:00:12.350 --> 05:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
tranquility and safety for all who
 
05:00:14.030 --> 05:00:14.040 align:start position:0%

05:02:52.930 --> 05:02:52.940 align:start position:0%
no could you finish just okay all right
 
05:02:56.690 --> 05:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
let's not fool ourselves HB 1424 is bad
 
05:02:58.490 --> 05:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
for our local economy and having worked
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
in many tourist related businesses in
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
the state I can tell you that every
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
tourist dollar counts and if we're to
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
remain the Live Free or Die state with
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
low taxes we cannot afford to lose
 
05:03:12.650 --> 05:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
Taurus dollars thank you thank you
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:39.410 --> 05:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
I think so I think so
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:46.320 --> 05:03:48.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:03:48.770 --> 05:03:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:50.990 --> 05:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
how are you I'm Gary Connolly a
 
05:03:53.930 --> 05:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
waterfront owner of Alton I am a person
 
05:03:56.448 --> 05:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
who was at all these meetings in the
 
05:03:58.970 --> 05:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
beginning and very disappointingly this
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
was passed with very slow facts no one
 
05:04:05.390 --> 05:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
has come up here today and told us how
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
many tickets are getting written per
 
05:04:07.020 --> 05:04:07.970 align:start position:0%
many tickets are getting written per
year

05:04:07.970 --> 05:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:04:09.530 --> 05:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that is probably
 
05:04:11.448 --> 05:04:11.458 align:start position:0%
spent through Marine Patrol and time
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
wasted chasing boats around is very very
 
05:04:16.368 --> 05:04:16.378 align:start position:0%
concerning when there's a lot of other
 
05:04:20.090 --> 05:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
things going on we're really not writing
 
05:04:21.948 --> 05:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
the amount of tickets that we are out on
 
05:04:23.810 --> 05:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
the highway not one person has come up
 
05:04:25.970 --> 05:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
with facts you know the best thing we
 
05:04:28.368 --> 05:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
have on our side we have had this built
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
for 14 years if you this excuse me if
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
this committee looks at the facts
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed zero there is no
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's not any safer all the accidents
 
05:04:42.288 --> 05:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
they're talking about this is nothing of
 
05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they're talking about
 
05:04:45.470 --> 05:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
stuff in the United States we're talking
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
about our Lake we have the facts and it
 
05:04:51.170 --> 05:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
is very easy to see and I'm very curious
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
what kind of money is spent you know
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
through these Marine patrols to enforce
 
05:04:57.170 --> 05:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
this and what kind of Revenue is coming
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
back we need this revenue for voting
 
05:04:59.520 --> 05:05:01.070 align:start position:0%
back we need this revenue for voting
education

05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we're getting a ton of
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
influx of rental boats those
 
05:05:07.128 --> 05:05:07.138 align:start position:0%
unfortunately are going to become the
 
05:05:09.170 --> 05:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
more of the issue because the you know
 
05:05:10.730 --> 05:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how fast you're going
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
if you're an experienced you're going to
 
05:05:15.170 --> 05:05:15.180 align:start position:0%
hurt people and they don't get it and
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's 60 70 votes coming out of some
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
of these marinas and that's just one
 
05:05:21.530 --> 05:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
Marina so where should we be spending
 
05:05:23.510 --> 05:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
our money here it should be on education
 
05:05:25.490 --> 05:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
and educating these people who are
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
getting out on the lake I mean I've been
 
05:05:30.170 --> 05:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
on my the lake my entire life yes there
 
05:05:32.090 --> 05:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
are a bunch of bad apples but there's
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
very few most of these hyper high
 
05:05:36.650 --> 05:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
performance boat owners are spending
 
05:05:38.270 --> 05:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
great amounts of money in our Lakes
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
Region and our economy and a lot of them
 
05:05:42.350 --> 05:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
have gotten driven out because of the
 
05:05:45.410 --> 05:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
speed limit and unfortunately the other
 
05:05:47.570 --> 05:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
side they're not they don't register
 
05:05:50.208 --> 05:05:50.218 align:start position:0%
their kayaks and paddle boats and stuff
 
05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
like that they're not contributing
 
05:05:53.810 --> 05:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
they're coming they're paddling they're
 
05:05:56.570 --> 05:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
leaving I challenge how many people are
 
05:05:58.730 --> 05:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
actually Waterfront owners here that are
 
05:06:01.010 --> 05:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
actually you know really seeing this
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
Lake every day I mean it's there's a lot
 
05:06:05.270 --> 05:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
of days on that Lake that it's a ghost
 
05:06:07.550 --> 05:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
town there should be no reason that
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be a Live Free or Die
 
05:06:10.970 --> 05:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
and be able to get out there and enjoy
 
05:06:14.208 --> 05:06:14.218 align:start position:0%
yourself and go faster than the posted
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
speed limit at this time
 
05:06:18.890 --> 05:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time
 
05:06:22.128 --> 05:06:22.138 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
05:06:24.350 --> 05:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:06:24.360 --> 05:06:30.708 align:start position:0%
seeing none
you

05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:37.788 --> 05:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:39.170 --> 05:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
you've got the right amount of time on
 
05:06:39.180 --> 05:06:47.090 align:start position:0%
you've got the right amount of time on
this

05:06:47.090 --> 05:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.730 --> 05:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Bob Conrad I'm a
 
05:06:52.430 --> 05:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
resident of Wolfeboro and owner of North
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
Water Marine formerly thurston's in
 
05:06:55.868 --> 05:06:55.878 align:start position:0%
Weirs Beach
 
05:06:58.970 --> 05:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
while I became a marine owner in 2021
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
I've been a property owner on the lake
 
05:07:03.948 --> 05:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
on Lake Winnipesaukee since 2000 and a
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
boater since
 
05:07:05.360 --> 05:07:06.948 align:start position:0%
boater since
1995

05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
1995
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
so I have experienced the lake with and
 
05:07:13.250 --> 05:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
without speed limits and oppose HB 1424
 
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
as a boater I do not want to return to
 
05:07:17.330 --> 05:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
the days of being intimidated and
 
05:07:19.550 --> 05:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
endangered by high-speed boats anywhere
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
on the lake I personally had multiple
 
05:07:23.690 --> 05:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
dangerous encounters with high-speed
 
05:07:26.448 --> 05:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
boats failing to yield the right away
 
05:07:28.850 --> 05:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
creating anxiety for everyone in my
 
05:07:28.860 --> 05:07:29.930 align:start position:0%
creating anxiety for everyone in my
party

05:07:29.930 --> 05:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
party
 
05:07:32.868 --> 05:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
as a marina owner on Lake Winnipesaukee
 
05:07:35.208 --> 05:07:35.218 align:start position:0%
our business depends on families feeling
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable and safe boating on all
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
areas of the lake
 
05:07:41.810 --> 05:07:41.820 align:start position:0%
families often multi-generational are
 
05:07:43.550 --> 05:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
attracted to the lake which drives the
 
05:07:45.770 --> 05:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
local economy through real estate and
 
05:07:48.530 --> 05:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
businesses on and off the water removing
 
05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
the lake speed limit or increasing it is
 
05:07:52.970 --> 05:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
a serious risk to that attraction for
 
05:07:55.788 --> 05:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
families in the local economy
 
05:07:57.948 --> 05:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
people with fast cars are expected to
 
05:07:59.810 --> 05:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
comply with speed limits on public roads
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
for the safety of all I think it's also
 
05:08:04.670 --> 05:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation that there are
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
speed limits on the lake for the safety
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
hole so as a resident voter and business
 
05:08:12.770 --> 05:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
owner I oppose HB 1424 and ask that you
 
05:08:15.050 --> 05:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
oppose it as well thank you
 
05:08:19.010 --> 05:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
05:08:21.530 --> 05:08:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative tolarski thank you Mr
 
05:08:22.730 --> 05:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
question as a marine owner I felt you
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
might be a good person to ask this
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
question I'm specifically concerned
 
05:08:31.490 --> 05:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
about the wording in this bill
 
05:08:33.650 --> 05:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
where it starts with where no Hazard
 
05:08:37.368 --> 05:08:37.378 align:start position:0%
exists not being a boater I I don't know
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
if if voters are aware of all the
 
05:08:41.330 --> 05:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
hazards around them maybe you could
 
05:08:44.690 --> 05:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit about that and the
 
05:08:46.910 --> 05:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
other thing is the other question would
 
05:08:48.770 --> 05:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
go for someone else so just that about
 
05:08:52.128 --> 05:08:52.138 align:start position:0%
that where where no Hazard exists
 
05:08:54.708 --> 05:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
so your question is I'm not sure I
 
05:08:56.510 --> 05:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
understand your question okay the bill
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
itself says
 
05:09:01.610 --> 05:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
where no Hazard exists that requires
 
05:09:05.150 --> 05:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
lower speed for compliance
 
05:09:07.490 --> 05:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
the speed will drop so it's basically
 
05:09:10.070 --> 05:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
saying that the driver of the boat would
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
be aware oh excuse me where there could
 
05:09:15.230 --> 05:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
be a hazard do you think that a
 
05:09:17.810 --> 05:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
someone in control of a boat can be
 
05:09:20.690 --> 05:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
fully aware of all hazards in the lake
 
05:09:22.368 --> 05:09:22.378 align:start position:0%
particularly if they are an out of town
 
05:09:25.310 --> 05:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
tourist who's never navigated in this
 
05:09:28.010 --> 05:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
body of water well I I believe the
 
05:09:30.410 --> 05:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
answer to that is no people do not are
 
05:09:32.090 --> 05:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
not aware of all hazards on the lake and
 
05:09:34.430 --> 05:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
as a marina owner we rent a small Fleet
 
05:09:36.530 --> 05:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
of boats many of those come back damaged
 
05:09:39.110 --> 05:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
simply because nobody knows where all
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
the hazards are on the lake and those
 
05:09:42.590 --> 05:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
boats are not capable of actually going
 
05:09:45.770 --> 05:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:48.890 --> 05:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
05:09:57.948 --> 05:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.930 --> 05:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.090 --> 05:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
my name is Douglas Joseph I'm an
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeon in Nashua since 1980.
 
05:10:29.330 --> 05:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
and a boater on the lake for 40 years
 
05:10:31.730 --> 05:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm adding my opposition
 
05:10:34.910 --> 05:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
that helps build 1424.
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
my support is to keep the 45-30 law on
 
05:10:41.150 --> 05:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
the lake as it is
 
05:10:43.190 --> 05:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
with no changes
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense to change a law that
 
05:10:47.990 --> 05:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
is working as it was intended
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
making the lake safer by slowing all
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
motorized boaters down
 
05:10:56.090 --> 05:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
this includes keeping the 45-30 for the
 
05:10:56.100 --> 05:10:57.050 align:start position:0%
this includes keeping the 45-30 for the
broads

05:10:57.050 --> 05:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
broads
 
05:11:00.170 --> 05:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
which composes a large portion of the
 
05:11:01.368 --> 05:11:01.378 align:start position:0%
lake center
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
we vote regularly to the broads to go to
 
05:11:06.890 --> 05:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
wolfborough Tuftonboro or to Center
 
05:11:09.890 --> 05:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
Harbor for dinner shopping
 
05:11:13.850 --> 05:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
and repair items as a physician involved
 
05:11:18.050 --> 05:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
with trauma for the last 30 40 years I
 
05:11:20.570 --> 05:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
can directly attest to the dangers of
 
05:11:22.070 --> 05:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
high-speed injuries on our Lakes
 
05:11:25.010 --> 05:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
highways injuries in boating accidents
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
are no different except that they may
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
also involve drowning
 
05:11:31.970 --> 05:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
boat to boat crashes can be just as
 
05:11:35.090 --> 05:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
devastating as with cars high-speed
 
05:11:38.448 --> 05:11:38.458 align:start position:0%
voters cause injury and even death to
 
05:11:43.010 --> 05:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
lower slower speed sailors kayakers
 
05:11:47.390 --> 05:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
water skiers tubers and paddle boat and
 
05:11:47.400 --> 05:11:49.010 align:start position:0%
water skiers tubers and paddle boat and
swimmers

05:11:49.010 --> 05:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
swimmers
 
05:11:51.770 --> 05:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
just like cars striking motorcyclists
 
05:11:55.010 --> 05:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
bicyclists and pedestrians I have seen
 
05:11:56.810 --> 05:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
these critical patients and treated
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
their grave injuries
 
05:12:00.530 --> 05:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
I have counseled their grieving families
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
after these horrifying accidents
 
05:12:06.350 --> 05:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
fortunately we have not seen these
 
05:12:07.550 --> 05:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
high-speed accidents on Lake
 
05:12:10.250 --> 05:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee for many years because of
 
05:12:14.330 --> 05:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
the 25 45 30 law has been has been
 
05:12:17.448 --> 05:12:17.458 align:start position:0%
working well since 2009.
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
the lake has been safer and more
 
05:12:22.190 --> 05:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
pleasurable over the last 13 years
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
my family votes back and forth from
 
05:12:27.530 --> 05:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
Ireland from our Island Camp to the
 
05:12:27.540 --> 05:12:28.850 align:start position:0%

mainland
 
05:12:30.288 --> 05:12:30.298 align:start position:0%
our trips have been much more
 
05:12:33.948 --> 05:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
comfortable and less anxiety
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
than it was before the law each time we
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
cross the channel before these speed
 
05:12:40.970 --> 05:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
limits we felt that we were voting for
 
05:12:42.110 --> 05:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
our lives
 
05:12:46.010 --> 05:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:48.410 --> 05:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
I might add that they ignore the 150
 
05:12:48.420 --> 05:12:50.930 align:start position:0%
I might add that they ignore the 150
rule

05:12:50.930 --> 05:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%

to the channel
and

05:12:53.570 --> 05:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
vote wherever they want to voting was
 
05:12:58.010 --> 05:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
not fun in those days it was terribly
 
05:12:58.020 --> 05:12:59.150 align:start position:0%
not fun in those days it was terribly
stressful

05:12:59.150 --> 05:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
stressful
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
please do not take us back to those
 
05:13:01.320 --> 05:13:02.030 align:start position:0%
please do not take us back to those
times

05:13:02.030 --> 05:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:13:07.850 --> 05:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
vote against HB 1424 and keep 45 30 as
 
05:13:10.730 --> 05:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
it is with no changes
 
05:13:13.368 --> 05:13:13.378 align:start position:0%
please keep us safe
 
05:13:14.570 --> 05:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you

thank you sir any questions

Avanti how close am I
 
05:13:43.970 --> 05:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
it works

Barbara fioravanti I thank you for this
 
05:14:06.170 --> 05:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address you with my
 
05:14:08.208 --> 05:14:08.218 align:start position:0%
concerns about safe voting on Lake
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee specifically with regard
 
05:14:13.730 --> 05:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
to speed limits I have been enjoying
 
05:14:16.128 --> 05:14:16.138 align:start position:0%
this beautiful Lake in Summers for some
 
05:14:19.570 --> 05:14:19.580 align:start position:0%
65 years and am now a proud year-round
 
05:14:23.330 --> 05:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
Lakefront resident of tufton borough
 
05:14:25.730 --> 05:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
I enjoy many types of water activities
 
05:14:28.730 --> 05:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
swimming kayaking sailing and
 
05:14:28.740 --> 05:14:30.590 align:start position:0%
swimming kayaking sailing and
motorboating

05:14:30.590 --> 05:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
motorboating
 
05:14:34.310 --> 05:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
and I also fly an amphibious aircraft
 
05:14:37.010 --> 05:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
I feel we all need to figure out ways to
 
05:14:39.650 --> 05:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
enjoy the lake without spoiling it for
 
05:14:39.660 --> 05:14:41.570 align:start position:0%
enjoy the lake without spoiling it for
others

05:14:41.570 --> 05:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
others
 
05:14:44.030 --> 05:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee is a large lake attractive
 
05:14:46.250 --> 05:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
to many types of boaters from campers
 
05:14:47.868 --> 05:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
and kayaks
 
05:14:50.090 --> 05:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
through families and pontoon boats and
 
05:14:52.610 --> 05:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
sailboats to operators of powerful
 
05:14:54.708 --> 05:14:54.718 align:start position:0%
high-speed Cruisers
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
the popularity of all types of boating
 
05:14:59.150 --> 05:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
on Winnipesaukee has increased
 
05:15:02.090 --> 05:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
exponentially as the density of boats
 
05:15:04.190 --> 05:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
traveling at different speeds increases
 
05:15:07.670 --> 05:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
so does the potential for conflict
 
05:15:10.730 --> 05:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
the 45 mile per hour a day 30 mile per
 
05:15:14.208 --> 05:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
hour Night speed limit was instituted to
 
05:15:16.550 --> 05:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the potential for deadly conflict
 
05:15:19.368 --> 05:15:19.378 align:start position:0%
and boat density has only increased
 
05:15:21.530 --> 05:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
since its Inception
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
HB 1424 is a proposal to eliminate the
 
05:15:27.948 --> 05:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
speed limit especially on the central
 
05:15:31.610 --> 05:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
part of the lake known as the broads so
 
05:15:33.288 --> 05:15:33.298 align:start position:0%
that high-speed boats could take
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of their capabilities of 60
 
05:15:38.570 --> 05:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
plus miles per hour
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
with that level of boat density that now
 
05:15:44.090 --> 05:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
exists that would mean that sailboats
 
05:15:47.628 --> 05:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
pontoon boats and other small craft but
 
05:15:49.970 --> 05:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
not safely operate in the broads or even
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
across from one side of the lake to the
 
05:15:52.080 --> 05:15:53.930 align:start position:0%
across from one side of the lake to the
other

05:15:53.930 --> 05:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
defining the length of the broads is a
 
05:15:58.190 --> 05:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
straight line from Robert's Cove to
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
Birch Island it's about 10 miles long
 
05:16:04.670 --> 05:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
at 60 miles per hour the trip would take
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
10 minutes at 45 miles per hour it would
 
05:16:11.090 --> 05:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
take just just over 13 minutes
 
05:16:13.610 --> 05:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone considers time
 
05:16:16.430 --> 05:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
saving as the motivation for traveling
 
05:16:19.730 --> 05:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
faster than 45 miles per hour in a boat
 
05:16:22.730 --> 05:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
on a lake it is of course the thrill of
 
05:16:25.010 --> 05:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
flying over the water as fast as you can
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
go maybe seeing if you're the fastest
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
boat on the lake
 
05:16:30.830 --> 05:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
the speed limit makes the dangerous
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
practice of racing less appealing as
 
05:16:36.590 --> 05:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
anyone traveling over 40 mile 45 miles
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
per hour is subject to a stop by Marine
 
05:16:42.890 --> 05:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
Patrol with a possible ticket and
 
05:16:45.288 --> 05:16:45.298 align:start position:0%
further investigation of the condition
 
05:16:48.410 --> 05:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
of the boat and the operator
 
05:16:51.050 --> 05:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
I strongly urge the committee to reject
 
05:16:55.128 --> 05:16:55.138 align:start position:0%
HB 1424 in the interest of safety for
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
all those who enjoy Lake Winnipesaukee
 
05:16:59.628 --> 05:16:59.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening thank you ma'am
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:17:28.010 --> 05:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.128 --> 05:17:36.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Downey Mr Downey
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
yeah my name is John hello
 
05:17:44.990 --> 05:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Downey if you have written testimony
 
05:17:46.970 --> 05:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
could you maybe just summarize what
 
05:17:49.150 --> 05:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to have in yourself
 
05:17:51.470 --> 05:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
quick move things along even better
 
05:17:55.250 --> 05:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yep thank you
 
05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
so my name is Sean Downey from Merrimack
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I've been uh boating for
 
05:18:02.930 --> 05:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
30 years I am one of those so-called uh
 
05:18:05.990 --> 05:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
high performance experts I'd say as I
 
05:18:08.990 --> 05:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
got 15 years experience with those boats
 
05:18:11.570 --> 05:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of the statements that have made
 
05:18:13.910 --> 05:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
about them are incorrect
 
05:18:16.970 --> 05:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
okay uh you know the land of a football
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
field to stop at 45 is absolutely
 
05:18:19.440 --> 05:18:20.750 align:start position:0%
field to stop at 45 is absolutely
ridiculous

05:18:20.750 --> 05:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
05:18:20.760 --> 05:18:22.490 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
uh

05:18:22.490 --> 05:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:24.890 --> 05:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
you know I just to educate some of you
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
that might not be
 
05:18:29.150 --> 05:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
Otis or even know Lake Winnipesaukee
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
it's huge
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
the broads itself from Guilford to Cow
 
05:18:37.310 --> 05:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
Island about three miles
 
05:18:40.670 --> 05:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
from Welch Island to Wolfeboro
 
05:18:42.288 --> 05:18:42.298 align:start position:0%
six miles
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's 18 square miles of space
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's tremendous
 
05:18:51.288 --> 05:18:51.298 align:start position:0%
and at any given day on in the summer
 
05:18:53.090 --> 05:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
again I've been bowling there for a long
 
05:18:53.100 --> 05:18:53.990 align:start position:0%
again I've been bowling there for a long
time

05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:18:57.170 --> 05:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
there might be 10 bolts in the broads in
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
18 square miles
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
and just to prove that to you you can
 
05:19:04.128 --> 05:19:04.138 align:start position:0%
Google Lake Winnipesaukee and pull up
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
the lake
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
on the satellite and count the boats on
 
05:19:09.948 --> 05:19:09.958 align:start position:0%
a summer's day
 
05:19:13.670 --> 05:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the sand bars are loaded
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
with boats
 
05:19:16.970 --> 05:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
so it's going to give you an accurate
 
05:19:19.550 --> 05:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
description that it is a very busy day
 
05:19:22.190 --> 05:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
and you can count them that also goes
 
05:19:24.530 --> 05:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
for Welch Island all the way to Santa
 
05:19:27.350 --> 05:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
Harbor which is eight miles
 
05:19:31.190 --> 05:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's a huge body of water that lots of
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
people can have fun on
 
05:19:36.288 --> 05:19:36.298 align:start position:0%
but yet everybody wants to complain that
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's dangerous in the broads a lot of
 
05:19:41.570 --> 05:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
people barely go near the branch they're
 
05:19:44.868 --> 05:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
in all the Bays if you look again at
 
05:19:47.448 --> 05:19:47.458 align:start position:0%
that Google Map you'll see that Meredith
 
05:19:50.090 --> 05:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
Bay is busy you'll see that pogus bay is
 
05:19:51.708 --> 05:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
busy you'll see that there's a lot of
 
05:19:53.570 --> 05:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
traffic going into Alden
 
05:19:55.910 --> 05:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
those are the busy areas
 
05:19:59.208 --> 05:19:59.218 align:start position:0%
but the broads are wide open there's
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
plenty of space there for all of us
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
not to mention I know there's a lot of
 
05:20:07.250 --> 05:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
kayakers and paddle boarders and you
 
05:20:11.030 --> 05:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
know small fishing boats is 800 plus
 
05:20:13.550 --> 05:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
lakes and ponds in New Hampshire
 
05:20:17.208 --> 05:20:17.218 align:start position:0%
why is it that Lake Winnipesaukee the
 
05:20:20.810 --> 05:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
only big body of water in New Hampshire
 
05:20:23.690 --> 05:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
has to be a victim
 
05:20:26.810 --> 05:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
to to uh the performance Focus that want
 
05:20:29.330 --> 05:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
to go out and enjoy the lake too
 
05:20:31.850 --> 05:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of money on these boats
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
we should be able to have fun when it's
 
05:20:34.320 --> 05:20:35.330 align:start position:0%
we should be able to have fun when it's
safe

05:20:35.330 --> 05:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
safe
 
05:20:37.250 --> 05:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know I understand some people get
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
scared but there's a 150 foot rule in
 
05:20:41.160 --> 05:20:42.170 align:start position:0%
scared but there's a 150 foot rule in
place

05:20:42.170 --> 05:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:20:45.650 --> 05:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
to guarantee that we're not near them
 
05:20:48.288 --> 05:20:48.298 align:start position:0%
and trust me when I say when we're going
 
05:20:51.410 --> 05:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
65 70 miles an hour we don't want
 
05:20:53.628 --> 05:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
anything to do with being near them
 
05:20:53.638 --> 05:20:54.890 align:start position:0%
anything to do with being near them
nothing

05:20:54.890 --> 05:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:20:57.650 --> 05:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
because they're unpredictable too
 
05:21:00.288 --> 05:21:00.298 align:start position:0%
especially the rent is
 
05:21:02.510 --> 05:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
These Guys these people are coming up on
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
the weekends renting boats with no
 
05:21:07.610 --> 05:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
experience zero
 
05:21:10.310 --> 05:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
they take a short course they give them
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
the keys to the boat and they say have a
 
05:21:15.170 --> 05:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
great day they don't know the lake they
 
05:21:17.330 --> 05:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
don't own the laws they don't know the
 
05:21:17.340 --> 05:21:18.530 align:start position:0%
don't own the laws they don't know the
buoys

05:21:18.530 --> 05:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
buoys
 
05:21:20.770 --> 05:21:20.780 align:start position:0%
they don't pay attention when they turn
 
05:21:22.850 --> 05:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
those are the people that are the
 
05:21:25.548 --> 05:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
problem not us
 
05:21:28.128 --> 05:21:28.138 align:start position:0%
I hope you guys can see that
 
05:21:32.208 --> 05:21:32.218 align:start position:0%
that lake is gigantic sir
 
05:21:35.330 --> 05:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions I appreciate it
 
05:21:51.470 --> 05:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:54.590 --> 05:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
Kathy Boselli
 
05:21:57.048 --> 05:21:57.058 align:start position:0%
one to two minutes that'd be great
 
05:21:58.970 --> 05:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
the very best
 
05:22:01.788 --> 05:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
just uh my name is Kathy vaselli I'm a
 
05:22:03.288 --> 05:22:03.298 align:start position:0%
resident of Guilford New Hampshire I
 
05:22:05.448 --> 05:22:05.458 align:start position:0%
live on an island six months of the year
 
05:22:07.970 --> 05:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
and I've been there for 40 years like
 
05:22:10.190 --> 05:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
many others I've seen huge changes on
 
05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
the lake and I have three things I want
 
05:22:14.208 --> 05:22:14.218 align:start position:0%
to say quickly try to define the broads
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
and everyone will come up with a
 
05:22:17.810 --> 05:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
different opinion so if you're trying to
 
05:22:20.090 --> 05:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
use that body of water and Define it and
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
enforce it
 
05:22:23.448 --> 05:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be very very
 
05:22:26.570 --> 05:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
challenging yes this is 150 feet I see
 
05:22:28.910 --> 05:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
violations of it of that as a safety
 
05:22:31.070 --> 05:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
zone every single time I go out of my
 
05:22:32.570 --> 05:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
boat I'm trying to teach my
 
05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
grandchildren safe boating and we're the
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
ones who have to make accommodations for
 
05:22:39.530 --> 05:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
those who are not following that rule
 
05:22:41.690 --> 05:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
um I cannot take my grandchildren into
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
the broads which is right next to where
 
05:22:45.890 --> 05:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
I live to go water ski or tubing on
 
05:22:48.048 --> 05:22:48.058 align:start position:0%
weekends because there are not 10 boats
 
05:22:50.448 --> 05:22:50.458 align:start position:0%
there's way more than 10 boats we have
 
05:22:53.390 --> 05:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
to avoid that area for safety reasons
 
05:22:55.690 --> 05:22:55.700 align:start position:0%
I'm also here to speak on the behalf of
 
05:22:58.610 --> 05:22:58.620 align:start position:0%

testimony to be read into the record 11
 
05:23:17.090 --> 05:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
years ago on April 19 2011 I testified
 
05:23:21.048 --> 05:23:21.058 align:start position:0%
against SB 27 a bill to remove the speed
 
05:23:23.270 --> 05:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
limits on Lake winnsasaki just like
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%

one those Communications were in
 
05:23:37.070 --> 05:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to removing speed limits the
 
05:23:39.048 --> 05:23:39.058 align:start position:0%
communications came from residents
 
05:23:41.208 --> 05:23:41.218 align:start position:0%

message was keep the current speed
 
05:23:49.490 --> 05:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
limits in place and the legislature
 
05:23:51.650 --> 05:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
listened since the speed limit has been
 
05:23:54.410 --> 05:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
in place people feel safer and use and
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
enjoy the lake more Lake Winnipesaukee
 
05:23:58.368 --> 05:23:58.378 align:start position:0%
is user friendly and accommodates
 
05:24:00.288 --> 05:24:00.298 align:start position:0%
everyone from kayakers and swimmers to
 
05:24:02.448 --> 05:24:02.458 align:start position:0%
fishermen and boaters during testimony
 
05:24:05.690 --> 05:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
in 2011 I always I also spoke from a
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
personal experience as a boat owner and
 
05:24:10.610 --> 05:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
passenger over 40 years ago on the Labor
 
05:24:12.890 --> 05:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
Day weekend I almost lost my mom and
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
Young Brother in a boating accident
 
05:24:16.610 --> 05:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
including my father we were all
 
05:24:18.410 --> 05:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
passengers on a boat that hit a
 
05:24:21.110 --> 05:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
Breakwater at top speed the owner and
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
experienced voter and close friend of
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
the family lost control and as a
 
05:24:27.048 --> 05:24:27.058 align:start position:0%
consequence my mom ended up in a coma
 
05:24:29.090 --> 05:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
when she was tossed from the back of the
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
boat and hit her head on the galley door
 
05:24:33.470 --> 05:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
my brother lost his spleen when he was
 
05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
thrown through the window my dad and I
 
05:24:37.190 --> 05:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
both suffered broken ribs and
 
05:24:39.530 --> 05:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous injuries I'm sure our
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
family friend believed he was operating
 
05:24:43.490 --> 05:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
The Vessel at a safe speed that was
 
05:24:45.530 --> 05:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
reasonable and prudent but his judgment
 
05:24:48.110 --> 05:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
was wrong and the injury suffered by my
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
family had real negative and permanent
 
05:24:52.548 --> 05:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
results I urge the members of the
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee to vote against hp1424 because
 
05:24:58.490 --> 05:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
the current limits are working thank you
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
Genie Forester thank you could we have
 
05:25:04.490 --> 05:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
that for yes for Clark
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.128 --> 05:25:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:00.350 --> 05:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
three minutes please my name is John
 
05:26:03.288 --> 05:26:03.298 align:start position:0%
Spooner good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
05:26:03.298 --> 05:26:05.448 align:start position:0%
Spooner good afternoon Mr chairman and
committee

05:26:05.448 --> 05:26:05.458 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:26:05.458 --> 05:26:06.948 align:start position:0%
committee
um

05:26:06.948 --> 05:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:09.530 --> 05:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
my grandfather bought diamond island in
 
05:26:09.540 --> 05:26:11.030 align:start position:0%
my grandfather bought diamond island in
1931.

05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
1931.
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
and he had had a high performance Chris
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
Craft that went 64 miles an hour
 
05:26:18.048 --> 05:26:18.058 align:start position:0%
and he'd given that boat up when he was
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh 67 years old because he thought his
 
05:26:25.250 --> 05:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
reaction time had dulled down but I was
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
conceived I was an ice out baby I've
 
05:26:30.530 --> 05:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
spent I'm 54 years old and I've been
 
05:26:33.590 --> 05:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
boating for 49 years I got a boat when I
 
05:26:35.150 --> 05:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
was five years old
 
05:26:37.850 --> 05:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
currently I have four high performance
 
05:26:37.860 --> 05:26:38.990 align:start position:0%
currently I have four high performance
boats

05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
boats
 
05:26:39.000 --> 05:26:40.670 align:start position:0%
boats
and

05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:40.680 --> 05:26:41.208 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:26:41.208 --> 05:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:45.048 --> 05:26:45.058 align:start position:0%
I feel as though the speed limit should
 
05:26:48.410 --> 05:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
be pulled in the broads it comes down to
 
05:26:51.048 --> 05:26:51.058 align:start position:0%
more about boater etiquette and
 
05:26:51.058 --> 05:26:52.490 align:start position:0%
more about boater etiquette and
education

05:26:52.490 --> 05:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:26:54.530 --> 05:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe that a kayaker
 
05:26:56.690 --> 05:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
should be in the broads to be honest
 
05:26:58.788 --> 05:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
with you that's just common sense it'd
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
be it's a little bit different these
 
05:27:03.470 --> 05:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
days there are more and more boats
 
05:27:03.480 --> 05:27:04.490 align:start position:0%
days there are more and more boats
but

05:27:04.490 --> 05:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:27:07.628 --> 05:27:07.638 align:start position:0%
it seems as though it's the other people
 
05:27:11.090 --> 05:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
who do not know the rules on this Lake
 
05:27:14.030 --> 05:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
and I see it every day and they can be
 
05:27:15.890 --> 05:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
going 25 miles an hour
 
05:27:18.530 --> 05:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
and they're throwing out a bigger wake
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
they're within 150 feet
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
so all I'm saying is that I think they
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
need more more education
 
05:27:27.890 --> 05:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
about safety
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
and speed
 
05:27:33.470 --> 05:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
I don't see it as an issue in the bronze
 
05:27:35.390 --> 05:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:38.150 --> 05:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:50.090 --> 05:27:50.100 align:start position:0%

05:27:57.708 --> 05:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony you could
 
05:27:59.270 --> 05:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
probably just summarize and that would
 
05:28:02.208 --> 05:28:02.218 align:start position:0%
be great okay yeah thank you thank you
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
so much I'm Diana McNabb and in the
 
05:28:07.850 --> 05:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
summer I live on Welch Island
 
05:28:11.150 --> 05:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
and that overlooks the broads and so far
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
we've heard so many good reasons to
 
05:28:15.890 --> 05:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
um what I was what I picture when I look
 
05:28:20.208 --> 05:28:20.218 align:start position:0%
out over the broads
 
05:28:22.850 --> 05:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
in the summer is like an old-fashioned
 
05:28:26.390 --> 05:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
neighborhood where you see the big trees
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the kids playing and the
 
05:28:30.288 --> 05:28:30.298 align:start position:0%
skateboarding and the biking and the
 
05:28:32.448 --> 05:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
people coming and going but the lake
 
05:28:35.208 --> 05:28:35.218 align:start position:0%
version of it there's the water skiers
 
05:28:40.070 --> 05:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
and the families boating there's the um
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
two the kids tubing behind boats and
 
05:28:44.208 --> 05:28:44.218 align:start position:0%
falling off
 
05:28:46.070 --> 05:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
there is all the kids jumping off the
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
boats and swimming
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's the sailboat lessons and the
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
small boats with the grandkids learning
 
05:28:58.368 --> 05:28:58.378 align:start position:0%
how to boat on the water with the small
 
05:28:58.378 --> 05:29:00.128 align:start position:0%
how to boat on the water with the small
25

05:29:00.128 --> 05:29:00.138 align:start position:0%
25
 
05:29:03.650 --> 05:29:03.660 align:start position:0%
horsepower motors and of course this
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
the kayakers and paddle boarders and the
 
05:29:09.410 --> 05:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
kite borders and all these guys fall in
 
05:29:12.010 --> 05:29:12.020 align:start position:0%
the water and you can't see them
 
05:29:15.410 --> 05:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
so in the neighborhood there's speed
 
05:29:18.770 --> 05:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
limit on land and some
 
05:29:20.810 --> 05:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
on the water I think there should be a
 
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
speed limit to prevent the high-speed
 
05:29:24.650 --> 05:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
vehicles from barreling through the
 
05:29:24.660 --> 05:29:26.048 align:start position:0%
vehicles from barreling through the
neighborhood

05:29:26.048 --> 05:29:26.058 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
05:29:28.788 --> 05:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
I think the existing speed limit has
 
05:29:30.770 --> 05:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
worked well so I ask you to please
 
05:29:30.780 --> 05:29:31.970 align:start position:0%
worked well so I ask you to please
oppose

05:29:31.970 --> 05:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
05:29:35.810 --> 05:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
this HB 1424 and keep the speed limit
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you can we have that for
 
05:29:40.610 --> 05:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
written test for the clerk
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
um or no I can I emailed it okay thank
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:56.570 --> 05:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:10.670 --> 05:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if you have written testimony
 
05:30:12.830 --> 05:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
could you like somebody I set my
 
05:30:15.890 --> 05:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
testimony in I have a few copies here
 
05:30:18.110 --> 05:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
and so could you summarize what you had
 
05:30:21.650 --> 05:30:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:23.810 --> 05:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
think you try to hit a few points really
 
05:30:26.570 --> 05:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
quickly uh my name is Weldon Bosworth
 
05:30:28.430 --> 05:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm from Guilford I'm a part owner of
 
05:30:31.368 --> 05:30:31.378 align:start position:0%
Island property in Winnipesaukee uh
 
05:30:33.650 --> 05:30:33.660 align:start position:0%
before I retired as a marine biologist I
 
05:30:35.830 --> 05:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
spent many years on the ocean and lakes
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for the safety
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
of both boats and Personnel so I think I
 
05:30:45.048 --> 05:30:45.058 align:start position:0%
speak from a perspective of experience
 
05:30:47.208 --> 05:30:47.218 align:start position:0%
as well as training there's a few things
 
05:30:50.690 --> 05:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
I want to emphasize uh number one we
 
05:30:52.730 --> 05:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
talked about causes of accidents and
 
05:30:55.250 --> 05:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
where they all felt in the priority of
 
05:30:57.590 --> 05:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
causes in the Coast Guard statistics
 
05:31:00.890 --> 05:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
these are not independent they actually
 
05:31:02.990 --> 05:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
can work together so I'd just like to
 
05:31:05.570 --> 05:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
point out if you get in an accident for
 
05:31:08.030 --> 05:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
lack of attention and you're going fast
 
05:31:11.650 --> 05:31:11.660 align:start position:0%
the results are a lot worse number two
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
the force of an impact
 
05:31:19.010 --> 05:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
basically increases by
 
05:31:21.948 --> 05:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
a quadruple a doubling of a speed so
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
anytime there's an impact with either
 
05:31:26.690 --> 05:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
another person a place or a thing it's
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:33.230 --> 05:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
four times as much force the other thing
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to put is a lot of people have
 
05:31:38.030 --> 05:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
said the increased use of the lake
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
I'm a statistician as well I think we
 
05:31:42.590 --> 05:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
turn in terms speak in terms of
 
05:31:45.230 --> 05:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
probability that the more boats on the
 
05:31:47.390 --> 05:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
lake the higher the probability that
 
05:31:49.368 --> 05:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
sometimes somewhere people are going to
 
05:31:50.990 --> 05:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
get in trouble and this is particularly
 
05:31:53.090 --> 05:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
true as we've heard with a lot of
 
05:31:55.548 --> 05:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
inexperienced voters I think in the last
 
05:31:57.170 --> 05:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
10 years the number of people running
 
05:31:59.690 --> 05:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
pontoon boats and don't know a darn
 
05:32:01.850 --> 05:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
thing about rules of the road has
 
05:32:01.860 --> 05:32:03.350 align:start position:0%
thing about rules of the road has
tripled

05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
tripled
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
it isn't always clear sailing and flat
 
05:32:07.788 --> 05:32:07.798 align:start position:0%
water out there so I'm not concerned
 
05:32:10.128 --> 05:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
about people and it's flat calm it's
 
05:32:14.150 --> 05:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
when we have uh high winds and waves
 
05:32:17.868 --> 05:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
uh that's when the probability increases
 
05:32:20.570 --> 05:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
having speed zone speed zones has been
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
suggested here on the broads should work
 
05:32:25.128 --> 05:32:25.138 align:start position:0%
both ways if we're going to control the
 
05:32:27.048 --> 05:32:27.058 align:start position:0%
board and the broads with a higher speed
 
05:32:29.330 --> 05:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
I can tell I can tell you about a number
 
05:32:30.770 --> 05:32:30.780 align:start position:0%
of places on the lake that should have
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
significantly lower speed limits think
 
05:32:35.570 --> 05:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
about that
 
05:32:39.650 --> 05:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
it isn't just accidents
 
05:32:43.690 --> 05:32:43.700 align:start position:0%
that speed limits control or decrease
 
05:32:47.270 --> 05:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's about near misses it changes the
 
05:32:49.310 --> 05:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
experience on the lake from one of
 
05:32:51.590 --> 05:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat of enjoyment they're looking
 
05:32:53.930 --> 05:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
behind your back like we all do on 93
 
05:32:55.548 --> 05:32:55.558 align:start position:0%
when Speeders go by
 
05:32:58.850 --> 05:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
lastly getting right to the end here I
 
05:33:00.288 --> 05:33:00.298 align:start position:0%
just turned 80 so I'm going to
 
05:33:02.208 --> 05:33:02.218 align:start position:0%
philosophize a little bit I don't know
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
if anybody's heard about the tragedy of
 
05:33:05.868 --> 05:33:05.878 align:start position:0%
the commons
 
05:33:08.510 --> 05:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
tragedy of Commons talks about the use
 
05:33:10.910 --> 05:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
of a common resource where each
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
individual has their priorities unless
 
05:33:15.948 --> 05:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
it's regulated in some way that Commons
 
05:33:17.208 --> 05:33:17.218 align:start position:0%
the worth
 
05:33:20.208 --> 05:33:20.218 align:start position:0%
of that Commons degrades so I think
 
05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing here a good
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
decision was made 13 years ago
 
05:33:26.510 --> 05:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to change it for
 
05:33:28.490 --> 05:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
the benefit of a few who could travel
 
05:33:31.670 --> 05:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
east another hour and go as fast as they
 
05:33:35.510 --> 05:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:38.868 --> 05:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:00.770 --> 05:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:03.410 --> 05:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
sir you said eight minutes but uh please
 
05:34:07.850 --> 05:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:34:11.090 --> 05:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
my name is Richard Smith
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
I am here representing the New Hampshire
 
05:34:16.548 --> 05:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
Bass Federation
 
05:34:18.650 --> 05:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
I was born and raised in South Dakota so
 
05:34:22.970 --> 05:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
that explains why I talk funny
 
05:34:26.090 --> 05:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
but we're mainly into fishing we turn
 
05:34:27.470 --> 05:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
the clock back
 
05:34:30.170 --> 05:34:30.180 align:start position:0%
12 13 years ago when this issue was
 
05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.890 --> 05:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
it wasn't aimed at us
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
we basically want to fish
 
05:34:41.990 --> 05:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to spend a lot of time
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
getting from point A to B to C to D
 
05:34:45.480 --> 05:34:47.030 align:start position:0%
getting from point A to B to C to D
so

05:34:47.030 --> 05:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:51.770 --> 05:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
while it wasn't intended to restrict us
 
05:34:54.708 --> 05:34:54.718 align:start position:0%
it was really aimed at the the big high
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
performance bolts like the formulas the
 
05:35:00.410 --> 05:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
donzies the cigarettes the mountains
 
05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
but it did have a negative impact on us
 
05:35:07.628 --> 05:35:07.638 align:start position:0%
and uh give you a little
 
05:35:11.208 --> 05:35:11.218 align:start position:0%
insights into what this bass fishing
 
05:35:13.010 --> 05:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
stuff is all about
 
05:35:16.610 --> 05:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
the vaults we run are performance bolts
 
05:35:20.570 --> 05:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
they're fishing machines they're built
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
for big water
 
05:35:26.330 --> 05:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
these are some of the safest voters
 
05:35:29.208 --> 05:35:29.218 align:start position:0%
that you're ever going to find
 
05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
when they're up on speed up on pad as
 
05:35:34.850 --> 05:35:34.860 align:start position:0%
they say they make very little wake so
 
05:35:37.610 --> 05:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
that's a big positive
 
05:35:40.368 --> 05:35:40.378 align:start position:0%
most of the bass fishing tournaments you
 
05:35:43.368 --> 05:35:43.378 align:start position:0%
hear about are small clubs
 
05:35:45.470 --> 05:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
so when they have a club tournament on
 
05:35:45.480 --> 05:35:47.650 align:start position:0%
so when they have a club tournament on
Winnipesaukee

05:35:47.650 --> 05:35:47.660 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee
 
05:35:50.330 --> 05:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
there's only like six seven boats that's
 
05:35:53.390 --> 05:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
it 7 A.M how many boats you think around
 
05:35:53.400 --> 05:35:54.650 align:start position:0%
it 7 A.M how many boats you think around
water

05:35:54.650 --> 05:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
water
 
05:35:56.930 --> 05:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
almost none
 
05:35:59.090 --> 05:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
and these bass boats are designed to
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
cover a lot of water typical bass
 
05:36:03.410 --> 05:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
fishermen will travel
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
over 50 miles
 
05:36:07.730 --> 05:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
during the day
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
the whole ideas minimize the amount of
 
05:36:13.610 --> 05:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
time spent traveling Max whoops maximize
 
05:36:16.010 --> 05:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
the amount of time fishing that's what
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're all about
 
05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have talked about safety
 
05:36:20.280 --> 05:36:21.288 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have talked about safety
issues

05:36:21.288 --> 05:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:36:23.690 --> 05:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping Mr chairman
 
05:36:26.690 --> 05:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
that you will call on before forward
 
05:36:30.288 --> 05:36:30.298 align:start position:0%
through today uh Captain Don Levy
 
05:36:33.288 --> 05:36:33.298 align:start position:0%
because he will tell you the objective
 
05:36:33.298 --> 05:36:35.810 align:start position:0%
because he will tell you the objective
facts

05:36:35.810 --> 05:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
facts
 
05:36:39.410 --> 05:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
I know going back to 2007
 
05:36:39.420 --> 05:36:40.910 align:start position:0%
I know going back to 2007
uh

05:36:40.910 --> 05:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
rain Patrol did a
 
05:36:43.440 --> 05:36:45.470 align:start position:0%
rain Patrol did a
study

05:36:45.470 --> 05:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:36:48.590 --> 05:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
on speed they use two different kinds of
 
05:36:53.570 --> 05:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.850 --> 05:36:55.860 align:start position:0%
is during the summer nine different
 
05:36:55.860 --> 05:36:57.708 align:start position:0%
is during the summer nine different
areas

05:36:57.708 --> 05:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
areas
 
05:36:59.350 --> 05:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
05:37:02.448 --> 05:37:02.458 align:start position:0%
three thousand eight hundred and fifty
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
three bolts
 
05:37:07.128 --> 05:37:07.138 align:start position:0%
that were clocked
 
05:37:08.990 --> 05:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
do you know how many of them went over
 
05:37:11.690 --> 05:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
45 miles an hour
 
05:37:13.730 --> 05:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
not many
 
05:37:15.948 --> 05:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
it's fair pack the top speed that they
 
05:37:15.958 --> 05:37:17.330 align:start position:0%
it's fair pack the top speed that they
recorded

05:37:17.330 --> 05:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
05:37:20.810 --> 05:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
was 62 miles an hour that was by three
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
boats three boats
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:29.330 --> 05:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has always been a safe
 
05:37:32.150 --> 05:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
voting State going back then and to this
 
05:37:34.750 --> 05:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
day but I'd like you to ask Captain
 
05:37:37.490 --> 05:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
Dunleavy to verify that
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:37:41.810 --> 05:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
so the other points I was going to make
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
is around the handout so that's going to
 
05:37:46.490 --> 05:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
save a little time so thank you very
 
05:37:46.500 --> 05:37:48.410 align:start position:0%
save a little time so thank you very
much

05:37:48.410 --> 05:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:37:52.970 --> 05:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
quick question please
 
05:37:59.090 --> 05:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative Hill who I can't see
 
05:38:01.310 --> 05:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
right now thank you Mr chairman um my
 
05:38:04.850 --> 05:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
question is uh then go back to your
 
05:38:07.788 --> 05:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
phone to the microphone please
 
05:38:10.730 --> 05:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
um my question is whether the number of
 
05:38:16.490 --> 05:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh bass tournaments has decreased since
 
05:38:21.470 --> 05:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
my general impression this is a voting
 
05:38:26.750 --> 05:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
itself has grown especially over the
 
05:38:28.368 --> 05:38:28.378 align:start position:0%
last few years
 
05:38:28.378 --> 05:38:29.750 align:start position:0%
last few years
uh

05:38:29.750 --> 05:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:38:32.208 --> 05:38:32.218 align:start position:0%
there's been a significant increase in
 
05:38:35.270 --> 05:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
fishing and uh
 
05:38:37.730 --> 05:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
but I would say that the the bass
 
05:38:40.310 --> 05:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
fishing Community is remained pretty
 
05:38:40.320 --> 05:38:41.628 align:start position:0%
fishing Community is remained pretty
stable

05:38:41.628 --> 05:38:41.638 align:start position:0%
stable
 
05:38:43.730 --> 05:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
was that what your question was yes
 
05:38:45.770 --> 05:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to answer any other
 
05:38:50.628 --> 05:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
questions except I think you reveal my
 
05:38:53.330 --> 05:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
best fishing spot thank you with any
 
05:38:56.330 --> 05:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you
 
05:38:56.340 --> 05:39:05.448 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you
okay

05:39:05.448 --> 05:39:05.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:08.030 --> 05:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's Warren Hutchins but I'm not
 
05:39:08.040 --> 05:39:10.368 align:start position:0%
I think it's Warren Hutchins but I'm not
sure

05:39:10.368 --> 05:39:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hutchins is the last name anyway
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
yeah yes it is
 
05:39:17.750 --> 05:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Warren Hutchins a
 
05:39:20.270 --> 05:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
multi-generational New Hampshire native
 
05:39:22.430 --> 05:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I live full-time in Guilford New
 
05:39:24.470 --> 05:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've been an active boater on
 
05:39:26.470 --> 05:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee since
 
05:39:29.750 --> 05:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
1979. my family has grown up on the lake
 
05:39:31.670 --> 05:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
like you I've devoted my time and
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
efforts for the people of New Hampshire
 
05:39:36.590 --> 05:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
I served the 34 communities of the Lakes
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
Region Planning Commission for over a
 
05:39:41.410 --> 05:39:41.420 align:start position:0%
dozen years on its executive committee
 
05:39:44.930 --> 05:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
multiple years as elected chair in this
 
05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
capacity I was very involved with the
 
05:39:49.850 --> 05:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
10-year Transportation plan process
 
05:39:52.368 --> 05:39:52.378 align:start position:0%
it is as you know a ground-up planning
 
05:39:54.170 --> 05:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
process originating with the communities
 
05:39:57.470 --> 05:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
in the state it is primarily focused on
 
05:40:00.170 --> 05:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
Transportation safety then comes
 
05:40:02.990 --> 05:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
capacity then comes economics
 
05:40:05.150 --> 05:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
Transportation safety was grounded into
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
me as I commanded a line hall trucking
 
05:40:10.490 --> 05:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
company in combat in Vietnam
 
05:40:13.070 --> 05:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
over a dozen years ago the lrpc
 
05:40:14.810 --> 05:40:14.820 align:start position:0%
supported speed limits on Lake
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee with testimony before the
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%

discussion concerning the bra

excuse me the brides this is a major
 
05:41:14.990 --> 05:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
part of the lake and is like a major
 
05:41:17.090 --> 05:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
intersection that so many different
 
05:41:19.368 --> 05:41:19.378 align:start position:0%

accidents that have been prevented by
 
05:41:39.948 --> 05:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
the sensible regulation defining speeds
 
05:41:43.070 --> 05:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
as we do on our roads please let your

hi good afternoon I'm here today my name
 
05:42:44.208 --> 05:42:44.218 align:start position:0%
is Jennifer dropsky representing my
 
05:42:45.830 --> 05:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
company Seven Lakes Marine Service as
 
05:42:48.770 --> 05:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
well as myself I'm very much in favor of
 
05:42:50.330 --> 05:42:50.340 align:start position:0%
removing the speed limit on Lake
 
05:42:52.850 --> 05:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee the greatest issue on any
 
05:42:55.610 --> 05:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
lake is the new boat owner driver and or
 
05:42:57.708 --> 05:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
the driver being intoxicated
 
05:42:59.570 --> 05:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
these are the two greatest factors on
 
05:43:01.368 --> 05:43:01.378 align:start position:0%
any Lake for having the risk of greatest
 
05:43:03.708 --> 05:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
injury I know that because we see this
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
damage firsthand
 
05:43:07.730 --> 05:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
as for the speed boats Making Waves the
 
05:43:09.590 --> 05:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
wake of a big Cruiser or wakeboard boat
 
05:43:12.170 --> 05:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
is three to five times greater than that
 
05:43:14.628 --> 05:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
of the boats of other boats on the lake
 
05:43:16.490 --> 05:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's simple physics that the faster a
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
boat with a plating hull goes the less
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
wake it will make
 
05:43:22.730 --> 05:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
these boats are equipped with safety
 
05:43:22.740 --> 05:43:24.288 align:start position:0%
these boats are equipped with safety
equipment

05:43:24.288 --> 05:43:24.298 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
05:43:26.208 --> 05:43:26.218 align:start position:0%
with the alarm placed to wear a safety
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
lanyard and many of these boats being
 
05:43:30.288 --> 05:43:30.298 align:start position:0%
outfitted with a foot throttle which is
 
05:43:32.390 --> 05:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
just like taking your foot off the gas
 
05:43:34.250 --> 05:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
the boats will stop if the driver is
 
05:43:36.410 --> 05:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
ejected the drivers of these boats are
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
experienced drivers as well many of the
 
05:43:40.910 --> 05:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
owners that own boats go in excess of 45
 
05:43:43.010 --> 05:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
miles an hour have a vast boating
 
05:43:45.230 --> 05:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
experience and knowledge on how to
 
05:43:47.810 --> 05:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
operate and handle them very very well
 
05:43:49.850 --> 05:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
some of the owners race some of the
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
owners raise boats professionally my
 
05:43:54.948 --> 05:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
husband as well did who won a couple of
 
05:43:56.750 --> 05:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
World Championships in an outer limits
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
race boat neither he or any of his peers
 
05:44:01.610 --> 05:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
have been in any type of recreational
 
05:44:04.490 --> 05:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
boating is the incident caused by speed
 
05:44:06.350 --> 05:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
the people that are running these boats
 
05:44:08.510 --> 05:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
love and take great pride in what they
 
05:44:11.150 --> 05:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
own they congregate in groups much much
 
05:44:13.430 --> 05:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
the same as people in muscle cars do on
 
05:44:15.410 --> 05:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
a cruise night they want to go home to
 
05:44:18.048 --> 05:44:18.058 align:start position:0%
their families at night too so Contra
 
05:44:19.970 --> 05:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
contrary to what we've heard these guys
 
05:44:22.430 --> 05:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
have families too
 
05:44:24.470 --> 05:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
they would never jeopardize that they
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
just want to go out and do what they
 
05:44:25.798 --> 05:44:26.570 align:start position:0%
just want to go out and do what they
love

05:44:26.570 --> 05:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
love
 
05:44:28.190 --> 05:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
please review the speed limit on Lake
 
05:44:30.530 --> 05:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee it does not make sense for
 
05:44:31.970 --> 05:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
any of the arguments that I have seen
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
today and let's restore Live Free or Die
 
05:44:38.270 --> 05:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:40.368 --> 05:44:40.378 align:start position:0%
can we have that did you already hand in
 
05:44:42.770 --> 05:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
some written testimony no yep never mind
 
05:44:47.090 --> 05:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:47.100 --> 05:44:49.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:44:49.610 --> 05:44:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:59.448 --> 05:44:59.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:03.288 --> 05:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
next up is Nancy Watson
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
said four minutes I would enjoy for
 
05:45:08.208 --> 05:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
three minutes
 
05:45:10.128 --> 05:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
especially if you have written testimony
 
05:45:11.930 --> 05:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
then you can just summarize what you
 
05:45:26.690 --> 05:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:28.850 --> 05:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for your time
 
05:45:31.610 --> 05:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
today my name is Nancy Watson and I'm
 
05:45:33.650 --> 05:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
from Eaton I've been boating on Lake
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee for 40 years my husband
 
05:45:38.448 --> 05:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
and I own our home on Rattlesnake Island
 
05:45:42.708 --> 05:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
located on the broads for 35 years we've
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
had to travel through the broads to get
 
05:45:45.410 --> 05:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
to our home
 
05:45:48.048 --> 05:45:48.058 align:start position:0%
I oppose abolishing the daytime boat
 
05:45:49.730 --> 05:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
speed limit and any amendments that
 
05:45:51.470 --> 05:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
would designate the broads as a speed
 
05:45:53.448 --> 05:45:53.458 align:start position:0%
limit exempt area
 
05:45:55.610 --> 05:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
limit in effect for the last 13 years
 
05:45:55.620 --> 05:45:57.110 align:start position:0%
limit in effect for the last 13 years
works

05:45:57.110 --> 05:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
works
 
05:45:59.510 --> 05:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
my home is situated on a cent of 60
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
steps up from the dock this affords me a
 
05:46:05.690 --> 05:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
very elevated view of the broads on busy
 
05:46:07.490 --> 05:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
days especially weekends and holidays
 
05:46:09.110 --> 05:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's a huge volume of traffic
 
05:46:10.910 --> 05:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
traveling up and down the lake and
 
05:46:13.368 --> 05:46:13.378 align:start position:0%
crisscrossing this area before the boat
 
05:46:15.650 --> 05:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
speed limit I witnessed boats traveling
 
05:46:17.930 --> 05:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
at high speeds in One Direction often
 
05:46:20.570 --> 05:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
impacts even a half a dozen weaving
 
05:46:22.128 --> 05:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
around slower traffic
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
just like clockwork about 10 minutes
 
05:46:26.810 --> 05:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
later these same boats often returned
 
05:46:28.730 --> 05:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
heading in the opposite direction in the
 
05:46:30.048 --> 05:46:30.058 align:start position:0%
same manner
 
05:46:31.850 --> 05:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
observing the action of even one
 
05:46:33.770 --> 05:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
high-speed boat among those traveling
 
05:46:37.250 --> 05:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
slower evokes disruption anxiety and
 
05:46:40.010 --> 05:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
fear since the boat speed limit has been
 
05:46:41.810 --> 05:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
in effect these worries have been
 
05:46:44.330 --> 05:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
greatly reduced I see more fishing boats
 
05:46:46.368 --> 05:46:46.378 align:start position:0%
trolling more kayaks more paddle
 
05:46:48.110 --> 05:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
boarders venturing further out in the
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
broads and more boaters swimming off
 
05:46:51.590 --> 05:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
their boats and drifting on a beautiful
 
05:46:51.600 --> 05:46:52.610 align:start position:0%
their boats and drifting on a beautiful
day

05:46:52.610 --> 05:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
for an evening to watch the sunset
 
05:46:57.530 --> 05:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
and you've all heard already since
 
05:47:00.048 --> 05:47:00.058 align:start position:0%
what's happened since covet hit
 
05:47:02.030 --> 05:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
people are seeking new forms of
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
recreation and many of them are new and
 
05:47:06.288 --> 05:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
inexperienced boaters voter education
 
05:47:09.170 --> 05:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
does not equate to experience its
 
05:47:10.448 --> 05:47:10.458 align:start position:0%
practice practice
 
05:47:12.890 --> 05:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
when I pull into the marina from where I
 
05:47:15.410 --> 05:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
Boke the parking lot is full this was
 
05:47:17.570 --> 05:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
once reserved for weekends and holidays
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
but now it's all week long it's mostly
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
from start to the end of the season and
 
05:47:25.490 --> 05:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
I've been at this Marina for 24 years
 
05:47:27.350 --> 05:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
more people are using the lake which
 
05:47:29.390 --> 05:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
translates into more boats if you've
 
05:47:31.250 --> 05:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
ever driven a boat especially on a busy
 
05:47:33.170 --> 05:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
day you understand you need to stay
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
focused on the boats that are heading
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
towards you the ones to the right the
 
05:47:39.190 --> 05:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
ones to the left the ones behind you
 
05:47:41.150 --> 05:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
they're coming from all different
 
05:47:43.070 --> 05:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
directions and they're all traveling at
 
05:47:45.948 --> 05:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
different speeds I can't tell you how
 
05:47:47.690 --> 05:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
many times I've looked in back of me
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
only a moment later there's nobody there
 
05:47:52.910 --> 05:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
and then somebody passes me from behind
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
and that 150 foot rule I mean uh good
 
05:47:58.310 --> 05:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
luck it's really hard to do that when
 
05:47:59.750 --> 05:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
you you're it's a busy weekend and
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of boats that are out
 
05:48:02.150 --> 05:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
there buzzing around from every
 
05:48:02.160 --> 05:48:03.830 align:start position:0%
there buzzing around from every
direction

05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:48:05.690 --> 05:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
um it's a good idea it's a good concept
 
05:48:07.730 --> 05:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
you know it means it means it's business
 
05:48:10.250 --> 05:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
but there are rules and that there's not
 
05:48:11.930 --> 05:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
one person in this room who hasn't
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
experience being cut off or I'm forced
 
05:48:16.970 --> 05:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
to divert around another boat that's
 
05:48:19.010 --> 05:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
passing on the incorrect side we've all
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
been there
 
05:48:22.730 --> 05:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
there's no Lanes on the lake and there's
 
05:48:24.230 --> 05:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
no breaks on a boat
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
the enactment of the speed limit has
 
05:48:28.670 --> 05:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
provided everybody time to slow down
 
05:48:31.610 --> 05:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
which that has probably saved a personal
 
05:48:34.250 --> 05:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
property or maybe even a life
 
05:48:36.770 --> 05:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
if the broads is designated the no speed
 
05:48:38.810 --> 05:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
limit Zone where will the boundary
 
05:48:40.730 --> 05:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
markers be placed and who's going to
 
05:48:42.410 --> 05:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
maintain them you know they do move
 
05:48:45.410 --> 05:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
around due to the weather do you expect
 
05:48:47.628 --> 05:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol to do this and to also
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
monitor the boundary mean Patrol
 
05:48:51.470 --> 05:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
frequents the broads much less than
 
05:48:53.330 --> 05:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
before their personnel is stretched
 
05:48:55.310 --> 05:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
pretty thin right now and humans are
 
05:48:58.490 --> 05:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
humans we all make mistakes the faster
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
you go the faster you've got to think
 
05:49:02.570 --> 05:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
I've seen more than my share of bizarre
 
05:49:03.948 --> 05:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunate happenings on the broad
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
including a drowning ejected and pinned
 
05:49:08.570 --> 05:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
passengers from an out of controlled
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
airboat and an overloaded sunken boat in
 
05:49:13.490 --> 05:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
its recovery I've assisted the victim of
 
05:49:15.530 --> 05:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
a plane crash there's a lot of crazy
 
05:49:17.208 --> 05:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
things that happen on the broads and
 
05:49:19.670 --> 05:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
increasing the risk of more mishaps by
 
05:49:21.410 --> 05:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
adding speed limit to the equation is
 
05:49:23.810 --> 05:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
not a wise choice doing where the speed
 
05:49:25.490 --> 05:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
lets at this time when the lake
 
05:49:27.048 --> 05:49:27.058 align:start position:0%
especially the broads experience an
 
05:49:28.610 --> 05:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
increase in traffic is not a common
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
sense good judgment decision I asked the
 
05:49:35.330 --> 05:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
committee to itl HB 1424 so all can
 
05:49:37.128 --> 05:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
equally enjoy Lake Winnipesaukee and
 
05:49:39.350 --> 05:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
feel safe thank you thank you any
 
05:49:39.360 --> 05:49:43.368 align:start position:0%
feel safe thank you thank you any
questions

05:49:43.368 --> 05:49:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:48.590 --> 05:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming Mr Watson that you have
 
05:49:52.910 --> 05:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same testimony as your
 
05:49:55.850 --> 05:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
wife so you could perhaps summarize what
 
05:49:58.128 --> 05:49:58.138 align:start position:0%
both of you have
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
I understand that but it interests at
 
05:50:00.958 --> 05:50:04.548 align:start position:0%
I understand that but it interests at
times

05:50:04.548 --> 05:50:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.730 --> 05:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh yes my name is Mark Watson and I'm
 
05:50:09.470 --> 05:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
from the same house as my wife in Eaton
 
05:50:13.850 --> 05:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to oppose HB 1424 being on
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
Rattlesnake Island for the past 35 years
 
05:50:18.230 --> 05:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
with an unobstructed view of the broads
 
05:50:20.990 --> 05:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
I've written firsthand boat traffic
 
05:50:23.628 --> 05:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
before and after the speed limits before
 
05:50:25.910 --> 05:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
the speed limits I witness on many
 
05:50:28.250 --> 05:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
occasions one-on-one racing not to
 
05:50:31.548 --> 05:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
mention four five across boat racing
 
05:50:33.708 --> 05:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
since the implementation of the speed
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
limit that soda racing has vanished
 
05:50:40.270 --> 05:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
thankfully the second pattern I see
 
05:50:43.490 --> 05:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh both pre and post
 
05:50:45.770 --> 05:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
speed limits is
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
the boater that goes up and down the
 
05:50:51.470 --> 05:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
lake repeatedly over and over again
 
05:50:54.530 --> 05:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
it takes my calculations 10 minutes 40
 
05:50:56.390 --> 05:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
seconds to do the entire length of the
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
broads from north to south that means in
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
one hour I can make six trips
 
05:51:04.490 --> 05:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
how much faster do I need to go and
 
05:51:06.650 --> 05:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
where else can I go
 
05:51:08.628 --> 05:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
the lake isn't large enough to
 
05:51:11.448 --> 05:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
accommodate unrestricted speeds without
 
05:51:13.070 --> 05:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
endangering or intimidating other
 
05:51:15.288 --> 05:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
boaters and swimmers that is why the
 
05:51:17.390 --> 05:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
speed limit law was put in fact in the
 
05:51:18.410 --> 05:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
first place
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
I crossed the broads quite often from my
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
Mainland dock in woofboro to my
 
05:51:24.530 --> 05:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
Rattlesnake Island home I have an
 
05:51:27.350 --> 05:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
observed at either a single lit or unlit
 
05:51:30.048 --> 05:51:30.058 align:start position:0%
buoy the delineating where the broads
 
05:51:31.788 --> 05:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
begin or ends
 
05:51:33.230 --> 05:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
because of the broad's hub-like
 
05:51:35.330 --> 05:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
geography traveling from any of
 
05:51:38.208 --> 05:51:38.218 align:start position:0%
wolfeboro's five major Bays requires
 
05:51:40.850 --> 05:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
a large amount creates a large amount of
 
05:51:42.770 --> 05:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
crisscoffing traffic by increasing
 
05:51:44.750 --> 05:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
speeds in the broads you require boaters
 
05:51:46.788 --> 05:51:46.798 align:start position:0%
to make quicker decision on who has the
 
05:51:48.530 --> 05:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
right-of-way and the safest way to
 
05:51:50.930 --> 05:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
proceed all boaters in one vicinity
 
05:51:52.970 --> 05:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
process what is happening and what may
 
05:51:55.070 --> 05:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
happen next having a single boat
 
05:51:56.510 --> 05:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
traveling at a much higher speed
 
05:51:58.490 --> 05:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
intensifies the action and reaction
 
05:52:01.128 --> 05:52:01.138 align:start position:0%
others must make make
 
05:52:03.048 --> 05:52:03.058 align:start position:0%
Philly currently has a speed limit in
 
05:52:04.730 --> 05:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
place that maintains an equal and safe
 
05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
blame people of
 
05:52:08.510 --> 05:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
a playing field please don't destroy
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
something that works
 
05:52:12.048 --> 05:52:12.058 align:start position:0%
why would anybody want to do it with the
 
05:52:14.390 --> 05:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
speed limits the only answer can be they
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
want to go faster
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
since uh there really isn't any place to
 
05:52:21.170 --> 05:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
go except up and down the broads the
 
05:52:24.048 --> 05:52:24.058 align:start position:0%
next question becomes how fast can I go
 
05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
and is my boat faster than yours
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I believe this will bring
 
05:52:32.270 --> 05:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
us back to free speed limit racing
 
05:52:32.280 --> 05:52:34.448 align:start position:0%
us back to free speed limit racing
foreign

05:52:34.448 --> 05:52:34.458 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:52:37.690 --> 05:52:37.700 align:start position:0%
racing I saw Surfers
 
05:52:39.770 --> 05:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
windsurfers kayakers and other small
 
05:52:41.628 --> 05:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
craft having to make way
 
05:52:43.730 --> 05:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
for boats bearing down out of them at
 
05:52:44.930 --> 05:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
high speeds
 
05:52:46.910 --> 05:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
paddle boarders and jet skis have become
 
05:52:49.070 --> 05:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
much more commonplace on the broad since
 
05:52:51.530 --> 05:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
speed limits were imposed at times the
 
05:52:53.390 --> 05:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
broad can become quite busy with smaller
 
05:52:56.390 --> 05:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
watercraft his Insanity to consider
 
05:52:59.810 --> 05:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
increasing boat speeds in summary speed
 
05:53:01.310 --> 05:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
limits have helped improve the Lake's
 
05:53:03.530 --> 05:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
boating experience for many there are
 
05:53:05.330 --> 05:53:05.340 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Watson any questions

05:53:47.330 --> 05:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
good afternoon how you doing I'm here
 
05:53:49.128 --> 05:53:49.138 align:start position:0%
for the bill
 
05:53:51.350 --> 05:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah this lake has a lot of Powerball
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
history it has the first ever sanctioned
 
05:53:56.570 --> 05:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
speed race held on a body of water in
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
the United States we've had wooden boats
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
in the 1930s taking people for rides at
 
05:54:03.830 --> 05:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
60 and 70 miles an hour much more than
 
05:54:05.090 --> 05:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
today's speed limit where boats are
 
05:54:08.510 --> 05:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
45 we need to compromise here the lake
 
05:54:13.070 --> 05:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
is big enough for everybody and I feel
 
05:54:14.810 --> 05:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
like at least today we should find a
 
05:54:17.690 --> 05:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
compromiser eventually you know we share
 
05:54:19.788 --> 05:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
the same speed limit as a snowmobile on
 
05:54:22.730 --> 05:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
a trail that is six feet wide the same
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
exact speed of 45.
 
05:54:28.250 --> 05:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
boats are much more safer in a much wide
 
05:54:29.690 --> 05:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
open space
 
05:54:31.730 --> 05:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
it's again the lakes for everybody to
 
05:54:33.770 --> 05:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
enjoy and I feel like we're we're a very
 
05:54:35.208 --> 05:54:35.218 align:start position:0%
small percent of people out there
 
05:54:36.890 --> 05:54:36.900 align:start position:0%
enjoying boats that might go faster than
 
05:54:36.900 --> 05:54:37.910 align:start position:0%
enjoying boats that might go faster than
that

05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:39.890 --> 05:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
um you know you plug one of these boats
 
05:54:41.750 --> 05:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
in a computer because everything today
 
05:54:44.570 --> 05:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
is computerized at higher throttle
 
05:54:44.580 --> 05:54:45.590 align:start position:0%
is computerized at higher throttle
levels

05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
levels
 
05:54:47.930 --> 05:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
out of 300 hours on a boat you have six
 
05:54:49.970 --> 05:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
percent at Full Throttle
 
05:54:51.470 --> 05:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
if this speed limit changes we're not
 
05:54:54.708 --> 05:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
out there all day doing this but you
 
05:54:56.270 --> 05:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
know our Lake can roll with five six
 
05:54:58.190 --> 05:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
foot waves bigger boats can get places
 
05:55:00.350 --> 05:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
when nobody else is out there much safer
 
05:55:04.548 --> 05:55:04.558 align:start position:0%
and you do have to go at 45 55 65 to get
 
05:55:06.170 --> 05:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
up on top of the waves to be safer
 
05:55:06.180 --> 05:55:07.490 align:start position:0%
up on top of the waves to be safer
moving

05:55:07.490 --> 05:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
moving
 
05:55:07.500 --> 05:55:08.208 align:start position:0%
moving
um

05:55:08.208 --> 05:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:10.368 --> 05:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
so again just some of those facts I've
 
05:55:12.350 --> 05:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
been doing this uh our families about
 
05:55:14.628 --> 05:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
Lake since 1972. I've been boating all
 
05:55:17.330 --> 05:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
43 years of my life I representing a lot
 
05:55:18.650 --> 05:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
of working people that can't be here
 
05:55:20.628 --> 05:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
today friends family people retired in
 
05:55:23.750 --> 05:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
Florida and uh there's much more of us
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
that couldn't be here saying the same
 
05:55:27.650 --> 05:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
thing as me thank you
 
05:55:30.590 --> 05:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
05:55:44.990 --> 05:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:45.000 --> 05:55:47.868 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:55:47.868 --> 05:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:51.048 --> 05:55:51.058 align:start position:0%
Mary strobber
 
05:55:53.890 --> 05:55:53.900 align:start position:0%
marks right
 
05:55:56.990 --> 05:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
show us how well I print
 
05:55:59.990 --> 05:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't need either good afternoon my name
 
05:56:01.910 --> 05:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
is Mark Straubel and I serve as the
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
associate executive director for the
 
05:56:05.628 --> 05:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
YMCA Greater Boston overnight camps and
 
05:56:07.250 --> 05:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
we operate three camps on Lake
 
05:56:09.530 --> 05:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee Northwoods Pleasant Valley
 
05:56:12.708 --> 05:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
and our Sandy Island Family Camp our
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
Sandy Island Family Camp is a 66 acre
 
05:56:18.948 --> 05:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
Island adjacent to the broads and we
 
05:56:21.590 --> 05:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
have children and families of all ages
 
05:56:23.810 --> 05:56:23.820 align:start position:0%
to participate on a daily basis out in a
 
05:56:26.208 --> 05:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
lot of watercraft all around the island
 
05:56:28.310 --> 05:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
and we've been operating that camp for
 
05:56:31.430 --> 05:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
over 100 years and we have seen all
 
05:56:34.310 --> 05:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
kinds of challenges with boating
 
05:56:37.010 --> 05:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and we are not
 
05:56:40.190 --> 05:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
um in favor of this bill we believe that
 
05:56:42.530 --> 05:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
the current 45 mile an hour and 30 mile
 
05:56:45.048 --> 05:56:45.058 align:start position:0%
an hour is common sense and appropriate
 
05:56:47.330 --> 05:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
to have those limitations and I will
 
05:56:49.368 --> 05:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
yield the rest of my time
 
05:56:54.530 --> 05:56:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:57.410 --> 05:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:59.448 --> 05:56:59.458 align:start position:0%
next up is Jeff
 
05:57:07.368 --> 05:57:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
I like the three-minute rule
 
05:57:16.010 --> 05:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:22.730 --> 05:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:24.650 --> 05:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
05:57:26.330 --> 05:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
05:57:29.208 --> 05:57:29.218 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 1424 is
 
05:57:31.548 --> 05:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
written my name is Jeff Keeler I'm a
 
05:57:33.230 --> 05:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
lifelong resident of Epsom New Hampshire
 
05:57:35.448 --> 05:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
and has spent portions of the summer at
 
05:57:37.788 --> 05:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee for the last 66 years
 
05:57:40.250 --> 05:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm currently a property owner in Bear
 
05:57:42.170 --> 05:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
Island and have witnessed the tremendous
 
05:57:44.150 --> 05:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
growth of activity on the lake that has
 
05:57:46.548 --> 05:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
come with the inevitable development of
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
it my family and I enjoy fishing
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
canoeing kayaking and sailing on the
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
lake but have found that Crossing from
 
05:57:55.310 --> 05:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
East bear Island to five and six miles
 
05:57:57.590 --> 05:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
Islands in these slower moving vessels
 
05:58:00.530 --> 05:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
has become unsafe at times other than
 
05:58:02.690 --> 05:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
Daybreak when boat activity is at the
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
lowest level and point yes I do own
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
power votes and pay registration fees as
 
05:58:07.798 --> 05:58:09.070 align:start position:0%
power votes and pay registration fees as
well

05:58:09.070 --> 05:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:58:11.570 --> 05:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
we recognize that we have little
 
05:58:13.250 --> 05:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
maneuverability in these small
 
05:58:15.410 --> 05:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
slow-moving vessels and we have right
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
life jackets and use brightly colored
 
05:58:19.330 --> 05:58:19.340 align:start position:0%
paddles to provide the greatest
 
05:58:22.850 --> 05:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
visibility to oncoming vessels despite
 
05:58:24.948 --> 05:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
our precautions these activities have
 
05:58:27.470 --> 05:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
resulted in some very close calls when
 
05:58:29.570 --> 05:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
inattentive drivers driving at high
 
05:58:31.490 --> 05:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
speeds have come very close to hitting
 
05:58:31.500 --> 05:58:32.270 align:start position:0%
speeds have come very close to hitting
us

05:58:32.270 --> 05:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
I lost one neighbor several years ago to
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
a boat accident in Meredith Bay when a
 
05:58:39.650 --> 05:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
high-powered boat accelerating to get on
 
05:58:41.628 --> 05:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
plane ran their boat over from behind
 
05:58:44.270 --> 05:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
killing him instantly and injuring his
 
05:58:46.430 --> 05:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
wife and children another Island
 
05:58:50.330 --> 05:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
neighbor son was newly killed at about
 
05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
the same time when a boat traveling at
 
05:58:54.410 --> 05:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
high rated speed on a rainy day drove
 
05:58:56.270 --> 05:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
through the side of their boat causing
 
05:58:58.970 --> 05:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
Serious injury to both of the occupants
 
05:59:00.890 --> 05:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
there's a reason that we have speed
 
05:59:03.350 --> 05:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
limits on our highways it is simply
 
05:59:05.690 --> 05:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
unsafe to allow Vehicles capable of
 
05:59:07.868 --> 05:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
traveling at excessive speeds to do so
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
the same holds true for travel on the
 
05:59:13.250 --> 05:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
big lake boats unlike cars are not
 
05:59:15.470 --> 05:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
traveling in designated lanes and as
 
05:59:17.570 --> 05:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
such the safety approach voters is
 
05:59:20.270 --> 05:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
subject to constant scrutiny of others
 
05:59:22.070 --> 05:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the area to provide for reasonable
 
05:59:24.830 --> 05:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
options in avoiding collisions
 
05:59:27.410 --> 05:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
clearly if we to provide opportunity for
 
05:59:29.510 --> 05:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
everyone to use this state resource
 
05:59:32.810 --> 05:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
safely and enjoyably it is imperative
 
05:59:34.810 --> 05:59:34.820 align:start position:0%
that we control speeds to avoid
 
05:59:38.208 --> 05:59:38.218 align:start position:0%
unnecessary injuries and deaths I just
 
05:59:40.070 --> 05:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
make one final Point people are talking
 
05:59:42.048 --> 05:59:42.058 align:start position:0%
about the need to get from point A to
 
05:59:44.690 --> 05:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
point B if you do the math to go from
 
05:59:47.030 --> 05:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
Center Harbor to Alton Bay which is
 
05:59:49.670 --> 05:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 26 miles at the current
 
05:59:52.010 --> 05:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
speed limit of 45 you make it in 35
 
05:59:54.350 --> 05:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
minutes that's fast enough
 
05:59:55.490 --> 05:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:59:58.850 --> 05:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions for Witness
 
06:00:05.930 --> 06:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:07.570 --> 06:00:07.580 align:start position:0%
they can understand
 
06:00:11.090 --> 06:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
next up is Michael Dempsey
 
06:00:11.100 --> 06:00:18.048 align:start position:0%
next up is Michael Dempsey
okay

06:00:18.048 --> 06:00:18.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:22.548 --> 06:00:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you committee
 
06:00:25.548 --> 06:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of lifting the speed
 
06:00:25.558 --> 06:00:26.890 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of lifting the speed
limit

06:00:26.890 --> 06:00:26.900 align:start position:0%
limit
 
06:00:30.470 --> 06:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
hb1424 I own a
 
06:00:32.690 --> 06:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
high-speed powerboat
 
06:00:34.310 --> 06:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:00:35.990 --> 06:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm all about
 
06:00:39.470 --> 06:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
a common sense solution to this
 
06:00:42.110 --> 06:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
I understand there's been problems in
 
06:00:45.530 --> 06:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
the past with a lot of people
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know bring up a lot of other things
 
06:00:50.208 --> 06:00:50.218 align:start position:0%
the 150 foot rule and
 
06:00:52.250 --> 06:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
accidents that happen because of alcohol
 
06:00:55.548 --> 06:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
or driving at night
 
06:00:55.558 --> 06:00:56.690 align:start position:0%
or driving at night
um

06:00:56.690 --> 06:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:58.490 --> 06:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
06:01:00.830 --> 06:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
everyone enjoying the lake
 
06:01:03.288 --> 06:01:03.298 align:start position:0%
I love looking at loons I love the
 
06:01:03.298 --> 06:01:04.970 align:start position:0%
I love looking at loons I love the
wildlife

06:01:04.970 --> 06:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
you know I'll get out on a kayak once in
 
06:01:08.810 --> 06:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
a while I'm not a big fan but you know
 
06:01:10.490 --> 06:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
we can all
 
06:01:14.090 --> 06:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
enjoy the lake in our own way
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I think the Marine Patrol could
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
look at people on the broads and saying
 
06:01:24.410 --> 06:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know you're operating unsafe even if
 
06:01:27.770 --> 06:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a speed limit if it's a clear
 
06:01:30.410 --> 06:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
day and you're not within
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
any boat within sight
 
06:01:36.048 --> 06:01:36.058 align:start position:0%
I don't see why you can't go over 45
 
06:01:38.570 --> 06:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
miles an hour
 
06:01:38.580 --> 06:01:39.948 align:start position:0%
miles an hour
um

06:01:39.948 --> 06:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:42.530 --> 06:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
I don't go too fast too often because
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
every time I do I break something so you
 
06:01:47.448 --> 06:01:47.458 align:start position:0%
know I I just think if I'm out in the
 
06:01:49.788 --> 06:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
middle of the broads
 
06:01:52.970 --> 06:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
I can pull anchor and or not even just
 
06:01:54.650 --> 06:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
float around and look around there isn't
 
06:01:57.350 --> 06:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
a boat for like miles
 
06:01:57.360 --> 06:01:58.670 align:start position:0%
a boat for like miles
and

06:01:58.670 --> 06:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:00.788 --> 06:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's about a daytime
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
compromise and I'm all about the
 
06:02:06.288 --> 06:02:06.298 align:start position:0%
nighttime speed limit because
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
you can't see at night and that that's
 
06:02:10.310 --> 06:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
06:02:13.850 --> 06:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
you know we have sound ordinances which
 
06:02:16.250 --> 06:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
quieted the boats down and I get that
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's common sense I respect that but
 
06:02:22.070 --> 06:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
if there could be a common sense
 
06:02:25.250 --> 06:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
compromise that's all we're asking today
 
06:02:28.368 --> 06:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
and uh I appreciate you hearing us and
 
06:02:30.830 --> 06:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
like a lot of these guys said
 
06:02:33.650 --> 06:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
this is part of the lake I I moved here
 
06:02:36.410 --> 06:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
from Mass in 86 and I remember coming to
 
06:02:38.570 --> 06:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
the Weirs and looking at all the big
 
06:02:41.750 --> 06:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
votes going oh you know that's so cool
 
06:02:44.330 --> 06:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
you know and that's what Winnipesaukee
 
06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
used to be and I understand sometimes
 
06:02:50.270 --> 06:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:02:51.708 --> 06:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
I don't know where I'm going with that
 
06:02:53.810 --> 06:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
but that those days are never coming
 
06:02:56.288 --> 06:02:56.298 align:start position:0%
back and I'm fine with that but a
 
06:02:58.490 --> 06:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
compromise where we could all get along
 
06:03:00.590 --> 06:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
is all we ask
 
06:03:01.850 --> 06:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:03:05.150 --> 06:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:07.430 --> 06:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
no questions
 
06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:28.548 --> 06:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:30.590 --> 06:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Stephen
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
Spalding I live in the Hollis and
 
06:03:33.120 --> 06:03:35.150 align:start position:0%
Spalding I live in the Hollis and
moultonborough

06:03:35.150 --> 06:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
moultonborough
 
06:03:39.470 --> 06:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
I oppose this bill for reasons of safety
 
06:03:42.288 --> 06:03:42.298 align:start position:0%
I oppose it also for the following
 
06:03:42.298 --> 06:03:44.750 align:start position:0%
I oppose it also for the following
reasons

06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
06:03:46.430 --> 06:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
more speed
 
06:03:49.670 --> 06:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
means more fossil fuel consumption
 
06:03:52.190 --> 06:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
which means more pollution and more
 
06:03:54.410 --> 06:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
06:04:01.368 --> 06:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:06.410 --> 06:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:10.250 --> 06:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
more pollution more noise and less
 
06:04:10.260 --> 06:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
more pollution more noise and less
wildlife

06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
06:04:16.070 --> 06:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
means a diminished natural treasure
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
let us protect and Preserve
 
06:04:22.128 --> 06:04:22.138 align:start position:0%
that with which we are blessed
 
06:04:24.048 --> 06:04:24.058 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:04:25.610 --> 06:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
06:04:25.620 --> 06:04:26.868 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
committee

06:04:26.868 --> 06:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:04:33.890 --> 06:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:44.448 --> 06:04:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:46.670 --> 06:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
06:04:49.490 --> 06:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Jake Paul
 
06:04:51.650 --> 06:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
okay we got through Richard Spaldings
 
06:04:55.490 --> 06:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
this one is from Newcastle oh wait
 
06:04:58.010 --> 06:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm Richard I don't you must have
 
06:04:58.020 --> 06:04:59.510 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm Richard I don't you must have
already

06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:05:01.310 --> 06:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
somebody else came up before earlier
 
06:05:03.350 --> 06:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
didn't you come up earlier Richard
 
06:05:06.890 --> 06:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
Spaulding Newcastle that's you that's I
 
06:05:10.010 --> 06:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
yes and Richard's falling from where I'm
 
06:05:14.510 --> 06:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
Richard Poulet b-o-u no you're you're uh
 
06:05:16.310 --> 06:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I thought we had two
 
06:05:18.770 --> 06:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
Richard spauldings here okay go ahead
 
06:05:18.780 --> 06:05:19.548 align:start position:0%
Richard spauldings here okay go ahead
sir

06:05:19.548 --> 06:05:19.558 align:start position:0%
sir
 
06:05:21.350 --> 06:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm Richard
 
06:05:23.810 --> 06:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
Spaulding from Newcastle and
 
06:05:23.820 --> 06:05:25.190 align:start position:0%
Spaulding from Newcastle and
moultonborough

06:05:25.190 --> 06:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
moultonborough
 
06:05:29.270 --> 06:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to address the 150
 
06:05:32.628 --> 06:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
foot rule which I think is a key factor
 
06:05:37.128 --> 06:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
in some of the presentations here
 
06:05:40.190 --> 06:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's been in effect for a long time I
 
06:05:41.750 --> 06:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how long
 
06:05:46.430 --> 06:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's a very sensible regulation
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and it clearly
 
06:05:54.250 --> 06:05:54.260 align:start position:0%
is established to call for no high speed
 
06:05:58.310 --> 06:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
within 150 feet of a raft of the shore
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
of another boat whether it's a kayak or
 
06:06:03.970 --> 06:06:03.980 align:start position:0%
a yacht
 
06:06:03.980 --> 06:06:05.570 align:start position:0%
a yacht
and

06:06:05.570 --> 06:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:09.948 --> 06:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
it is observed most of the time
 
06:06:12.110 --> 06:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you from first-hand
 
06:06:15.470 --> 06:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
experience in a kayak in this on a stunt
 
06:06:15.480 --> 06:06:16.310 align:start position:0%
experience in a kayak in this on a stunt
fish

06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
fish
 
06:06:19.610 --> 06:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
in this gift on a Wrath
 
06:06:22.490 --> 06:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
frequently it is not observed
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
and when another boat comes at 30 or 40
 
06:06:29.390 --> 06:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
miles an hour close to you
 
06:06:31.788 --> 06:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
if you're about to tack in a sailboat or
 
06:06:35.510 --> 06:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it is not a comfortable or safe
 
06:06:35.520 --> 06:06:37.368 align:start position:0%
whatever it is not a comfortable or safe
situation

06:06:37.368 --> 06:06:37.378 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:06:41.090 --> 06:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
to have those occasional times when it's
 
06:06:42.530 --> 06:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
not observed
 
06:06:46.430 --> 06:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
meaning a boat could be coming 45
 
06:06:50.628 --> 06:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
over 45 who knows how fast is just going
 
06:06:53.208 --> 06:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
to make that risk
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
that much greater and entirely go
 
06:07:00.110 --> 06:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
counter to the purpose of the 150 foot
 
06:07:00.120 --> 06:07:01.310 align:start position:0%
counter to the purpose of the 150 foot
group

06:07:01.310 --> 06:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
group
 
06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's all I wanted to emphasize because
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
I think it's a critical factor in
 
06:07:10.070 --> 06:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on on the lake
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
thanks a lot
 
06:07:13.010 --> 06:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
06:07:15.470 --> 06:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
06:07:19.128 --> 06:07:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:19.138 --> 06:07:20.810 align:start position:0%
 
now

06:07:20.810 --> 06:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:07:26.208 --> 06:07:26.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Dick boulay and
 
06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
I represent the firm of Denny and bullet
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
this afternoon I did not plan to testify
 
06:07:38.510 --> 06:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm very concerned that the prime
 
06:07:40.610 --> 06:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
sponsor by the way I'm opposed to the
 
06:07:42.650 --> 06:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
bill the pine supports in the beginning
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the hearing said that he had an
 
06:07:45.120 --> 06:07:46.670 align:start position:0%
of the hearing said that he had an
amendment

06:07:46.670 --> 06:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:07:48.890 --> 06:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
where is the amendment we've been
 
06:07:51.590 --> 06:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the bronze I mean is there
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
another is there an amendment before us
 
06:07:56.510 --> 06:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:58.788 --> 06:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
I didn't see any Amendment okay I just
 
06:08:00.288 --> 06:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that there was there
 
06:08:02.750 --> 06:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't an amendment but we have not
 
06:08:05.330 --> 06:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
talked about the definition of the
 
06:08:05.340 --> 06:08:06.410 align:start position:0%
talked about the definition of the
bronze

06:08:06.410 --> 06:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
bronze
 
06:08:09.470 --> 06:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
what is the bronze exactly I think I
 
06:08:12.890 --> 06:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
know but do we all know what it is how
 
06:08:16.070 --> 06:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
do we measure it how do we enforce it
 
06:08:18.470 --> 06:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
how much is it going to cost
 
06:08:20.628 --> 06:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
to do that if you're going to put buoys
 
06:08:23.208 --> 06:08:23.218 align:start position:0%
up too so people know they're in the
 
06:08:25.010 --> 06:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
bronze I think there's too many
 
06:08:27.890 --> 06:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions just on that alone
 
06:08:30.350 --> 06:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
I think the bill should be defeated
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
it'll be glad to answer any questions
 
06:08:36.830 --> 06:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:39.350 --> 06:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:08:42.070 --> 06:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
as anyone
 
06:08:44.990 --> 06:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to speak who has
 
06:08:47.868 --> 06:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
not had the chance to speak on this
 
06:08:47.878 --> 06:08:52.368 align:start position:0%
not had the chance to speak on this
subject

06:08:52.368 --> 06:08:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
you you've already you you you've
 
06:09:00.410 --> 06:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:10.090 --> 06:09:10.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:13.128 --> 06:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
I'll bring this up in a moment thank you
 
06:09:15.708 --> 06:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
all right sir good afternoon Mr chairman
 
06:09:17.930 --> 06:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
my name is Tim Dunleavy and I'm captain
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
for the division of State Police
 
06:09:22.850 --> 06:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
overseeing the Marine Patrol unit the
 
06:09:24.170 --> 06:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
department of safety does not take a
 
06:09:26.448 --> 06:09:26.458 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but I am available
 
06:09:28.910 --> 06:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
for uh as a resource if any of you might
 
06:09:32.810 --> 06:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:35.390 --> 06:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
06:09:38.330 --> 06:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
06:09:40.010 --> 06:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
Captain thank you for taking my question
 
06:09:40.020 --> 06:09:41.628 align:start position:0%
Captain thank you for taking my question
certainly

06:09:41.628 --> 06:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
06:09:43.250 --> 06:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
06:09:43.260 --> 06:09:44.990 align:start position:0%
are there any
um

06:09:44.990 --> 06:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:45.000 --> 06:09:46.610 align:start position:0%
um
specific

06:09:46.610 --> 06:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
specific
 
06:09:49.850 --> 06:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
correlations between in studying speed
 
06:09:52.368 --> 06:09:52.378 align:start position:0%
and accidents available for New
 
06:09:55.430 --> 06:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:57.948 --> 06:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
no sir there are not we have not done
 
06:10:00.770 --> 06:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
any uh examination of any data as it
 
06:10:03.530 --> 06:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
relates to speed in accidents in New
 
06:10:03.540 --> 06:10:06.410 align:start position:0%
relates to speed in accidents in New
Hampshire

06:10:06.410 --> 06:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:10.850 --> 06:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:13.070 --> 06:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative tolarski
 
06:10:14.628 --> 06:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:10:16.970 --> 06:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question Captain can you
 
06:10:18.530 --> 06:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
please describe I know from what I
 
06:10:20.330 --> 06:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
understand the testimony some of these
 
06:10:24.830 --> 06:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
power boats can go 100 miles an hour
 
06:10:29.628 --> 06:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:33.470 --> 06:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
the reaction time of a driver trying to
 
06:10:34.850 --> 06:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
stop a boat
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
and how much distance it can travel
 
06:10:41.390 --> 06:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
before it actually can come to a safe
 
06:10:41.400 --> 06:10:43.548 align:start position:0%
before it actually can come to a safe
stop

06:10:43.548 --> 06:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
stop
 
06:10:45.288 --> 06:10:45.298 align:start position:0%
I will do my best to answer your
 
06:10:46.910 --> 06:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
question it's very difficult question
 
06:10:48.470 --> 06:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
because there are so many factors
 
06:10:50.990 --> 06:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
involved the first factor that comes to
 
06:10:54.230 --> 06:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
mind for me is the operator is reaction
 
06:10:57.230 --> 06:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
time the reaction time in the marine
 
06:10:59.270 --> 06:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
environment can be impacted by so many
 
06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
different variables it can be it can be
 
06:11:04.490 --> 06:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
affected by their attention
 
06:11:06.890 --> 06:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
it can be affected by just their
 
06:11:10.368 --> 06:11:10.378 align:start position:0%
physiology and whether it be age or or
 
06:11:15.048 --> 06:11:15.058 align:start position:0%
mental capacity to to observe
 
06:11:16.910 --> 06:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
issues that would cause them to react
 
06:11:19.010 --> 06:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
those things can be impaired by being
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
out in the weather all day long
 
06:11:24.788 --> 06:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
vibration heat humidity alcohol
 
06:11:27.170 --> 06:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
distractions on their boat the grandkids
 
06:11:29.868 --> 06:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
tugging on their shirt to go tubing all
 
06:11:32.030 --> 06:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
these things can can impact their they
 
06:11:33.470 --> 06:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
are known as stressors in the marine
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
environment that can impact a person's
 
06:11:37.368 --> 06:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
reaction time
 
06:11:41.448 --> 06:11:41.458 align:start position:0%
uh once a boat that is at speed uh wants
 
06:11:43.190 --> 06:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
to stop there are a variety of ways to
 
06:11:45.530 --> 06:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
make that happen certainly you can just
 
06:11:47.030 --> 06:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
chop the throttle as they would say
 
06:11:49.250 --> 06:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
bring the boat right back to neutral and
 
06:11:51.110 --> 06:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a time lapse before
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
that boat comes to a complete stop there
 
06:11:55.850 --> 06:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
are evasive actions with a steering
 
06:11:57.410 --> 06:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
wheel in the throttle at the same time
 
06:11:59.990 --> 06:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
and a person can even go into reverse
 
06:12:03.288 --> 06:12:03.298 align:start position:0%
but none of those are as effective as
 
06:12:05.208 --> 06:12:05.218 align:start position:0%
the brakes in an automobile might be as
 
06:12:07.128 --> 06:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
we've all come to experience as motor
 
06:12:09.890 --> 06:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
vehicle operators there is a delay in
 
06:12:11.570 --> 06:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
time before the vessel will come to a
 
06:12:13.670 --> 06:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
complete stop and depending upon the
 
06:12:16.730 --> 06:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
vessel and its original speed those
 
06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
times and distances will vary
 
06:12:22.548 --> 06:12:22.558 align:start position:0%
you all set yeah okay representative
 
06:12:22.558 --> 06:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
you all set yeah okay representative
Sykes

06:12:23.990 --> 06:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
Sykes
 
06:12:25.850 --> 06:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
captain again thank you for taking my
 
06:12:25.860 --> 06:12:27.288 align:start position:0%
captain again thank you for taking my
question

06:12:27.288 --> 06:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
um we heard some testimony earlier that
 
06:12:30.890 --> 06:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
the in New Hampshire there's a
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the numbers of
 
06:12:36.530 --> 06:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
um votes being registered is that a true
 
06:12:36.540 --> 06:12:37.610 align:start position:0%
um votes being registered is that a true
statement

06:12:37.610 --> 06:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
statement
 
06:12:39.048 --> 06:12:39.058 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sorry I didn't hear the
 
06:12:41.448 --> 06:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
question well I we heard earlier that
 
06:12:43.670 --> 06:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
there was a testimony that there's been
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
a significant increase in the numbers of
 
06:12:48.170 --> 06:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
boats that are registered here in New
 
06:12:49.490 --> 06:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recently is that a true
 
06:12:51.110 --> 06:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
statement that is a very true statement
 
06:12:55.010 --> 06:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
sir we the last two years uh the covet
 
06:12:56.750 --> 06:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic and outdoor activities in
 
06:12:58.910 --> 06:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
general certainly has been a significant
 
06:13:00.830 --> 06:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
factor in the increase in voting in New
 
06:13:03.288 --> 06:13:03.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across the country and
 
06:13:06.830 --> 06:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
we've seen a jump uh the last two years
 
06:13:09.048 --> 06:13:09.058 align:start position:0%
and about 10 000 registered votes on our
 
06:13:12.770 --> 06:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
water we're around 107 000 Last Summer
 
06:13:15.770 --> 06:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
on Pace again for that number this year
 
06:13:19.970 --> 06:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:22.190 --> 06:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
one of the studies that I've seen
 
06:13:24.830 --> 06:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
indicates that a really important
 
06:13:28.368 --> 06:13:28.378 align:start position:0%
correlation between boating accidents
 
06:13:32.170 --> 06:13:32.180 align:start position:0%
is density of use
 
06:13:34.670 --> 06:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
would there not be a correlation between
 
06:13:36.830 --> 06:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
the numbers of voting licenses that have
 
06:13:38.570 --> 06:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
given out and the densities that we'll
 
06:13:40.128 --> 06:13:40.138 align:start position:0%
see on the lakes and Waters of New
 
06:13:40.138 --> 06:13:41.390 align:start position:0%
see on the lakes and Waters of New
Hampshire

06:13:41.390 --> 06:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
certainly New Hampshire numbers show
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
that the more registered votes we have
 
06:13:47.330 --> 06:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
the higher accidents a number of
 
06:13:50.170 --> 06:13:50.180 align:start position:0%
reportable accidents we have a year
 
06:13:52.788 --> 06:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
it's important to look closely at that
 
06:13:55.548 --> 06:13:55.558 align:start position:0%
type of of accident data historically
 
06:13:57.890 --> 06:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
the number one cause of accidents in New
 
06:14:00.128 --> 06:14:00.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are probably
 
06:14:04.070 --> 06:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
striking our natural hazards rocks ledge
 
06:14:06.110 --> 06:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
outcroppings we are the granite state
 
06:14:08.510 --> 06:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that Granite shows itself
 
06:14:09.890 --> 06:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's just under the
 
06:14:12.288 --> 06:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
surface the second leading cause for
 
06:14:14.930 --> 06:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
accidents frankly is Damage Done to
 
06:14:16.730 --> 06:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
other boats while boats are trying to
 
06:14:19.128 --> 06:14:19.138 align:start position:0%
dock in Close Quarter maneuvering and
 
06:14:20.990 --> 06:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
Then followed by personal injuries
 
06:14:39.708 --> 06:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:41.628 --> 06:14:41.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Captain thank you for
 
06:14:43.368 --> 06:14:43.378 align:start position:0%
your testimony certainly sir
 
06:14:43.378 --> 06:14:44.570 align:start position:0%
your testimony certainly sir
um

06:14:44.570 --> 06:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:46.788 --> 06:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
we here in the house and in the Senate
 
06:14:49.910 --> 06:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
and with the governor we pass laws when
 
06:14:51.948 --> 06:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
we pass a law we intend for it to be
 
06:14:54.350 --> 06:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
enforced yes sir and the bottom line is
 
06:14:57.230 --> 06:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
do you have the personnel and the
 
06:15:00.830 --> 06:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
resources you need to enforce this law
 
06:15:04.190 --> 06:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
if we allow this to be
 
06:15:04.200 --> 06:15:07.670 align:start position:0%
if we allow this to be
repealed

06:15:07.670 --> 06:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:09.770 --> 06:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
and allow these boats to go apparently
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
as fast as they want because we've had
 
06:15:14.868 --> 06:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
no other proposed speed limit as part of
 
06:15:16.150 --> 06:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:15:19.250 --> 06:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
how would you enforce that
 
06:15:21.530 --> 06:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
well certainly we have geared up to
 
06:15:24.230 --> 06:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
enforce what's on the books now we have
 
06:15:25.548 --> 06:15:25.558 align:start position:0%
the equipment we have the speed
 
06:15:27.430 --> 06:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
measuring devices
 
06:15:31.128 --> 06:15:31.138 align:start position:0%
so if this bill were to pass and that
 
06:15:34.010 --> 06:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
speed limit were to be repealed it's not
 
06:15:35.810 --> 06:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
going to change our officers day-to-day
 
06:15:38.150 --> 06:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
activity our speed enforcement now is
 
06:15:40.610 --> 06:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
part of their routine Patrol it would be
 
06:15:42.650 --> 06:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
one thing that we just are not paying
 
06:15:44.930 --> 06:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
attention to frankly because we wouldn't
 
06:15:47.690 --> 06:15:47.700 align:start position:0%
have a law on the books to enforce
 
06:15:51.048 --> 06:15:51.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:54.830 --> 06:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate that would result in
 
06:15:57.650 --> 06:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
increased accidents
 
06:15:59.868 --> 06:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to say our numbers before
 
06:16:01.730 --> 06:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
the speed limit and sense the speed
 
06:16:04.970 --> 06:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
limit are showing a trend of the same uh
 
06:16:06.708 --> 06:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same data Trends
 
06:16:09.288 --> 06:16:09.298 align:start position:0%
accident related certainly because we
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
have a law on the books now we do have
 
06:16:13.850 --> 06:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
numbers of speeding tickets and warnings
 
06:16:16.610 --> 06:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
that that are being issued by officers I
 
06:16:17.990 --> 06:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't have those numbers off the top of
 
06:16:20.810 --> 06:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
my head I can tell you that there are
 
06:16:22.730 --> 06:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
more issued at night after the half hour
 
06:16:25.368 --> 06:16:25.378 align:start position:0%
after Sunset because more boats frankly
 
06:16:28.250 --> 06:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
can exceed that speed but we do have
 
06:16:30.830 --> 06:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
some Daytime violations as well
 
06:16:34.250 --> 06:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much certainly
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stevens did you have a
 
06:16:36.000 --> 06:16:37.548 align:start position:0%
representative Stevens did you have a
question

06:16:37.548 --> 06:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:16:39.770 --> 06:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
as I know wrong
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Rambo go ahead
 
06:16:44.390 --> 06:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
06:16:45.530 --> 06:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
question Captain
 
06:16:47.330 --> 06:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
um as it's come up in discussion a few
 
06:16:49.970 --> 06:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
times I'm hoping in your role if you
 
06:16:52.788 --> 06:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
could Define for us what the broads are
 
06:16:54.410 --> 06:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
I will agree with many of the speakers
 
06:16:56.750 --> 06:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
that have come before me and that a
 
06:16:58.430 --> 06:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
definition of the broads is going to
 
06:16:59.930 --> 06:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
depend on the person you're speaking
 
06:16:59.940 --> 06:17:01.128 align:start position:0%
depend on the person you're speaking
with

06:17:01.128 --> 06:17:01.138 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:17:03.170 --> 06:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
um it was summarized by by one lady
 
06:17:05.868 --> 06:17:05.878 align:start position:0%
earlier where depending upon what island
 
06:17:07.448 --> 06:17:07.458 align:start position:0%
what point
 
06:17:09.530 --> 06:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
whether you go all the way to Center
 
06:17:12.490 --> 06:17:12.500 align:start position:0%
Harbor in you know Six Mile Island
 
06:17:15.170 --> 06:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
inside outside of Welch Island do you
 
06:17:17.448 --> 06:17:17.458 align:start position:0%
include the 40s there are so many
 
06:17:17.458 --> 06:17:19.070 align:start position:0%
include the 40s there are so many
variables

06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
variables
 
06:17:21.350 --> 06:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and it would be very difficult in my
 
06:17:25.330 --> 06:17:25.340 align:start position:0%
opinion absent uh significant signage
 
06:17:29.810 --> 06:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
and um promotion of those boundaries for
 
06:17:32.510 --> 06:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
even the visiting public to be aware of
 
06:17:34.368 --> 06:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
that zone
 
06:17:36.048 --> 06:17:36.058 align:start position:0%
not impossible but it would be a
 
06:17:36.058 --> 06:17:38.690 align:start position:0%
not impossible but it would be a
challenge

06:17:38.690 --> 06:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:38.700 --> 06:17:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
Crawford

06:17:40.910 --> 06:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
Crawford
 
06:17:45.110 --> 06:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman do do you we have
 
06:17:45.120 --> 06:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman do do you we have
um

06:17:45.830 --> 06:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:48.948 --> 06:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
fines for speeding on the lake are there
 
06:17:51.830 --> 06:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
are there like when you go 20 miles over
 
06:17:53.810 --> 06:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
the speed limit in a car
 
06:17:56.030 --> 06:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
there's a fine for that do we have fines
 
06:17:58.850 --> 06:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
like that for boating we have there is a
 
06:18:00.830 --> 06:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
fine but it is set by the court it is
 
06:18:02.448 --> 06:18:02.458 align:start position:0%
not one of those fines that has a flat
 
06:18:02.458 --> 06:18:03.190 align:start position:0%
not one of those fines that has a flat
rate

06:18:03.190 --> 06:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
rate
 
06:18:05.090 --> 06:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
like you might find on the road
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
depending upon how much over the speed
 
06:18:09.070 --> 06:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
limit you're going there are numerous
 
06:18:11.930 --> 06:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
violations in our state where it's up to
 
06:18:14.208 --> 06:18:14.218 align:start position:0%
the court or the judge to decide once
 
06:18:15.770 --> 06:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
there's a conviction in place and this
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
is one of them
 
06:18:21.770 --> 06:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
spot thank you and if we eliminate the
 
06:18:24.970 --> 06:18:24.980 align:start position:0%
speed limits on Winnipesaukee and you
 
06:18:27.708 --> 06:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
have your radar or whatever you're using
 
06:18:29.030 --> 06:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
out there
 
06:18:33.230 --> 06:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
with a boat going 100 miles an hour
 
06:18:36.048 --> 06:18:36.058 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse for that I'm
 
06:18:38.510 --> 06:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
assuming it would definitely changes I'm
 
06:18:40.190 --> 06:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
sorry it would that not be a violation
 
06:18:43.310 --> 06:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
we would still have uh based on this
 
06:18:45.110 --> 06:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
bill's language we would still have the
 
06:18:46.910 --> 06:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
nighttime speed limit to be enforcing
 
06:18:48.650 --> 06:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
and so that equipment would still be
 
06:18:50.690 --> 06:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
used for that purpose but during the day
 
06:18:52.490 --> 06:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
there would not be a need to stop
 
06:18:54.350 --> 06:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
somebody doing 100 miles an hour unless
 
06:18:57.230 --> 06:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
we're unless we're seeing other outside
 
06:18:59.510 --> 06:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
factors involved maybe close proximity
 
06:19:02.288 --> 06:19:02.298 align:start position:0%
to another vessel
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
congested traffic in one of the little
 
06:19:07.730 --> 06:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
towns around the lake where a speed like
 
06:19:09.590 --> 06:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
that would rise to the level of being a
 
06:19:11.270 --> 06:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
careless and negligent operation of a
 
06:19:14.930 --> 06:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:17.690 --> 06:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh yes thank you sir
 
06:19:19.850 --> 06:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming to a couple questions
 
06:19:22.250 --> 06:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind Mr chair you seem
 
06:19:23.690 --> 06:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
pretty knowledgeable on the increase of
 
06:19:26.570 --> 06:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
voter registrations can you go a little
 
06:19:29.810 --> 06:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
further how many more rentals per se do
 
06:19:31.310 --> 06:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know the number of increase in
 
06:19:33.890 --> 06:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
rentals or maybe by a percentage
 
06:19:35.990 --> 06:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
I do not have a number on the renters I
 
06:19:38.090 --> 06:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
can tell you that
 
06:19:39.830 --> 06:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the number that you heard earlier for
 
06:19:42.048 --> 06:19:42.058 align:start position:0%
the number of people who became
 
06:19:44.510 --> 06:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
certified to operate a boat in New
 
06:19:47.030 --> 06:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire last year topped over thirty
 
06:19:49.010 --> 06:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
thousand we have not seen a number like
 
06:19:51.048 --> 06:19:51.058 align:start position:0%
that in 20 years when the law first came
 
06:19:54.048 --> 06:19:54.058 align:start position:0%
into effect on average we're between six
 
06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
and eight thousand a year and we were
 
06:19:58.610 --> 06:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
over thirty thousand um
 
06:20:01.368 --> 06:20:01.378 align:start position:0%
during the peak coveted time part of
 
06:20:03.590 --> 06:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
that I will say was a result of the
 
06:20:06.170 --> 06:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency rule where the
 
06:20:08.208 --> 06:20:08.218 align:start position:0%
proctored exam requirement was waived
 
06:20:12.048 --> 06:20:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's not really a follow-up just another
 
06:20:16.070 --> 06:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
question in your experience because I
 
06:20:17.150 --> 06:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
know you've been doing this for a long
 
06:20:19.190 --> 06:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
time in all reality what's your
 
06:20:21.590 --> 06:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
estimation how many boats can actually
 
06:20:26.628 --> 06:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:29.090 --> 06:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's really a difficult question
 
06:20:29.100 --> 06:20:32.750 align:start position:0%
it's really a difficult question
um

06:20:32.750 --> 06:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:34.968 --> 06:20:34.978 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't dare I wouldn't dare guess
 
06:20:37.070 --> 06:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
that there were again so many factors I
 
06:20:38.830 --> 06:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
would say that the
 
06:20:41.330 --> 06:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
average boat on Winnipesaukee that
 
06:20:44.090 --> 06:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
you're seeing now is probably 24 foot in
 
06:20:45.650 --> 06:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
length and up
 
06:20:47.868 --> 06:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
there are kayaks and sailboats and so
 
06:20:49.368 --> 06:20:49.378 align:start position:0%
forth that I wouldn't count to that but
 
06:20:50.750 --> 06:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
registered votes you're probably looking
 
06:20:52.850 --> 06:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
at an average of 24 and up
 
06:20:55.070 --> 06:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh certainly low we know in Industry
 
06:20:55.080 --> 06:20:56.930 align:start position:0%
uh certainly low we know in Industry
that

06:20:56.930 --> 06:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:20:59.448 --> 06:20:59.458 align:start position:0%
um right now to get a an engine between
 
06:21:02.270 --> 06:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
two and 300 horsepower you're waiting a
 
06:21:04.310 --> 06:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
year to get it so the demand is on those
 
06:21:06.708 --> 06:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
higher horsepower vessels
 
06:21:06.718 --> 06:21:07.730 align:start position:0%
higher horsepower vessels
um

06:21:07.730 --> 06:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:09.590 --> 06:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
depending upon the whole configuration
 
06:21:11.690 --> 06:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
how many people are in it whether they
 
06:21:14.448 --> 06:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
could do 45 or 55 is really going to
 
06:21:14.458 --> 06:21:15.288 align:start position:0%
could do 45 or 55 is really going to
vary

06:21:15.288 --> 06:21:15.298 align:start position:0%
vary
 
06:21:17.810 --> 06:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of them sir I would say are on
 
06:21:23.868 --> 06:21:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:25.850 --> 06:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
and if I can I just I get in late and I
 
06:21:28.968 --> 06:21:28.978 align:start position:0%
apologize and he did I hear that the
 
06:21:30.650 --> 06:21:30.660 align:start position:0%
department is not taking a position on
 
06:21:35.030 --> 06:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:37.250 --> 06:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
representative field
 
06:21:39.048 --> 06:21:39.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:21:41.030 --> 06:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:21:41.040 --> 06:21:41.810 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:21:41.810 --> 06:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:45.350 --> 06:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
I spent time on on Winnipesaukee and and
 
06:21:48.010 --> 06:21:48.020 align:start position:0%
then the broads and I do know that
 
06:21:50.690 --> 06:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
weather can come into
 
06:21:53.868 --> 06:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
on the lake in a in a hurry
 
06:21:57.350 --> 06:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
and I also know that I've run into a
 
06:22:00.350 --> 06:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
number of floating objects out uh in the
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
broads in various times so what I'm I'm
 
06:22:06.708 --> 06:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
trying to ask is in relation to those
 
06:22:08.030 --> 06:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
two items
 
06:22:09.890 --> 06:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
how would
 
06:22:09.900 --> 06:22:10.788 align:start position:0%
how would
um

06:22:10.788 --> 06:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:13.788 --> 06:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
how would the braking distance of of
 
06:22:13.798 --> 06:22:16.010 align:start position:0%
how would the braking distance of of
boats

06:22:16.010 --> 06:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
boats
 
06:22:19.128 --> 06:22:19.138 align:start position:0%
be affected by by those two items when
 
06:22:22.190 --> 06:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
we're when you're increasing that speed
 
06:22:26.930 --> 06:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
from the current set speed up to an
 
06:22:29.390 --> 06:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
unlimited number it's it's the braking
 
06:22:31.070 --> 06:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
distance that I'm mostly worried about
 
06:22:33.708 --> 06:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
when you see a floating log or something
 
06:22:35.570 --> 06:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
like that
 
06:22:37.310 --> 06:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
so in a condition as you've described
 
06:22:39.288 --> 06:22:39.298 align:start position:0%
with high winds and high wave action
 
06:22:41.208 --> 06:22:41.218 align:start position:0%
certainly that's when we do see our
 
06:22:43.788 --> 06:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
hazards and those hazards can be logs it
 
06:22:45.830 --> 06:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
can be things that have washed off the
 
06:22:47.930 --> 06:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
beach in the form of kayaks and canoes
 
06:22:49.788 --> 06:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
it can be boats that have broken their
 
06:22:52.850 --> 06:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
Mooring chain and are unattended
 
06:22:54.310 --> 06:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
um certainly
 
06:22:57.830 --> 06:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
with the rough water comes the ability
 
06:23:00.890 --> 06:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
for a boat to travel high speeds to be
 
06:23:03.170 --> 06:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
reduced most of the boats you're going
 
06:23:05.510 --> 06:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
to find absent your out show offshore
 
06:23:08.110 --> 06:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
power boats and your real big
 
06:23:10.250 --> 06:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
vessels that are made for that type of
 
06:23:12.170 --> 06:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
weather are going to have to be at
 
06:23:14.448 --> 06:23:14.458 align:start position:0%
probably a slower speed than 45 to just
 
06:23:16.910 --> 06:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
be able to operate in rough choppy
 
06:23:20.030 --> 06:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
weather but your higher speeds of boats
 
06:23:21.468 --> 06:23:21.478 align:start position:0%
that are capable of exceeding those
 
06:23:24.048 --> 06:23:24.058 align:start position:0%
larger speeds are also capable of being
 
06:23:26.990 --> 06:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
operated in a heavier chop so depending
 
06:23:28.670 --> 06:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
upon the height of the chop the type of
 
06:23:30.610 --> 06:23:30.620 align:start position:0%
wind and storm you're dealing with
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
may become an issue for Speed and
 
06:23:36.170 --> 06:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
braking distance or it may not sorry for
 
06:23:37.730 --> 06:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
the non-answer but those are the factors
 
06:23:40.310 --> 06:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
involved no I guess I guess I follow up
 
06:23:40.320 --> 06:23:41.270 align:start position:0%
involved no I guess I guess I follow up
quickly

06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
06:23:44.270 --> 06:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
um sure thank you what what I'm getting
 
06:23:48.110 --> 06:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
to is is enforcement
 
06:23:51.788 --> 06:23:51.798 align:start position:0%
um and and items of that nature
 
06:23:54.590 --> 06:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
how would you determine when it is
 
06:23:58.548 --> 06:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
unsafe for uh going at a at a higher
 
06:24:00.110 --> 06:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
rate of speed I guess
 
06:24:02.510 --> 06:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
is that we would certainly look at the
 
06:24:04.430 --> 06:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
the boat's ability to navigate those
 
06:24:06.708 --> 06:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
types of waters
 
06:24:09.230 --> 06:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
if if occupants are being tossed around
 
06:24:12.530 --> 06:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
if the if the boat itself has limited
 
06:24:14.868 --> 06:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
free board or or free space before it's
 
06:24:17.810 --> 06:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
taking on water whether it's an enclosed
 
06:24:20.330 --> 06:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
bow or a bow Rider that is open to the
 
06:24:21.948 --> 06:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
elements those are all things that we
 
06:24:23.690 --> 06:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
would look at the general safety of that
 
06:24:26.690 --> 06:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
vessel operating in that weather and if
 
06:24:28.850 --> 06:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
the officer determines that that the
 
06:24:32.090 --> 06:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
operator by their actions is endangering
 
06:24:33.708 --> 06:24:33.718 align:start position:0%
themselves of somebody on that vessel we
 
06:24:35.570 --> 06:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
would stop them
 
06:24:37.610 --> 06:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
06:24:40.730 --> 06:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:42.948 --> 06:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski
 
06:24:44.390 --> 06:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I thank you
 
06:24:46.788 --> 06:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
Captain for taking my question we've
 
06:24:48.170 --> 06:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
heard many testimony today about
 
06:24:51.170 --> 06:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
inexperienced boaters can you give us a
 
06:24:54.048 --> 06:24:54.058 align:start position:0%
sense of do you have any like numbers or
 
06:24:57.708 --> 06:24:57.718 align:start position:0%
statistics of citations you've given to
 
06:24:59.690 --> 06:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
inexperienced voters while they're on
 
06:25:01.910 --> 06:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
the lake
 
06:25:05.570 --> 06:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
we do issue and as time has gone on and
 
06:25:08.270 --> 06:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
and more and more people uh visiting our
 
06:25:10.310 --> 06:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
state come from a state that requires it
 
06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
those numbers have started to drop a
 
06:25:14.390 --> 06:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
little bit off the top of my head I
 
06:25:16.368 --> 06:25:16.378 align:start position:0%
don't know our enforcement numbers for
 
06:25:18.170 --> 06:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
the education requirement I would be
 
06:25:19.670 --> 06:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
happy to get those for you and pass them
 
06:25:22.730 --> 06:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
along to user certainly
 
06:25:25.070 --> 06:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
we started off when we first introduced
 
06:25:27.770 --> 06:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
our own new folks first required voting
 
06:25:30.590 --> 06:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
education in this state which was a
 
06:25:33.948 --> 06:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
early 2000s we were the ninth state in
 
06:25:36.350 --> 06:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
the country to require it now there are
 
06:25:38.868 --> 06:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
only three that don't require it or some
 
06:25:41.810 --> 06:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
form of it but offer it so we're finding
 
06:25:44.750 --> 06:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of people visiting us already have
 
06:25:50.628 --> 06:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:55.190 --> 06:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:55.200 --> 06:25:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
um Captain

06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
um Captain
 
06:25:59.330 --> 06:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
how big is this tool that we're going to
 
06:26:01.128 --> 06:26:01.138 align:start position:0%
take away from you if we were to accept
 
06:26:02.390 --> 06:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:26:04.368 --> 06:26:04.378 align:start position:0%
how big is the weather how big is this
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
tool the speed tool that we're going to
 
06:26:09.650 --> 06:26:09.660 align:start position:0%
take away from you
 
06:26:13.190 --> 06:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:17.208 --> 06:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
um I I would defer to the public sir the
 
06:26:18.650 --> 06:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
department of safety historically has
 
06:26:20.208 --> 06:26:20.218 align:start position:0%
taken the position on these types of
 
06:26:22.670 --> 06:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
bills to allow the boning public to
 
06:26:25.010 --> 06:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
decide how they want to be regulated and
 
06:26:26.750 --> 06:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's a fair description of
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
where Department of Safety stands on on
 
06:26:33.288 --> 06:26:33.298 align:start position:0%
this by removing this as a tool
 
06:26:33.298 --> 06:26:34.730 align:start position:0%
this by removing this as a tool
um

06:26:34.730 --> 06:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:38.570 --> 06:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:38.580 --> 06:26:41.090 align:start position:0%
 
but

06:26:41.090 --> 06:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:26:41.100 --> 06:26:42.468 align:start position:0%
but
although

06:26:42.468 --> 06:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
although
 
06:26:42.478 --> 06:26:43.610 align:start position:0%
although
um

06:26:43.610 --> 06:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:45.530 --> 06:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that was the answer I was
 
06:26:46.968 --> 06:26:46.978 align:start position:0%
looking for but
 
06:26:46.978 --> 06:26:49.250 align:start position:0%
looking for but
um

06:26:49.250 --> 06:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:51.708 --> 06:26:51.718 align:start position:0%
is this
 
06:26:55.250 --> 06:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
is this going to be I mean it's it's
 
06:26:57.170 --> 06:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
like we took the speed limit off the
 
06:26:57.180 --> 06:26:58.310 align:start position:0%
like we took the speed limit off the
highway

06:26:58.310 --> 06:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
highway
 
06:27:01.070 --> 06:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
how big a safety
 
06:27:03.890 --> 06:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
tool is that for you to have speed
 
06:27:06.288 --> 06:27:06.298 align:start position:0%
limits on the highway
 
06:27:08.448 --> 06:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
and I can't imagine it's any different
 
06:27:14.690 --> 06:27:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:16.850 --> 06:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put you on the spot
 
06:27:19.430 --> 06:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
remember I think you are putting him on
 
06:27:21.410 --> 06:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
the spot because I don't think it's he
 
06:27:23.510 --> 06:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
can't determine that yeah it would I
 
06:27:25.430 --> 06:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
guess it would all depend on
 
06:27:25.440 --> 06:27:26.270 align:start position:0%
guess it would all depend on
um

06:27:26.270 --> 06:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:29.270 --> 06:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
how people would react to the ability to
 
06:27:31.070 --> 06:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
travel at those High rates of speeds and
 
06:27:33.468 --> 06:27:33.478 align:start position:0%
where they would choose to do it
 
06:27:37.010 --> 06:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and and all of those would be factors
 
06:27:41.330 --> 06:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative tolerski
 
06:27:42.708 --> 06:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for one last
 
06:27:44.750 --> 06:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it
 
06:27:44.760 --> 06:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate it
um

06:27:45.830 --> 06:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:48.288 --> 06:27:48.298 align:start position:0%
I imagine that there's not many bodies
 
06:27:49.368 --> 06:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
of water
 
06:27:51.650 --> 06:27:51.660 align:start position:0%
with the
 
06:27:53.930 --> 06:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
sheer area of Winnipesaukee that allow
 
06:27:56.868 --> 06:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
these types of boats in the region
 
06:27:59.390 --> 06:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
is there a chance that if we repealed
 
06:28:02.150 --> 06:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
the speed limit
 
06:28:04.310 --> 06:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
normally we think that drawing in
 
06:28:07.610 --> 06:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
tourism is a great idea that this could
 
06:28:09.910 --> 06:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
have an unintended consequence
 
06:28:14.090 --> 06:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
of a huge spike in the number of these
 
06:28:16.070 --> 06:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
high-powered boats coming to
 
06:28:18.730 --> 06:28:18.740 align:start position:0%
Winnipesaukee which would then
 
06:28:21.410 --> 06:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
exacerbate any safety problem we could
 
06:28:25.010 --> 06:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.288 --> 06:28:27.298 align:start position:0%
not knowing how many would come
 
06:28:27.298 --> 06:28:28.548 align:start position:0%
not knowing how many would come
um

06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:31.010 --> 06:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure certainly I guess that
 
06:28:33.230 --> 06:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
possibility exists while at the same
 
06:28:35.330 --> 06:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
time it you know it it may not increase
 
06:28:37.610 --> 06:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
our numbers it all depends on how many
 
06:28:39.410 --> 06:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
were to come how fast they would choose
 
06:28:40.270 --> 06:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
to go
 
06:28:43.670 --> 06:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's again a lot of variables and I
 
06:28:45.530 --> 06:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
apologize for the non-inser I just don't
 
06:28:47.090 --> 06:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
know how we could predict in other words
 
06:28:49.310 --> 06:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
you can't predict the future
 
06:28:51.110 --> 06:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's different there's
 
06:28:52.850 --> 06:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
just so many factors correct okay so
 
06:28:56.690 --> 06:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:58.490 --> 06:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead
 
06:29:00.830 --> 06:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is an easy one I know
 
06:29:02.150 --> 06:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
you're not taking a position on the bill
 
06:29:04.250 --> 06:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
as as a division do you have any
 
06:29:06.890 --> 06:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
information in terms of data since the
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
the uh speed limit was put in place and
 
06:29:11.990 --> 06:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
I forget what year it is offhand
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're just I'm seeking information that
 
06:29:15.048 --> 06:29:15.058 align:start position:0%
may help the committee come to a
 
06:29:16.368 --> 06:29:16.378 align:start position:0%
decision on this is there anything you
 
06:29:18.590 --> 06:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
can provide as a division or Department
 
06:29:20.930 --> 06:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
the the only data that we have available
 
06:29:23.570 --> 06:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
and and we've provided it to many people
 
06:29:25.910 --> 06:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
in this room today is our accident
 
06:29:29.810 --> 06:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
numbers because pre speed limit law we
 
06:29:31.910 --> 06:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
had accident numbers post we had
 
06:29:33.410 --> 06:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
accident numbers we didn't have speed
 
06:29:35.810 --> 06:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
numbers Before the bill came into being
 
06:29:38.030 --> 06:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
because there was no need for it so the
 
06:29:40.490 --> 06:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
the the common denominator here would be
 
06:29:43.190 --> 06:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
accident numbers uh and we have provided
 
06:29:44.930 --> 06:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
those to to many folks in this room
 
06:29:46.010 --> 06:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
today and I think you've heard some
 
06:29:47.868 --> 06:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
testimony to that
 
06:29:51.110 --> 06:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
um the the number of accidents directly
 
06:29:53.150 --> 06:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
related to speed
 
06:29:53.160 --> 06:29:54.650 align:start position:0%
related to speed
um

06:29:54.650 --> 06:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:56.750 --> 06:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
again you need to look at the finer
 
06:30:00.770 --> 06:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
details of the accident itself was
 
06:30:03.910 --> 06:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
speed a factor or a contributing factor
 
06:30:06.830 --> 06:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
can all depend is it boat to boat is it
 
06:30:08.868 --> 06:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
boat to shore is it boat hitting a rock
 
06:30:11.030 --> 06:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
in which case any speed could be
 
06:30:12.548 --> 06:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
considered a factor
 
06:30:16.128 --> 06:30:16.138 align:start position:0%
so we we by our data set and what we
 
06:30:17.448 --> 06:30:17.458 align:start position:0%
have to report to the Coast Guard
 
06:30:20.110 --> 06:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
annually is just was speed to continue
 
06:30:22.310 --> 06:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
contributing factor
 
06:30:25.250 --> 06:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
someone doing 15 miles an hour around a
 
06:30:28.128 --> 06:30:28.138 align:start position:0%
public dock is too fast and so speed was
 
06:30:31.548 --> 06:30:31.558 align:start position:0%
then a consider a contributing factor so
 
06:30:33.410 --> 06:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
those numbers you need to look at each
 
06:30:35.330 --> 06:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
report individually to see how fast the
 
06:30:37.490 --> 06:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
boat was going did it hit a rocket did
 
06:30:39.708 --> 06:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
it hit another boat or hit an island and
 
06:30:41.390 --> 06:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
so there are many variables but
 
06:30:43.730 --> 06:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
typically we do not have more than five
 
06:30:47.208 --> 06:30:47.218 align:start position:0%
or six boat accidents a year where speed
 
06:30:48.770 --> 06:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
was a contributing factor whether that
 
06:30:57.650 --> 06:30:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:00.048 --> 06:31:00.058 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Dunleavy don't forget to
 
06:31:01.850 --> 06:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
fill out that pin card it's awesome
 
06:31:08.330 --> 06:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:10.670 --> 06:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
seeing that
 
06:31:13.010 --> 06:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
they have no no more pink cards so
 
06:31:19.548 --> 06:31:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:19.558 --> 06:31:41.150 align:start position:0%
 
standard

06:31:41.150 --> 06:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:02.570 --> 06:32:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:29.570 --> 06:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:29.580 --> 06:32:54.890 align:start position:0%
 
together

06:32:54.890 --> 06:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
