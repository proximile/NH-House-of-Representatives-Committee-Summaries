00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
will introduce HB
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
214 I'm not going to take any questions
 
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
on 24
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
immediately uh reuno will introduce HB
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
594 FN I'm hoping he also will not take
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
any questions immediately we're going to
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
hand The Paton off to uh the director of
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
facilities at the Department of
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
Education Miss Amy Clark and then uh
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative luno and I will be
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
available for
 
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
questioning after we hear from the the
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
specialist from the Department by doing
 
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
this I believe we may have some
 
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
questions answered by the technician
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
there at doe and we won't be replicating
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
or duplicating questions later on so
 
00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:58.519 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to hand that gavl
 
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
over to to representative
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli become a person testifying I
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
did hand in my paperwork on the
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
computers not my paperwork but my uh
 
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
request to speak and there's a copy for
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
the floor thank
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you chairman I would like to
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
on4 and on of
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
24 chairman L for the introduction of
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you very much uh
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um I'm going for
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Rick blad I
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
represent hail Grafton for that's hail
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not hav
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
ma uh for the record I will go ahead and
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
take portions of what I presided
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
presented to the clerk summary and and
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
then I want to hit on an area of of why
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
we need building Aid not necessarily
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
directly talking about that bill as with
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
all aspects of public education
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
including adequacy regular education CTE
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools special education
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation Etc corporations are
 
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
based upon dollar availability in regard
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
to school building a the existing
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
statute defines that the amount
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
appropriated qu shall not exceed $50
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
million we know that this amount is
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
totally inappropriate not based upon
 
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
program primarily based upon paying down
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
debt that at one time exceeded $540
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
million the if we're looking at FY 23
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
the debt portion of if we were to fund
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
at a level of $50 million would be $32
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
million that would leave $18 million
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
left for new
 
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
Renovations uh new construction of
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
school facilities houses throughout this
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
state I'll leave the rest to um either
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh luno or to our
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
specialist from the Department to to
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
testify that however I like to take off
 
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
and read a little bit about some of the
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
other aspects I think that are very
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
critical uh to school building
 
00:13:23.949 --> 00:13:23.959 align:start position:0%
Aid there is a link between student
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
achievement and the condition of school
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
buildings scho buildings generally are
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
those that lack appropriate HBA systems
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
have poor lighting old un noisy ra
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
functional Furniture but have some
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
variation or combination of those
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
qualities numerous Studies have
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that students in po buildings
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
perform less well than students in
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
functional or acceptable
 
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
buildings research has found that
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
students in poor buildings older
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
buildings and those which are not being
 
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
pain or those that are out of date
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
scored between five to 10 percen rank
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
points lower than students and
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
functional buildings and that's after
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
controlling for socioeconomic status in
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
other words this issue is not just
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
limited to those in poverty the
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
difference in scores for students in
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
poor buildings can be as high as 177% F
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
points older buildings generally do not
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
have those elements I spoke to earlier
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
control of thermal environment
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
acceptable lighting acoustical control
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
and functional Furniture to compound
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
this issue most most of the older school
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
buildings and those buildings in poor
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
condition are located in areas of
 
00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
condition are located in areas of
greatest

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
greatest
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
hty lastly there is an abundance of
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
research that directly Associates the
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of students and
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
staff to the condition of school
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
building the US Environmental Protection
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
Agency has estimated that more than 10
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
million days of schooling are lost each
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
year through our country by students
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
with asthma attacks a study of 21,000
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
students found that those students in
 
00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:00.519 align:start position:0%
schools were add daylighting scored 20%
 
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
higher on achievement test than students
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
in schools with no day lighting sixth
 
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
grade students in noisy buildings were s
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
years behind in Reading in those
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
buildings that had old science equipment
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
the students 8 perenti rank points for
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
those students using newer functional
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
equipment I've attempted to convey a
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
rationale that student School building
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
Aid and the costing an adequate
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
education are linked adequacy outcomes
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
are definitely influenced by school
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and Associated conditions New
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has an abundance of outdated
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
school buildings we've heard testimony
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
in past years from the school boards
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
Association School administrator
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
Association the doe and various folks
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
from various districts throughout the
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
state that we have over 50% of our
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
buildings now that are over 60 years old
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
we have a backload of applications in
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
past years we've had in the last basic
 
00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
decade we've had approved four building
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
Aid projects of which one was an
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
emergency three were just recently done
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
I will let um Amy Park speak to that so
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
in conclusion this bill simply does one
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
thing it uh states that no less than $50
 
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
million will be appropriated for school
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
building Aid at this point in time the
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
department is is restricted from submit
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
submitting budgets for this that are
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
over $50 million by this statutory
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
language so the statutory language as
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
proposed would say no less than $50
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
million thank you very much for for your
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
time and I'll pass that baton off to
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
represent luno to speak to his his bill
 
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
terrific thank you very much um
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative lad and thank you very

serving on the the house education
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
committee um uh House Bill
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
594 is a p is part of a package of bills
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
that flow from the findings and
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the school funding
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
commission these bills excuse me these
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
bills each can stand on their own but
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
they also align with each other and
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
embrace the core values to improve
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
student and taxpayer equity Equity
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean equal it means Fair it's
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
not a one-sized fits-all solution but
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
one that is responsive to the needs of a
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
community and the resources available to
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
that Community House Bill 594 relates to
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
the school building aid program that
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative lad uh just talked about
 
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and I I I clearly uh Embrace and
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
endorse everything that he just um just
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
said um uh Hill 594 is not the
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
centerpiece of the commission's
 
00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
recommend ation but it's a very
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
important piece other bills that come
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
from the commission's work include House
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 504 directed to the low and
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
moderate income property tax relief
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
program and state property tax reform
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
and Senate bill it's it's still in LSR
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
1052 which is a comprehensive Bill to
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
define the cost of an adequate education
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
and Implement a funding formula to make
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
sure every district has access to the
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
financial resources it needs to get
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
there like I said these bills can all
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
stand alone but they all work well
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
together too um so what I'd like to do
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
is walk through House Bill
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
594 and highlight the proposed changes
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
to the building aid program the changes
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
were developed in cooperation from the
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
department and Miss Clark will follow
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
our introductions to talk about the
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
building aid program and the impact
 
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
these changes would have on school
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
districts that have already started or
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
completed facility projects or have um
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
have projects in the pipeline so um
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
um so if I might just go go very quickly
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
um through the bill it'll only take um
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully a minute or two it starts very
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
much the same as um as House Bill 214
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
and is what chair lad uh talked about uh
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
bumping the um the the uh the funding
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
for building Aid up to $50 million a
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
year um uh in the U in both bills and in
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
existing statutes that's somewhat
 
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.830 align:start position:0%
existing statutes that's somewhat
tempered

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
tempered
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
by by any unless otherwise provided by
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
an act to the general court which I
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
interpret as the the state budget so um
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
so advocacy for building Aid doesn't
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
stop with these bills but um um but it's
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
important that uh that that advocacy
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
continue during the um during the budget
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
process um going on to uh page two of
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
the bill the um um uh 594 does change
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the plan design from a uh from
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
100% upfront to 20% of the grant upfront
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining paid over 20 year
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
um 20 years of equal payments and uh the
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
reason for this change is to tackle the
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
really the extensive uh project backlog
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
the projects that are in the pipeline a
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
lot of it due to the moratorium um and
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh and also recognizing that that the
 
00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
state Grant doesn't cover everything on
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
the project so um so you know it's very
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
likely that that most projects are going
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
to require districts to go out and get a
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
bond anyway so uh so the 20 years of
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
equal payments um helps to temper the uh
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
the effect of um of The Debt Service on
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
School District budgets um another uh uh
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
thing that's done on page two down
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom is um is directing
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
the State Board to adopt rules and um
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's important important
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
because um the uh you know statutes are
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
really really to be templates for uh for
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh for Ru making and um and in the uh in
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
the existing statute there's there's
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
pages of of minutia rules which uh which
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
will which are which are repealed uh in
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
this and um uh but General guidelines
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
are um are are offered in 594
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
specifically guidelines surrounding
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
safety and indoor air quality so so I
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
think those are those are certainly
 
00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
things that um um uh that need to be
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
considered during during project uh
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
planning um on page
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
three um uh we address some uh we we
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
actually address applicability of the
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
building aid program to projects that
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
were started or completed during the
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
moratorium years so obviously school
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
districts couldn't hold their breath and
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
tread water or tread water the whole the
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
whole time
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
while uh while while buildings required
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance and upgrades um uh so um uh
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
so you know we that it would this would
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
extend the um the building aid program
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
for a year to be able for these
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
districts to be able to uh to apply for
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
some um uh some
 
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
relief page
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
four um has um has a couple of um um
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
minor changes um uh just make sure yeah
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
minor changes to it um uh but but the
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
formula is is the same is is exactly the
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
same formula that the doe determines for
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
rating um uh or determining the uh the
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
grant uh that would come from the state
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
but it does add a reporting requirement
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
that I think lines up very well with
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
what chairman lad just uh just talked
 
00:22:53.549 --> 00:22:53.559 align:start position:0%
about in terms of the um the the
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
correlation between student outcomes and
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh and building quality so so so this
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
would put some requirements on the
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
department to um uh to look at
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
improvements in buildings and look at uh
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
how that um U analyze how that may have
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
affected student outcomes in those
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
districts and Reporting uh those um
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
having those reports available to the
 
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
chairs of the uh the House and Senate
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
education committees um and then and
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
then really the last part on this on
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
page five um is um uh is where we we
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
propose to expand the grant range to
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
better align with the fiscal capacity
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we see U that towns and
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities have across our state and
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
um and uh with the with the chair's uh
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
permission and Indulgence I was
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
wondering if Jen could Gen 4 could um
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
could uh could share uh just a a sort of
 
00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
a quick spreadsheet that illustrates um
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity range that we we see
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
state so so thanks thanks very much Miss
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
Miss for um uh this is this is just a
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
quick spreadsheet it's based on
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
equalized property values from um uh
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
from Dr and doe data back in
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
fy19 um and it sorted from the lowest
 
00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
property values down to the highest
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
property vales and I didn't plug in all
 
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
of the U the the grant determinations
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Clark is going to be talking
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
about that next but you can see where
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
you've got you've got communities that
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
have very low property values per pupil
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
like Claremont and Berlin who were under
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
current law getting uh getting a a 60%
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh project Grant from the state under
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
594 that would go up to 80% and you can
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
see how that also affects you know other
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
towns you know here on the um the the
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
the low side of um of equalized proper
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
property value per pupil so towns like
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
Charlestown and Newport would see um
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
pretty noticeable increases in um in
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
their their Grant eligibility from the
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
state um hail's in there too and um and
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
if we just sort of scroll down you you
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
can also see how how you've got property
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
values equalized valuations in the
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
400,000 500,000 600,000 so now we're
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
going up we're getting towns that are
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
starting to have a little more capacity
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
Franklin seasoning increase 60% to a 75%
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
Grant and and we keep going down here um
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
I wanted to put Manchester in here
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
because obviously that's the biggest
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
school district in the state 13,000 kids
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
almost a million dollars in um in
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
equalized property value they would see
 
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
an increase so now we're and we keep
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
keep scrolling down now we're sort of
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
getting into the average the state
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
average of equalized property value per
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
pupil and so and you know we all know
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
this because this is the this is the
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
property value that generates the local
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
property tax revenue that's used to fund
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
schools so now we're right at the
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
average here 1.1 million dollars or so
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
so there's probably you know not not so
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
much of a change in terms of the grants
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
that uh that these communities would be
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh would be getting for uh for building
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
Aid uh and we keep going so now we're
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
now we're into the $2 million so um and
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and now we're now we're really sort
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
of coming down to the to the bot of the
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
chart and you can see like New London um
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
would see its Grant reduced from 30% the
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
the current the current range is 30% to
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
60% the proposed range is 20% to 80% so
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing seeing the grant
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
reduced in in for some of these
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have um uh higher uh
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity and um and you can see
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
you've got Molton buror and Newcastle
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
and Waterville Valley uh where it's
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
starting to go down to 25% % and then
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
20% for um for Newcastle which you know
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
has over um has over $10 million in
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
property value per pupil so you're
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
really seeing a grant range not you're
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
seeing really full use of a of a grant
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
range but you're also seeing the um the
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
disparity across the state in terms of
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity and being able to raise
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
local tax dollars to uh to fund these
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
building projects I mean we started back
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
in you know 4505 $100,000 and now we're
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
looking at I mean per pupil in property
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
valuation and now we're looking at over
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
$10 million um so you know you're
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
getting that 5 10 20x range in um in
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity and I'm not saying
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
expanding it from 20% to 60 from um 30
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
to 60% expanding that to 20 to
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
80% meets all of that need but I think
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
it certainly puts it in a better
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
Direction and um and as Miss Clark is
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
going toh going to lay out for us um um
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't doesn't really change
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
how the uh the the the total spend would
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
be um the total cost of the state would
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
be but it would be done in a more
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
um in a in a manner that really uh helps
 
00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
to address the uh the needs and the
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
capacity of our of our towns so that's
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
what I have from um um members of the
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your time and
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
and chair lad is is there anything um
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
you'd like to add on to
 
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519 align:start position:0%
this well in regard to uh this
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
particular I'm not going to comment on
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know any of the you know specific
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
elements within however we do have a
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
huge disparity if you're looking at if
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
you looked at the next the the uh eiz
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
property valuations based on the
 
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.669 align:start position:0%
property valuations based on the
220

00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
220
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
20-21 membership uh and that's ABM it's
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
not including
 
00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
utilities um you have the lowest uh
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
equalized is North umberland with $
 
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.389 align:start position:0%
equalized is North umberland with $
37,9

00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
37,9
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
43 and then the maximum is millsfield
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
which has 93
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
m616 420 per pupil huge discrepan
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
discrepan discrepancies throughout the
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
state and this is making it very
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
difficult for for our
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
districts to come up with the bonding
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
levels necessary to support a bond to
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
take up the difference there between
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
what the state provides and no State
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide I'll hold any more of
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
these comments till um we finish with uh
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
Education great so uh chair lad and I
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
will certainly be happy to take
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
questions after um Miss Clark um uh
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
so and um Miss for we can probably um
 
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:26.230 align:start position:0%
so and um Miss for we can probably um
yeah

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
good morning are you ready for me did
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
you say this is okay so uh good morning
 
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
chairman lad and committee members for
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Amy Clark and I am
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
the administrator for the school safety
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
and facility management Bureau at the
 
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I am I have some
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
handouts that I uh forwarded to you the
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
other day that I'm gonna going I'm going
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
to go over but I'm really here for any
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
technical assistance I'm here for you so
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
if you have questions or want more

information about anything I'm here to
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
um support that so um I think it
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
probably is best for me to go over my
 
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
handouts uh would you I can share my
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
screen if you would like would that be
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
helpful to folks or would you like to
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
will share the
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
screen yeah I think I have privileges so
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give it a second for it to
 
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
pop up and you let me know I got a
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
thumbs up that you can see it so um this
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
um was handed out in your email if you
 
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
um didn't get it just let me know but um
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
I believe that um I've heard that some
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
folks did so this is a 19-page document
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
I will not go over it all I will briefly
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
skim it if you want to talk about
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
anything specific we can always go back
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
and talk about it in detail um I already
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
spoke with you all earlier last month
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
and so items 1 through four in this
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
packet you have already seen and we've
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
already discussed um and items 5 through
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
seven are a little bit more um specific
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
to to this bill that I thought might be
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
helpful um I have a second addendum
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
package that uh Miss for uh forwarded to

me uh this page this is page one uh well
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
page two and it is just the a one-page
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
summary of the school building aid
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
program it has the law is in RSA
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
19815 and the supporting doe regulations
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
are in Ed 320 1 the very Basics are
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
School building Aid is state aid to
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
support local school districts and
 
00:33:06.029 --> 00:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
meeting the costs of constructing
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
constructing or reconstructing school
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
buildings I'd like to remind people that
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
school building Aid is for large
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
projects we're not talking about um re
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
putting in a new floor we're not talking
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
about redoing the roof we're talking
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
about a large renovation project in
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
order for it to qualify for building Aid
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh another thing there are not
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance projects
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
um these are actual construction large
 
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.549 align:start position:0%
um these are actual construction large
construction

00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
projects uh as already said the range is
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
30 currently 30 to 60% I'd like to just
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
point out that the average rate is 38% I
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
think that that's important especially
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you all are considering widening that
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
range the average rate floats around 38
 
00:33:49.799 --> 00:33:51.870 align:start position:0%
range the average rate floats around 38
to

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
39% um School construction the
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
dispersement is also important to to
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
note because House Bill 594 changes that
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
the current dispersement the way
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
building 8 is paid is currently uh well
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
prior to 2013 schools the state paid on
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
the term of a bond over the course of 20
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
years for example it depends on the term
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
of the bond but your Grant was paid as
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
the percent that you that you saw on
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
that list for your principal payment in
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
your bond it did not cover interest
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
payment so in the end you were still
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
getting that percent rate based on the
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
principle of your bond over that course
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
of the term in 2013 that was changed so
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
that the department only makes two
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
payments two instead of a payment every
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
year for 20 years once 2013 regulations
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
came into play it changed that to only
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
be two payments it would pay
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
80% of your of the district's award
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
upfront not an 80% award it wouldn't
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
cover 80% of the project what's that
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
saying is 80% of whatever your award was
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
would be paid upfront 20% upon
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
completion that is what the current law
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
states brief history again not going
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
over at all 1946 to
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
2007 uh building Aid was appropriated to
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
meet the demand of the applications
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
received in 20 2008 was the first sign
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
of building Aid getting a little
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
uncertain with funding there was a
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
shortfall in 2010 the state took out a
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
bond to cover um those obligated funds
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
that we had to pay on the bonds that we
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
were paying for the past construction
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
projects and officially House Bill 2
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
imposed a two-year moratorium on new
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
projects that new that two-year
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
moratorium um was repeated for for two
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
years repeatedly until the the current
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
bium that we're in the current bium that
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're in is the first bium fcal 20 and
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
21 the first bium that we have not had a
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
moratorium since it was in
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
place and again that moratorium was
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited the Department of Education
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
for funding new projects the moratorium
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
ended and for the first time building
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
Aid was funded fully in fiscal year
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
2020 um and in 2021 it was partially
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
funded uh so moving on to page three of
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
the handout it's real quickly just talks
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
about the changes that happened in 2013
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
in leg legis legislative changes in
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
2013 the key one to remember especially
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
for this bills these bills are that in
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
2013 there W wasn't a cap prior and then
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
in 2013 the cap um language was put in
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
to cap that at $50 million per year
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
year uh let's see again I know that
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
you've seen all of these before in my
 
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.990 align:start position:0%
you've seen all of these before in my
prior

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.309 align:start position:0%
prior
presentation

00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
but um let's see can
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
I there we
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
go so this is that building Aid tail
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
graph um this is just something handy I
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
like to have all the time because people
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
school districts are always asking me
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
how much money might be available and I
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
start by saying well if building a is
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
fully funded then this fiscal 22 and
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
23 $32 million would be available for
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
new projects during the bium and I can
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
take you through this again but I'm
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to leave that to you to to let me
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
know if you want me to do this just note
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
here um that if you look um here is the
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
obligated funds or the total debt
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
service is 35 million for 2022
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
and 32 million for fiscal year
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
2023 those are the payments that are
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
paying on past projects and the state
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
bond that totals 35 million and 32
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
million for the next two years that
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're budgeting for if building Aid were
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
funded at 50
 
00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
million then there would be 15 million
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
for new projects and 188 million for new
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
projects the second year of the vium
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
um you can't read this on my screen
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
likely magic of that I could zoom in but
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
really I just want you to note that
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
these are the project applications that
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
are applying for aid for fiscal 22 and
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
23 there are 12 projects here their
 
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
total construction costs uh their total
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
cost of their projects is
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
$270 million the state aid uh if
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
building Aid were funded would equate to
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
$104 million if all of those projects
 
00:39:01.359 --> 00:39:03.670 align:start position:0%
$104 million if all of those projects
were

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
funded and that's for a two-year period
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
so 104 let's in ball ballpark that and
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
just say you know that is average of 50
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
million for those new Pro for each year
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
for those projects um page
 
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.309 align:start position:0%
for those projects um page
six

00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:39:19.319 --> 00:39:20.910 align:start position:0%
six
through

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
11 are um just if you want to look up
 
00:39:27.309 --> 00:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
and you're curious to see oh how much um
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
is the state currently paying on past
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
projects for Interlakes well then you
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
can see the Department of Education is
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
still paying um
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
$115,000 to Interlakes I can see that
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
we're not paying them in
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
2023 which means that this is our last
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
payment and that project is going to be
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
one more payment and we've completed
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
that it's likely that that was a
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
probably 20 years ago that that project
 
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
started it could have had a TW 10-year
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
bond though so that's just an
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
example and scrolling through all the
 
00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
way those are for all the
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
districts um on page 12 so this is new I
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
think this might be the first time that
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
you've seen this or in your packet um
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
this takes and looks at the current
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
building Aid rate in the current
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
law and Compares it to the changes made
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
by House Bill
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
594 representative luno already walked
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
you through some of the comparisons with
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity and the rates but
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
here it is if you want to look it up by
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
town but it's alphabetized by
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
town and at the bottom of this list is
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
the regional Cooperative
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
districts if you're looking about
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
districts so keep in mind that let's say
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
marac Valley March Valley is not a town
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
but it accepts students from multiple
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
towns so how the current law works and
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
there's no change to that and how it's
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
calculated um in the proposed law but
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
how that works is it's the the towns are
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
weighted by the number of students that
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
attend that school district so marac
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
Valley would use all the different towns
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
that go there Salsbury Lowden um
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
Penacook and so forth and so you can see
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
the changes in those districts um with
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
that last column you can see the change
 
00:41:27.069 --> 00:41:27.079 align:start position:0%
in their rates
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
so in on page 15 of your
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
handout um let's see how to best look at
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
this one on page 15 of your handout I'd
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
like to stress that well this is a list
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
of projects that were built during the
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
moratorium that may have been covered by
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
building Aid had building Aid been
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
available I want to stress a couple of
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
things about this list this is an
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
informal data collection it was
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
collected the vast majority of this data
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
was collected in a survey 2016 survey
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
that we did um along the way we would
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
hear of other other schools might say oh
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
we just completed a project and I would
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
write it down and it would and it would
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
come into this list um this isn't a
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
formal application or anything like that
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
the um if House Bill 594 were to pass
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
and cover retro projects we would have
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
to develop a formal application uh but I
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
just want to note that this is not a
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
formal list um for
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
example there are some renovation
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
projects on here that I don't know
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
because I haven't seen their project
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
whether it would qualify for substantial
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
renovation which is um defined in the
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
law so just want to keep in mind that it
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
is an informal data collection um I also
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
want to point out that there could be
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
other districts that have built during
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
the moratorium that the state does not
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
know about since they don't need state
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
aid they don't come through my office so
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
I have no way of knowing how much those
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
projects would cost but the story of
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
this list is this last line and just so
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
that you know this an estimated list is
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
$530 Million worth of construction
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
projects that were built during the
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
moratorium without state aid if they had
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
applied for Aid using today's
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
rates uh the building Aid rates that
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
would have been1 182 million
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
estimated of building Aid the proposed
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 594 doesn't propose to give
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
them that it proposes to um give a flat
 
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
rate of 20% to all those projects built
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
moratorium another key point of this
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
handout is that if you were to take all
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
these projects I didn't actually add
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
them up sorry about that I don't know
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
how much this number is but the average
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
number the average project here is $1
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
million it might be important to kind of
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
scan through this list and see all these
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
30% um rates here as well certainly um
 
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh Hillsboro daring Cooperative was able
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
to get an A $1.2 Million uh $2 million
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
project pass but for the most part these
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
are um more affluent communities um if
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
that's of um interest you can see middle
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
Middleton also um constructed as well so
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's that and
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
then um the last part page 16 through
 
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
19 I just if this is all we really have
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
for facility conditions is in
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
2016 I conducted a Survey Monkey uh as
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
fancy as I got um of for schools on
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
their their condition of their building
 
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
um some states um do a formal needs
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
assessment or a condition there's
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
actually uh an index called a facility
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
condition index an FCI it's a formal
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
condition index um done by engineers and
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
um that's not what we did we did not
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
spend Millions we just um did a survey
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
so I want to point that out I sent this
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
to school districts I had them ask them
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
about their condition of their
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
facilities I got a fairly good response
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
rate for a volunteer survey of about
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
65% in this survey some of you have
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
already touched on it but um our schools
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
some of our schools are very old we have
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
6% that responded were built prior to
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
1900 26% of our schools that responded
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
to the survey were built prior than to
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
1950 I won't go over all of these but
 
00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:56.839 align:start position:0%
the the gist is is we have some pretty
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
old schools out there um 60% built more
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
than 50 years ago and and remember this
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
survey is now five years old as well um
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
again not going to read through all of
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
these you have them in your handout this
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
one is on minimum minimum size 177%
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
don't say they don't meet the um
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
educational um minimum
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
requirements um 5% are using four or
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
more Portables I think the take-home
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
message here is that 85% of our schools
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
are not using Portables uh we would we
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
would see a sign of a portable as being
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
a temporary condition and um Portables
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
are not something that is that are used
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
for long term certainly not used for 50
 
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
years you are not using a portable
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
classroom or shouldn't be using a
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
portable classroom safety wise for for
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
50 years um but I just point out that
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
85% of our schools are not using
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
Portables that to me sounds like really
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
good news
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind that building Aid has
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
been funded from in the 40s all the way
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
through um the um in 2008 or 2010 when
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
the official moratorium started so
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's good you know we um moratorium
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
was um put in and and we have U more and
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
more schools that are
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
um that are having to put in Portables
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
um to cover those space
 
00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:24.710 align:start position:0%
um to cover those space
needs

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.390 align:start position:0%
needs
um

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
again I won't read through all of these
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
this is just really um talking about
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
other than Portables do you have art on
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
a cart are you trying to use spaces that
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
are really not real spaces to conduct
 
00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.390 align:start position:0%
are really not real spaces to conduct
your

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
education talks to that and on the
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
bottom of these slides you can see these
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
are just comments that were pulled out
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
in 2016 these are not my words these are
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
just comments in the comment section I
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
thought well this sort of is interesting
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
so I pulled it out um overall condition
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
of facilities these are the the school
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
districts reporting these facility
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
conditions and again you can't probably
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
read this slide but you might be able to
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
read it in your handout again these are
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
just comments that I thought were
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
interesting um so you could read through
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
those and that is again the school
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
districts reporting themselves on
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
whether they think they're good adequate
 
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.109 align:start position:0%
whether they think they're good adequate
or

00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
Fair um I could I'm going to stop share
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
and I actually have a second document to

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
first and open

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
apparently are you able to see this uh

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
see okay I'm actually sharing my sharing
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
this a different way for some reason it
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to come up but I can share
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
my screen and drag it over here so um if
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
I can get a thumbs up from somebody that
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
they can see my screen thank you very
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
much um this is just three pages this is
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
the additional handout that I um had um
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
sent over yesterday u based on some
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
questions that I thought might come up
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
um I figured I would throw in a couple
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
more slides um mostly this slide I guess
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
that's as big as I can get it hopefully
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
you have your handout or you can see
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
screen this is um I maybe ideally um
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
some states spend um a few million
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
dollars on um the doing A needs
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
assessment of what do their schools need
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
the state does not have a program like
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
that so this is a backof the envelope
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
calculation simply based on the current
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
law and statist uh numbers that we can
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
get like statistics
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
so on we have about so this is a an a
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
space assessment how much space does the
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
state have in school facilities um out
 
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
there and what might it cost to build or
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
rebuild these schools every 40 to 50
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
years so the there are
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
450 schools in public schools in New
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about there's about
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
168,000 K through 12 students note that
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
building Aid only covers K through 12
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
spaces there are of course more and more
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
preschool um students in schools but
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
building a does not cover their spaces
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
so if a building aid application is
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
received preschool is prated out of that
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
calculation and not covered so that's
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
168,000 K through 12u
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
students I'm going to skip a bullet um
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
the average cost um the average square
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
foot allowance in the law is 140 sare
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
feet per student it depends on how many
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
students you have bigger schools smaller
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
schools it depends on if your elementary
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
high but on average it's 140 square feet
 
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.910 align:start position:0%
high but on average it's 140 square feet
per

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
per
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
student of the 12 applications received
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 22 and
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
23 only one school is right at that
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
square footage per
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
student uh the other all the other
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
schools are greater than this square
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
footage which means that that as local
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars not State Building Aid
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
that would cover those spaces but I just
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
want to make that point that special
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
education spaces are increasing more and
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
more and those square footage is not
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
what typically schools are building but
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
it is what the cap in the law is so if
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
you take 140 square feet per
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
student and you multiply that by
 
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.549 align:start position:0%
student and you multiply that by
168,000

00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
168,000
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
students you get
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
23.5 million square
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
feet so what that is essentially saying
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
is that the state has for State Building
 
00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.870 align:start position:0%
is that the state has for State Building
Aid

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.430 align:start position:0%
Aid
purposes

00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
23.5 million square feet to take care of
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to debate whether the state
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
should be taking care of it or the local
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I'll leave that to you all
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
legislators but I will just say that
 
00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's 23.5 million square feet that of
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
public school spaces out there based on
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
what is allowed by the law um many
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
schools are closer to 200 square feet
 
00:53:14.829 --> 00:53:14.839 align:start position:0%
per student we're seeing um if they have
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
um it also does not cover CTE spaces
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
because the CTE program is covered
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
different in a separate program so um
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
the average cost for a construction for
 
00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
a project is about $300 a square foot um
 
00:53:40.109 --> 00:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
don't use this as a state certainly
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't use this to argue with with with
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
your current construction project
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
because there are some construction
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
projects that are larger uh than this
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
$300 per square foot and some that are
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
that are lower than this $300 per square
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
foot but this is a rough average um that
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
so if you take $300 a square foot and
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
multiply it by 23.5 million square feet
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
billion if you assume that a school is
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
going to be rebuilt or have a
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
substantial renovation project over all
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the square footage over their
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
building you're looking at 100 76
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
million per year again not here to argue
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
about who pays for that I'm just here to
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
say that that is what the needs of an
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
average square footage is um if for
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
example the state covered on average 30%
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
that would equate to $53 million a year
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
currently the law puts their average
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
rate about 40% remember I said it was
 
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
like 38
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
39% um the the proposed changes in House
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 594 are right about that same range
 
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
even though it's it broadens it from 20
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
to 80% the average still is about the
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
same and it is right around 40% that
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
would average out to be $70 million per
 
00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
year um I don't think anybody is going
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
to discuss today whether we should be
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
paying 60% of everybody's costs but if
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
so that would be $106 million per year I
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
just put those out there for numbers for
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
you to see um um I also just want to
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
make a strong note that this is for
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
construction and reconstruction costs
 
00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
this is not maintenance costs when
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
typically over the life of a building
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
50% of your costs are for the building
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
itself and 50% of costs are are
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the building which means
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
they're equal what I'm trying to say is
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
they're equal your Capital costs and
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
your maintenance costs um are typically
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh that's a nationwide um uh number
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
anyway on the what should be
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
covered so um just with that said for
 
00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
example a roof a roof is a great
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance cost that does not covered
 
00:56:09.789 --> 00:56:09.799 align:start position:0%
by building Aid it used to be a long
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
time ago but it is not anymore and so um
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance would be um not qualified
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
for building Aid okay so I spent a lot
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
of time on that slide but I don't need
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
to spend any time on this slide this is
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
just a summary of that 2016 survey um
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
just summarize that all those six pages
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
I thought was a lot so here's a summary
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
of what some of that says about the age
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
buildings um odds and ends I just want
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
to remind you all that if you hear the
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
word Public School infrastructure fund
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh that is not school building Aid that
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
was uh $28 million of state aid for
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
secur mostly security projects and some
 
00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
Life Safety projects and some um fiber
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
bringing fiber connection to schools so
 
00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:56.200 align:start position:0%
that that fund expired in December of
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
2020 but the $28 million that um was
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
allocated to um security projects for
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
the most part CTE funding is also not
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
covered by school building Aid obviously
 
00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
a project might have a CTE space in it
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
and perhaps they'll get CTE funding for
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
it if they're up for that funding and
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
those costs are actually prated out on
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
building Aid you can't we can't pay
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
building Aid on those
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
spaces and then lastly this does not
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
cover lease spaces building Aid um
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
specifically doesn't cost call uh pay
 
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
for lease spaces there's a separate
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh called lease Aid that
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
pays 30% of Charter School leases up to
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
$30,000 and my slide I just want to
 
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
leave you with is that that what schools
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
are looking for again who pays for it
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not sure that's up to you
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
all but uh what schools are looking for
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
they're not looking for swimming pools
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
they're not looking for athletic turf
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
fields because those are not covered by
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
building Aid um what the building Aid is
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
looking for is working HVAC systems
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
clean air good water quality suitable
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
lighting good
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
Acoustics uh adequate instructional
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
spaces accessible spaces and uh a safe
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
place to learn as well as a place to
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
play and be active for our elementary
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
schools so with that I know there's a
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
information um but that's what I have
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions that
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
might um help you um make any decisions
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
or considerations today thank you thank
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
you wondering
 
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
if spond sponsors wanted to continue
 
00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:52.839 align:start position:0%
their testimony based
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
on and
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
I have nothing addition my
 
00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:01.230 align:start position:0%
I have nothing addition my
testimony

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
and I I do of course have questions on
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.390 align:start position:0%
 
gonna

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
person representative do know anything
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
to add before we move on to
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:26.039 align:start position:0%
part I'm not sure uh um I'm I couldn't
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
hear that I don't know about the other
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
viewers but I couldn't hear that I think
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
I can hear representative lad speak but
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
when somebody is speaking to him I'm not
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
able to hear him I don't know if he
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
could repeat the question
 
00:59:42.029 --> 00:59:42.039 align:start position:0%
Yesa you want to add your testimony
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
presentation

thank you very much um Mr chair for for
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
offering I I'm uh I I thought Miss Clark
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
U uh represented the the the current um
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
law current program as well as the
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
proposed uh changes uh very um
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
adequately great then uh we'll open up
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
the uh meeting questions for Miss CL
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
stting thank you very much Mr chair um
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
Miss Clark I have a question about the
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
20% of the building that happened during
 
01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
the moratorium is that 20% of the $530
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
million that you shared with us we got
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
off I did hear the question I did hear
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
the question so if you all can hear me
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
um I think I can answer so yes I I the
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
way I read the bill it it looks to say
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
that um it doesn't Define the term of
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
when that is paid whether it's a it's
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
paid over the course of a year or many
 
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
years but the way that I read the
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
current law it says that I'm not the
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
current law the proposed House Bill 594
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
is that it would look to cover
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
20% of that 500 or more or less million
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
dollars of projects okay and if I may
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
have a followup yes you may um so that
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
would be approximately $106 million over
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
whichever time period and um sort of as
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
an this side do you know what a fair
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
interest rate would be on these Debt
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
Service I I would guess 3% but I'm not
 
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
exactly sure um I don't know that I
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that question
 
01:02:13.279 --> 01:02:15.789 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that question
I'm

01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
chair did I hear someone yeah yeah yes I
 
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
just like to um add to that to to um to
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
question go ahead please um the um the
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
594 does uh does Pro it it it's it it
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
certainly is still left up to the
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
department to determine Grant Awards so
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
so just because you apply doesn't mean
 
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
you get selected by the department that
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
would apply for projects in the pipeline
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
as well as um
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
projects that were started or completed
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
during the moratorium period it also as
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
you've pointed out representative that
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
it does not specify the payment plan for
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
those projects that receive a grant
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
projects that were started or completed
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
during the moratorium period that
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
received that 20% Grant and and I think
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
that would be subject that's a perfect
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
place where the department can do rul
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
making on that because it could be that
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
there's um 12 years left or 15 years
 
01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
left on the um on on that District's um
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
um Bond payment and maybe that 20%
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
should be divided over 15 equal payments
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
to line up with that um maybe they want
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
it a different way um but I think that
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be U that would be subject that
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
would that's a good example where where
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh Department Ru making needs to have
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
some flexibility to deal with um um
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
specific needs that the districts could
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
have thank you follow up Sor yes if I
 
01:04:01.309 --> 01:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
may follow up uh thank you very much for
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
that it seems like you are very familiar
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
with these finding mechanisms is the 3%
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
rate of reasonable
 
01:04:07.599 --> 01:04:10.190 align:start position:0%
rate of reasonable
assumption

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
for I think it's a little lower than
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
that right now but but that's actually
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things that that
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
we've added in
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
594 at the top of page four to um uh to
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
to the report reports that the that the
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
committee should get from the um from
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
the Department uh so it would have it
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
would talk about Bond rates um current
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
and anticipated so so we'd have some
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
better resolution of that but my
 
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that Bond rates are are
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
very low right
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
now and um at the last followup if you
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
could check my assumptions here if I
 
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
take $20 million that spread over 20
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
years at a 3% rate that's roughly $1
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
million in debt service payments each
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
year for and then that would compound
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
year upon year do those numbers sound
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
right to you or or yeah I think I think
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
you're not talking about you know a
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
single project necessarily but um well
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
it could be um so so yes 20 million over
 
01:05:14.589 --> 01:05:14.599 align:start position:0%
20 years with a with a compounding
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
well the the bond rate would be paid by
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
the district the state cannot take out a
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
bond okay so it'll be a little bit
 
01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
underneath that so maybe for every $250
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
million the state is obligated their
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
obligation would be roughly a million
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
per year so 2 million a year obligation
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
for that in face 50 million so that's a
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
good chunk change thank you so much
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative M thank you Mr
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
Vice chair thank you M clar for your
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful presentation uh I want to
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
point out that representative Ron uh is
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
a former Wall Street data analyst and
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
and has a seems to have a great eye for
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
these num numers uh and I I have a
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
slightly different question for Miss
 
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
Park uh very simply uh if if you can
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
take a minute we have some newer reps
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
and also some folks watching uh at home
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
on on YouTube if you could take just a
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
minute or so and explain the process for
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
say School Breg in any Town New
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that meets and decides they
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
want to apply for assistance could you
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
just quickly describe the pro the
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
process how that works in the decision
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
making process for how any Aid may may
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
granted sure happy to do that so I think
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
the question was that you know what what
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
the current process is for somebody
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
seeking building Aid uh and essentially
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
that process would be that they have to
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
apply so they have to apply a year or
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
more in advance of knowing whether
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
there's going to be building Aid or not
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to say that is that is a
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
challenge for school districts um
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
because they are uncertain if building
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
Aid is going to be funded these fiscal
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 applicants applied in
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
20120 and they provided a full
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
application to be ranked by the
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Education typically that
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
ranking is um re viewed by in December
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
by the School building authority the
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
school building authority verifies the
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
Department's ranking and then it's
 
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
submitted to the State Board of
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
Education that list is approved
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
typically in January of the following
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
just before knowing what the state
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
budget is so in this case it would be
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
January of
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
2021 um that process by executive order
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
was bumped out but that's the this the
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
months were bumped out but that is the
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
standard um what's in the current law um
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
their rent ranked based on a ranking is
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
based on lots of different criteria
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
could uh overcrowding school safety
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
issues structural issues um Ada um
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
Corrections that they they might be
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
making educational deficiencies and so
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
forth I don't know if that answers your
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
question or not that's very thank you
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
welcome the uh further questions um from
 
01:08:20.199 --> 01:08:21.189 align:start position:0%
welcome the uh further questions um from
the

01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
committee I just have one if I might um
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
saw air quality list on on one your
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
sides is
 
01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:31.829 align:start position:0%
sides is
common

01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
renovation project and I believe Esser
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
one and two funds come into play
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
possibly with that could you explain
 
01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:44.759 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
allocated um I think representative
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
cordelli I'm not sure I heard all of
 
01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
your your question so I I'm going to try
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
to repeat it and answer it I think I
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
know what your question is but please
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
raise your hand or wave if that's not
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
what you wanted I think you were asking
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
about the Esser funds and how they might
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
support school facilities and indoor air
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
quality issues and so the SR funds I'm
 
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
not I I'm not the SR fund Grant manager
 
01:09:19.709 --> 01:09:19.719 align:start position:0%
so I I I have to um defer that a little
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
bit I I if Caitlyn Davis is on the phone
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
she could probably answer that
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
what I can say is that um the how they
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
might differ from building Aid is that
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
the SR funding covers facility U
 
01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
projects that would address indoor air
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
quality but I'm not familiar of how much
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
per school that would be and I can just
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
say indoor air uh uh HVAC systems are
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
expensive so when you're looking at s
 
01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
funds HVAC systems are hundreds of
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars depending on the
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
square footage of a building all the way
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
up to a million plus dollars so um I
 
01:09:59.550 --> 01:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
guess it would depend on the Esser funds
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
what they need them for and whether
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
they're apply but you are correct the SR
 
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
funds do have a criteria in them that
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
says that facilities can cover those
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
projects and I saw Caitlyn Davis's uh
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
face pop up but I'll turn that back over
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
to you representative lad sorry in
 
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
there you like to follow on question
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
so there is a lot of flexibility with
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
the SR 2 fund as opposed to the Sesser
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
One Fund which was distributed um in the
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
spring of 2020 sr2 was received by the
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education about three
 
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
weeks ago the Department of Education
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
put out preliminary allocations to
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
school districts on Friday um however
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
they have not been finalized and they
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
were in the process of being distributed
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
by the department there is certainly
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
some flexibility that um Air Quality
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
Systems could be an allowable use of
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
those funds however um you know it's
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
kind of limited by the amount of funds
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
that a certain School District receives
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
um some some school districts received
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
only a few hundred dollars even under
 
01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
sr2 which is a new $140 million package
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
some school districts like Manchester
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
received or are going to receive an
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
estimated $26 million so they are
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
semi-limited by the availability of the
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
funds um the
 
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
issue is I mean there's some fairly
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
complex construction standards that
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
school districts will be required to
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
follow if they choose to build um any
 
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
sort of um air quality system or
 
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
anything like that so um these are
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
actually relatively new regulations that
 
01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
the department will be dealing with we
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
haven't had uh funding that allows
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
Construction in the entire time that
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
I've been to the department I'm not sure
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
if ever I'm sorry Federal funding that
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
allows construction um so this is
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
something that we are in the process of
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
working through we are actively looking
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
to get more information from people who
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
are experts in using Federal funding
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
from um for construction but right now
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have um a great idea of who
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
projects I just follow up and ask there
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
will be a an application with
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
specifications from the local district
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
for the use of the allocated funds for
 
01:12:24.199 --> 01:12:25.669 align:start position:0%
for the use of the allocated funds for
that

01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:27.790 align:start position:0%
that
District

01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
um can you sorry can you repeat
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
um there will be an application process
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
of sorts for use of the allocated funds
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
from M Two by The District yeah so um
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
with all of our funds school districts
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
are required to provide an application
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education the
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
department of education's responsibility
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
is to review that application to make
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
sure that the activities are allowable
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
um so that will be no different from
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
this we can certainly um I can send Jen
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
for the list of allowable activities for
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
sr2 to distribute to the committee that
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
might be helpful for you all to have
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
you yes representative M thank you thank
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um the committee sees these
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
two individuals Caitlyn Davis and Amy
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
Clark as terrific representatives of the
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
department thank you very much I I just
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a comment that much of
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
this information was presented to the
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
commission on school funding and it was
 
01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
very clear from the commission that this
 
01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
addressed 594 does not deal with all of
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
the issues that are out there as school
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
funding but merely begins to address
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
parts of it so I would strongly
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
recommend the committee to support these
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
two bills because it it is sorely needed
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.030 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
okay are there further questions for
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
either Miss Davis or M Clark Mr chair oh
 
01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry no
 
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much Mr chair um and
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
while we have um Miss Clark um uh with
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
us uh you know I had some there little
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
bit of little bit of um um you know
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
cross talker feedback when um when
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon was was asking a
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
couple questions about the the program
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
design particularly for moratorium
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
projects and then the uh the bond
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
questions and I and I think the the the
 
01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
the bond Andor payment question should
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
have been directed to Ms Clark and I was
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if Miss Clark could um could
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
could take that up it had something to
 
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
do with the question about $20 million
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
time um do you have a quick answer to
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
that before we continue
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
that okay um so the I think just for
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
clarity I think the only clarification
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
um that I can make to what was said was
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
that the keep in mind that the state aid
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
is only on the principal Bond payment so
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's all I guess I would add I thought
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
that you did a good job explaining it um
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
it would be 20% uh you're you're correct
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Le that it it's 20% of
 
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
that big number the 500 million so yes
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
about $100 million and I think House
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 594 identifies that the uh
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would make rules
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
or at least to me it is not clear that
 
01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 594 States how that the term
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
of when that is paid um so I would
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
assume that the Department of Education
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
would have U make that Clarity in rules
 
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
but the only thing I would say is that
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
principal would be at the at I mean the
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
interest is covered by local taxpayers
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
currently and in The Proposal as
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
you sorry very very quickly I'm just
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this does that mean
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
that the 20% of those that ongoing
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
funding would just be um if you had A10
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
million loan you paid two million up we
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
had a two1 million paid construction
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
project 2 million was paid up front 8
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
million was spread split evenly over
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
those 20 years is it that simp simple of
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
math and then whatever cost of the bond
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
is is born by the towns or is it um so I
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
think there might be two two competing
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
things with house spill 594 the again
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
the way that I read it so there is a
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
retro for retro projects piece that's I
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
get I'm sorry I'm trying to talk about
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
the ongoing obligations I thank you I
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
could ask you questions all day but I
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to take everybody's time I'm
 
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.470 align:start position:0%
don't want to take everybody's time I'm
specifically

01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
ask your is there a question that this
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
about right um I think our next um has
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
to fire um is up and I wanted to thank
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
Miss Clark and M Davis for uh their time
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
and testimony and next call on
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
Marat

01:17:53.629 --> 01:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
Marat
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
um I assume everyone can hear me um this
 
01:18:01.229 --> 01:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
is uh representative Greg Hill I uh
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Northfield and
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
one-third of the city of
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
Franklin um I'm here to
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
testify I guess against uh both these
 
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
bills um in in a manner of cander um I
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
should let you know that while I am the
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
chair of the school building authority
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
which was mentioned earlier by uh Amy
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
Clark I am not here speaking as the
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
chair of the school building authority
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
um this is more as a um as a
 
01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
representative who's worked with this
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
for well since I've been appointed by
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council uh two years
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
ago or so um there were some a number of
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
things that were glossed over or not
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned at all that I would like uh
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
the committee to understand Dan
 
01:18:59.790 --> 01:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
um I am not uh as I say I'm not here
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
speaking against it I think maybe U this
 
01:19:05.629 --> 01:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
would be a good place for either a
 
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
retained bill um or uh something that uh
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
can be pushed off as um farther than
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
just making a decision in executive
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
session next week to uh to approve um I
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
think it's also important to point out
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
that um it is true as um honorable um
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
Dan Maguire told you last week that uh
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
the state has no money that it hasn't
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
first taken from the rest of us in terms
 
01:19:37.149 --> 01:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
of taxpayers so this idea that the state
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
has money and uh the local districts
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
have um money is um not withstanding
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
whatever I am putting forward here that
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
this is actually the same pair of pants
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
with just different pockets of money um
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with uh representative
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
luno um bill in one area and that is the
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
adjustment of percentages u based on
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation I think I think that
 
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
has Merit um and I certainly would
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
support that um in a in a further study
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I think it's fair to point out that
 
01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:21.639 align:start position:0%
um in neither representative lad or
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
presentation no mention was made of any
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
demographic studies or projections but U
 
01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
but it's clear that the commissioner of
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
education has said repeatedly that um
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a somewhere 20%
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in in population over the next
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh I think he said decade or two decades
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
um that that affects this greatly um and
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
yet there was no mention about that I
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
think it's also important to point out
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
that um there are going to be changes to
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
how brick and mortar um buildings are
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
are done in the near future all you have
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
to do is look and see how many shopping
 
01:21:11.229 --> 01:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
malls are being built um almost none and
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
and they're taken down um we are moving
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
further and further to more um virtual
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
spaces than we are brick and mortar
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
buildings and and it shouldn't be that
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings don't uh or or lag
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
40 and 50 years behind that Trend um it
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
seems that it needs to be addressed and
 
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be in at least in consideration
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
for any of these these longer year
 
01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
projects um we also did not mention um
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know right now the current situation
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh with pandemic and we have uh
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
um how many of these schools aren't even
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh occupied at all um and I'm not
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
willing to guess next year what's
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
happening let alone what's going to
 
01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
happen 20 years from now with these same
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
buildings um I think that's important to
 
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
put on the table um it's also important
 
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
to put on the table that um that school
 
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
buildings are a little different um for
 
01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:18.470 align:start position:0%
buildings are a little different um for
one

01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
thing there is state aid for school
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
buildings currently
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
um we have other municipal buildings um
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
fire and safety buildings for instance
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
in our
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and and no one is um at
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
least maybe I'm letting the cat out of
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
the bag no one is uh is promoting that
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
there should be state aid for uh fire
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
and safety buildings and yet you know I
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
can't come up with a good reason why
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
that is um maybe there should be a uh a
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
municipal building authority um instead
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
of a School building authority um it is
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
um also a point here that was not
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
brought up there are two sections to
 
01:23:05.229 --> 01:23:05.239 align:start position:0%
school building Aid um the only one that
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
was that was mentioned and highlighted
 
01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
and is always highlighted is the grant
 
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
side of school building Aid um there is
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
an entire other section which is um
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
based on um using the uh government
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
um Bond credit
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
rating um so schools can apply to use
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the states Bond rating um and and in
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
some cases I'm not saying I have no idea
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
what the numbers are but uh but very few
 
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
schools ever apply and I don't know
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
during the
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
moratorium that that was not part of the
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium so school buildings did have
 
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to apply to use the State's
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
bond rating and thereby lower their
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
overall costs um I don't have the
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
information on that but it would be an
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
interesting um study it occurred to me
 
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
while uh we were talking about U
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
retroactively paying for projects that
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
were uh undertaken during the
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
moratorium um so it may be that we are
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually paying for well that's not
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
government money uh that's not State
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
money I should say it is merely used
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
using the the State's bond rating to to
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
make that
 
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.189 align:start position:0%
make that
happen

01:24:30.189 --> 01:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
um are really a little bit over the time
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
limit now we're we're sliding into our
 
01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
next hearing we still have some folks
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
could you wrap it up quickly please yes
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
I can um I wanted to get into the meat
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
of of the individual um cases that we
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
have before us now as you can tell the
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
um there's more to be done with the
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
process of this than the money um it is
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
typical that um that we're trying to
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
throw money at a problem to solve it but
 
01:25:02.189 --> 01:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you the process for this
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
school building Aid is ridiculously poor
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
um the timing as Amy Clark pointed out
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
you've got two to apply two years in
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
advance what's important for the board
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
to know or the committee to know is very
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
often the voters in that Community have
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
not yet um weigh in on whether to
 
01:25:27.109 --> 01:25:27.119 align:start position:0%
approve or disapprove this
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
project prior to um all of this work by
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
Amy Clark and everyone else um actually
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
having to evaluate the project um it's
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely ridiculous it cries out
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
for a summer project for somebody here
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
um I would of the projects that we have
 
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:49.719 align:start position:0%
right now I'll give you two quick
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
numbers um so Amy spoke of the $104
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
million that if it's fully funded it
 
01:25:57.790 --> 01:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
would be paid
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
for um by the state of that
 
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
57 somewhere between 57 and 71 million
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the 104 million um is going to be
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
built regardless of building
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
a I'll repeat that 104 million total is
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
the obligation that we're looking at now
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
57 to 7 1 million of those projects are
 
01:26:27.109 --> 01:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
going to be built regardless of whether
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
building Aid is is approved or not um
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
there's also another um 12 million that
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
they're they're just setting aside the
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
project um some of that is in my own
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
community that they have no intention
 
01:26:47.109 --> 01:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
this year of building um because some of
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers have changed their
 
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
demographics have changed they've got
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
two new studies they've changed so not
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
all of this is a carved in
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
stone um fixed look at the at the money
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
it moves it it's fungible um so in that
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
case I guess I'll wrap up the rest of it
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
there is much more to this story than
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
just adding more money to the project
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
and and with that um I will end my
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm happy to take questions
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:23.950 align:start position:0%
 
time

01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for representa
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
Hill I have a question Mr chair yes go
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
ahead uh I guess I I am concerned about
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hill's
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
comments because if you listen to the
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
governor if you listen to the parents
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
there's a human outcry to return to
 
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
schools in buildings not
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
remote and secondly I'm not aware of any
 
01:27:51.719 --> 01:27:53.189 align:start position:0%
remote and secondly I'm not aware of any
state

01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
requirement of this I'm gonna my
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
question is this I'm not I'm not aware
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
of any requirement from the state to
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
provide funds for
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
firehouses however I am con I am aware
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
of requirement for the state to help
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
fund schools am I incorrect in
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you for your question
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative Miler no that's exactly
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
what my point was um we we have we seem
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
to handle municipal buildings
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
differently thank you there is there is
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
no requirement for fire and safety um
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
and yet there is for schools yes but uh
 
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
that was my point and that's my point
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
mine as well as far as the other um
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
position on or your other question um it
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
it escapes me at this point I can't
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
remember what you were talking about
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much are there
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.590 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
Hill

01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
W thank you Mr chairman uh very quick
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hill at you when you
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
started your dialogue you indicated that
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
you thought that the school building
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
construction similar to uh private
 
01:29:13.149 --> 01:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
construction for uh malls and things uh
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
in the future would be less brick and
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
water and so I guess what is your
 
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion is your implication there
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
that you see in the next 10 years or 20
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
years that public education going to be
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
remote uh thank you for your question
 
01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
representative um I don't think I don't
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
think I would be comfortable predicting
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
next week what's going to happen with
 
01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
any of this stuff um who who would have
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
thought a year ago that we would be in
 
01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
the position we are right now so um you
 
01:29:47.109 --> 01:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
know the idea that we're we're
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
obligating the state and the state
 
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the local taxpayers for
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
um what what this entire school project
 
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
looks like 20 years from now seems um
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
seems crazy is in light of the fact that
 
01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're not taking into account our
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
current conditions that's all that was
 
01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
my only point Thank you further
 
01:30:13.109 --> 01:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you very
 
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
much representative Hill thank you have
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.639 --> 01:30:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
home

01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
to can you hear us represent K Hill oh
 
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
sorry uh is it my opportunity to
 
01:31:02.109 --> 01:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
testify thank you so much thank you so
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
much uh and I would like to share my
 
01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
screen here if I may and I know that we
 
01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
were all interested in and getting kids
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
back in person and unfortunately uh we
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
had an experience here in New Market
 
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
we've been able to have uh iners and
 
01:31:19.709 --> 01:31:19.719 align:start position:0%
remote but we had uh a student and a
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
teacher a student uh exposed and tested
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
positively and so they've had a lot of
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
contact with the teacher and other
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
students so today we're remote only but
 
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
let me get to my
 
01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.830 align:start position:0%
let me get to my
presentation

01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
um right so uh as you know Mr chairman I
 
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
did sign in to hb214 because it's better
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
than nothing which is what we've done so
 
01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
far and all the years that I've been in
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
the house and I know you've been working
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
on this before that um I strongly
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
support HB 594 because it addresses
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
project projects undertaken under the
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
moratorium which had stopped funding but
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
not time deterioration overcrowding or
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
obsolesence affecting many schools in
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
our state uh the state should serve as a
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
reliable partner with property taxpayers
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
and our communities as we invest in
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
schools to assure students their
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
families and businesses considering New
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that education is a priority
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
HP4 594 would also make adjustments to
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
Grant percentages as determined by the
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
economics of the district putting a bit
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
more where where there was less ability
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
to fund these projects failure to invest
 
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
in state funds leaves communities with
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
no good options projects are delayed
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
costs increase and students are
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
adversely affected over time conditions
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
become untenable and property taxpayers
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
are forced to fund the entire cost yet
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
another downshifting from the state to
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
local property taxes I begin with what
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
I'm most familiar with the struggles in
 
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
my own town New Market however we are
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
certainly not alone in this effort to
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
provide education yes sir I'm getting to
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
it I know I'm reading to it here's
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
here's what we had here's what we were
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
working with uh this you see this
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
collection of uh of additions so we
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
started in 1925 added something in the
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
50s then in the 60s and then we skipped
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
the 70s and wait till the 80s to add a
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
new gy that's this before picture uh
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
students 6 through
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
12 now we found two New Hampshire
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
companies wonderful companies bwell
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
Architects and ecan construction who
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
found a way to reconfigure the existing
 
01:33:25.109 --> 01:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
and add 40% more space to that Junior
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
Senior High School we had that and the
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
space and the new modern air filtering
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh enabled us to offer in person uh to
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
me to more students than would have been
 
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
possible otherwise but you see we we
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
we've grown the building we found a way
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
to do it and here's the uh at the
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
elementary school we were we 30 years
 
01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
ago we had we had to in add modular
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
classrooms because we had this bump in
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh enroll
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
which we need students we need kids and
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
you know 30 years later which is longer
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
than modulars are designed for we were
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
able to uh add real classrooms we were
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
able to um add a proper size gymnasium
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
and then use this space that had been
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria SL gym to which have a
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
proper kitchen and proper cafeteria we
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
no longer have five lunch classes uh
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
lent sessions so we've done that but
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
what did it cost it cost $9 million and
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
who paid for it New Market property
 
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and we're still paying for it
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
an extra 315 per thousand on our already
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
rate so uh what I'm getting to is that
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
um right now that we had the moratorium
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
we couldn't wait there's lots of other
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
places that couldn't wait uh page 15 of
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
the handout that uh Amy Clark provided
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
is that list and that list will grow if
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
we don't fund School building Aid get do
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
get started doing something and I would
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
like to see those on that list
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
retroactively helped just to the extent
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
possible so that we can be the better
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
state that we should be provide the
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
education that our students and our
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
families and yes our businesses uh are
 
01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:10.360 align:start position:0%

2017 which you know that was in support
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
of another bill which didn't get very
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
far so I'm hoping that uh this will lead
 
01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
to a change so that we can we can

01:36:25.229 --> 01:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh chairman lad uh
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
for the record my name's Gary Abbott I'm
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
the Executive Vice President of the
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my testimony will be brief
 
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
because I've testified on this
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
legislation in the past I also have been
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist for many many years even
 
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
before the moratorium some 10 years ago
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
um the school building Aid has been very
 
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
helpful to many communities across the
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
state over the years Amy Clark has done
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
a great job of recapping that for the
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee I'm really here to just focus
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
on one thing and I think this is a a
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
concern of ours to
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
implementing School building Aid in the
 
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
future uh we really need to focus on
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
House Bill 214 and the 50 million do um
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
to put that into the statute we did have
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
a you know we had to do the moratorium
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
because of the tail and it exceeded the
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
$50 million as part of the budget
 
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
process we need a statute that sets in
 
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
place the $50 million so therefore the
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the legislature
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
can do the proper planning for the the
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
needs of the school
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
districts clearly Amy Clark has outlined
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of need I think uh that's
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by the uh survey it's also
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by the number of schools
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
that are currently applying without any
 
01:37:58.510 --> 01:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge of whether there's going to be
 
01:38:00.950 --> 01:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
the money or not and I think many more
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
schools would apply if there was a fixed
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
amount one of the concerns is is over
 
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
the last few years uh other issues have
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
clouded putting in place the $50 million
 
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
and I think this state has budgeted for
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
many many years the $50 million but it
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
was allocated to the
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
tail so what I'm trying to do here today
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
is I think that is the the key piece I
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
think years after that's locked in or
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
other legislation should then talk about
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
those other issues but my concern is is
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
if we don't get that in place uh we'll
 
01:38:43.229 --> 01:38:43.239 align:start position:0%
be having struggles every budget cycle
 
01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm just here to support
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
getting in place the $50 million I
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
support both bills because they both
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
have it in it but I think the issues get
 
01:38:56.709 --> 01:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
clouded under 594 because you end up
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
with winners and losers you end up with
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
a whole host of uh different discussions
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
and almost should be a separate but you
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
need to get the money locked in for the
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
Education with that I would end my
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
testimony and answer anybody's questions
 
01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:16.360 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr seen you in the hallways and
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
seen you on education prior to this so
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
welcome back are there any questions for
 
01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
Abbott Mr chair actually a question for
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
you and I really shouldn't be asking um
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
Mr Abbott the question saying as you and
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
I presented um the bills but I just want
 
01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
to point out that that there is a
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
difference in 214 and
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
594 with respect to
 
01:39:44.669 --> 01:39:44.679 align:start position:0%
the you I should either be talking
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot I'd like to add to
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
regarding Esser and some other comments
 
01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
but uh I'll have to do that after this
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
hearing is over I think you should do
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
the same thing okay no happy to happy to
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%

01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
history of the past construction

committees in our town of Hamstead for
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
the past dozen years or so our school
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
board has attempted to get the approval
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
of Warrant articles by the community in
 
01:43:28.030 --> 01:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
Hampstead these warrant articles were to
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
fix existing School problems in our
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
Central School that I feel should never
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
be problems as they cause an un
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
unhealthy learning environment for our
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
students this environment ultimately
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
proves dis disadvantageous to their
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
ability to compete with other school
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
districts in the state and throughout
 
01:43:43.679 --> 01:43:45.430 align:start position:0%
districts in the state and throughout
the

01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:47.390 --> 01:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
country as I stated before I was
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to travel overseas with
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
the Navy I was also during the this time
 
01:43:52.589 --> 01:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to take part in various
 
01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
sponsored relief and volunteer efforts
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
which included visiting schools in
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
countries such as Romania to paint
 
01:43:59.470 --> 01:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
hallways replace light and glass
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
pictures amongst other maintenance items
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
to you that to you and I seem pretty
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
routine however in those countries
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
having the resources to fix such small
 
01:44:11.310 --> 01:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
items was anything but small now in
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
hamon Central
 
01:44:15.589 --> 01:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
School I'm able to see firsthand issues
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
that remind me of those schools that I
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
visited while in the
 
01:44:22.109 --> 01:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
Navy those countries that were in the
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
Iron Curtain behind the Iron Curtain in
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
Eastern Europe pleas address the bill
 
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.790 --> 01:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
other I I thought I was representative
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
vad by providing I'm going into
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
providing what as an example a school
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
system is finding trouble to raise such
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
funds and is looking for from the state
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm about to provide just some
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
examples of a local school district that
 
01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
um is struggling to provide a proper
 
01:44:58.830 --> 01:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
environment for our students
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
representative Hill was allowed to talk
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
for 20
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
minutes I I just said go ahead please
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
representa okay thank you so here are
 
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
just a few of the building issues that
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
are facing Hamstead right now that we're
 
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
going to vote um that we're providing to
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer to vote on uh in March
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
these this is just a five these are five
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
items I could have easily given you
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
Dave's top 10 list but I'm going to go
 
01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
I'm limit to five to um be respectful of
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
the time representative lad thank
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
you first one we have exterior walls
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
with an R value of 1.2 in one area of
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
the building that provides education
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
space for eight classrooms to give you
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
an understanding of what an R value of
 
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
1.2 is equivalent to if you built a toy
 
01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
a tiny house made just of particle board
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
you would have greater insulation than
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
what these students have in this school
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
building this is not an
 
01:45:58.510 --> 01:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
exaggeration in the winter we have to
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
turn up the heat of an Antiquated HVAC
 
01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
system very high just to get the
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
temperature that is barely comfortable
 
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
it the noise from our HVAC is disruptive
 
01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
and then in later spring months when our
 
01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
kids return from summer break or are
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
about to go to summer break it is quite
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
unbearable and I'll give you the story
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
that one of those spring days I was able
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
to visit my daughter's classroom in this
 
01:46:22.830 --> 01:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
area of the school it was in June to
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
celebrate the end of the year of the
 
01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
classroom I was blessed to be able to
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
hear her and other students speak so
 
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
proudly of a year- end project when I
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
walked into the room it was unbearable
 
01:46:34.030 --> 01:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
they have a thermometer hanging in the
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
middle of the room it was 92 degrees
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
this is not an exaggeration I have
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
pictures of this this is not okay for
 
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
our students number two we have intake
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
vents in the same part of that building
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
that is sucking in exhaust from the cars
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
that are dropping off our kids and
 
01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:51.320 align:start position:0%
picking them up throughout the the day
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
these intakes are in the same part of
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
that building that I talked about with
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
the lack of insulation this section of
 
01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:57.639 align:start position:0%
the building serves eight classrooms as
 
01:46:59.589 --> 01:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
I said four for our kidney gardeners
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
four for our third graders this is
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
unhealthy and simply
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
unacceptable we ALS number three we have
 
01:47:08.350 --> 01:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
small and inadequate rooms classrooms
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
that the square foot are under the
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
recommended Space by the doe in numerous
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
studies about having adequate spacing in
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
some cases these rooms are 30% under the
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
recommended size in only about 25% of
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
our classrooms throughout the Central
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
School are actually larger than the
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
recommended size by the doe the only
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
reason we're allowed to have these Spa
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
spaces is because we are quote unquote
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in again this is
 
01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:37.719 align:start position:0%
unacceptable number four we have very
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
small spaces dedicated to the special
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
education population in our school and
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
it is growing as we had just heard from
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
um Amy Clark we pride ourselves in
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
providing the highest quality education
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
for these students we want to take take
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
care of them and keep them in District
 
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
we officially have only three small
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
spaces that our par Educators refer to
 
01:47:59.990 --> 01:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
as the closets the total space allocated
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
to the special Leed does make doe
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines when you combine them
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
together but they just barely make that
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
the entryway to our school is small but
 
01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's larger than those three closets and
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
I ask the representative sitting in the
 
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
large room right now to look around look
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
at the size of the room you're in right
 
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
now now divide that in five parts the
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
size of these three closets is the
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
equivalent to one of those parts that
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're sitting in just imagine being in
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
a professional trying to provide the
 
01:48:31.589 --> 01:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
best care for our special education
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
students in a space that's called the
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
closet that is the equivalent of that
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
desk that you're sitting at right now
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
number five and lastly Hamad student
 
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
population is on the rise we currently
 
01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
have a student population of 420
 
01:48:48.270 --> 01:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
students that's serving prek through
 
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
grade four next next year we're adding
 
01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
north of 500 or 80 kids to bring our
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
student population in this school to 500
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
in the forecast have us growing an
 
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
additional 60 to or more students over
 
01:49:04.990 --> 01:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
the coming years in this number is
 
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
conservative we are growing and we don't
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
space however what we've done to
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate and to be provide the space
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
that we need this year we've taken over
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
half of our library the library that our
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
students would traditionally go sit do
 
01:49:22.669 --> 01:49:22.679 align:start position:0%
projects get extra help work with a
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
librarian to read to get away from the
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
classroom to really just get into those
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
books they no longer can do that we
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't have the space for them to sit in
 
01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
the library they can go and find a book
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
and go back to their classroom maybe to
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
the hallway who knows where they'll go
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
but they will not be in our
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
library I'm afraid of what is next after
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
this year as we continue to grow because
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
we are utilizing 100% of our learning
 
01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
space I cannot commit to anyone with the
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
future boards Administration in Hamstead
 
01:49:52.350 --> 01:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
will have to do because we don't have
 
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
the adequate funding to provide the
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
adequate education however I feel that
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
without doing anything will'll be a
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
it'll continue to be inadequate and be a
 
01:50:03.629 --> 01:50:03.639 align:start position:0%
detriment to Future
 
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
students which brings us to why I'm here
 
01:50:08.589 --> 01:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
today again Hamad board has brought
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
forward articles to raise the money to
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
take care of the issues i' I've spoken
 
01:50:15.149 --> 01:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
to and many other issues I've not spoken
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
to we're doing everything possible to
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
inform and educate our wonderful and
 
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
supportive community of the
 
01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
needs we are out there every day on
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
social media knocking on doors making
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
phone calls having Zoom sessions with
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
our community to show the cost the value
 
01:50:30.669 --> 01:50:30.679 align:start position:0%
and other efforts to reduce the impact
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
of the cost to the taxpayers will bear
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
even though past warrants articles
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
attempted to fix these issues they have
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
failed our community is already seeing
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
this in their taxes and they're afraid
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
that by raising the taxes they're not
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
going to be able to live in these towns
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
we don't want to force our community
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
members out because the taxes get that
 
01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:53.390 align:start position:0%
members out because the taxes get that
high

01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very ahead can I just finish
 
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I am almost done I believe
 
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
that our town is not unlike any others
 
01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
that have been spoken to to
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
date I believe that we have hardworking
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
community members that are physically
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
conservative and are very cautious to
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
improve investment of millions of
 
01:51:12.069 --> 01:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
dollars that will impact their
 
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
taxes and for this reason I'm here to
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
ask and request that you consider
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
passing these
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
bills the states around New Hampshire
 
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
they support their towns with building
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
Aid you look North to us in Maine you
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
look south of us to Massachusetts in
 
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
other states throughout the country they
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
under the they understand the importance
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
of the aid they understand that to have
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
a 21st Century Learning environment that
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:40.109 --> 01:51:40.119 align:start position:0%
adequate we are asking that you consider
 
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
this bill and pass it on pass it so that
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
students of New Hampshire can be
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
competitive with other students in New
 
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
England with the proper funding that
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
this bill provides our students will be
 
01:51:49.950 --> 01:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
able to compete with students in our
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring states to receive the great
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
education that New Hampshire has been
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
known to provide and if we continue to
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
adequately support our students then
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
that will have a direct correlation to
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
educated Workforce businesses to
 
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be attracted to stay in New

Hampshire businesses that will start to
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
want to come to New
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses that will be
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
started in New Hampshire by investing in
 
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
the foundation of the education of
 
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.440 align:start position:0%

01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
speak this morning my name is Jim
 
01:53:14.669 --> 01:53:14.679 align:start position:0%
oconnell I'm a school board member at
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
large from the city of Manchester and um
 
01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
I I'll be very brief this morning I I
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
here to uh speak in support of both of
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
these bills um I I think that they are
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
the minimum step necessary um I won't
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
regail you with the many stories I could
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh about the needs in Manchester but
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
just briefly I would tell you that we
 
01:53:38.430 --> 01:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
have 22 schools some of those schools
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
are multi-building schools so 22 schools
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
represents a greater than just 22
 
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
buildings and some of our buildings date
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
from the 18 the late 19th century um we
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
have just concluded and we're still in
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
the process of finishing we've had a
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
draft report on our schools done by a
 
01:53:58.350 --> 01:53:58.360 align:start position:0%
national organization called MGT and
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's available on the Manchester
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
School District website with quite a lot
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
of detail on our school buildings but uh
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
let me just say that our average school
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
building in Manchester is 70 years old
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
and we have uh kids in autism programs
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
in glorified closets with no windows and
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
no air conditioning we've converted
 
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
locker rooms uh without Windows into
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
classrooms and I could go on and on and
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
on I think probably everybody in this
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
room or most people in your room are
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
aware that there is a great need for a
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
building Aid in the state of New
 
01:54:31.149 --> 01:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I was very pleased Mr
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
chairman to hear you begin your remarks
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
by pointing out the direct effect on
 
01:54:38.950 --> 01:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes for young people in
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
our state because of the buildings that
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
are that are
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
not capable of doing uh delivering a
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
proper education and of course as you
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out and what should be at at the
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
foremost of our minds is that this
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
inordinately affects the uh the least
 
01:54:58.589 --> 01:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
amongst us it is the poorest communities
 
01:55:00.189 --> 01:55:00.199 align:start position:0%
it is the children with the greatest of
 
01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
needs that uh and minority children that
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
are affected the greatest by these
 
01:55:06.669 --> 01:55:06.679 align:start position:0%
things so I encourage you I'm I'm I'm
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
pleased these bills are coming up I I I
 
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
um I think that the moratorium was uh we
 
01:55:13.470 --> 01:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
could talk about the merits of whether
 
01:55:15.149 --> 01:55:15.159 align:start position:0%
it was whether it was necessary or not
 
01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
but it should be behind us now and for
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
the future um we need major investment
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
in infrastructure in the school
 
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in the state of New
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I support both these bills
 
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I would encourage you to uh I would
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
encourage you to pass them I'd be happy

as you may know um I I'm WR I'm I wrote
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony and support of HB
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
594 um Mascoma School District over the
 
01:56:59.550 --> 01:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
summer of June of 2015 through September
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
2016 did a a large renovation
 
01:57:06.629 --> 01:57:06.639 align:start position:0%
21508 million renovation in addition to
 
01:57:08.950 --> 01:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
our high school um it took us three
 
01:57:11.709 --> 01:57:11.719 align:start position:0%
years to pass this through the voters if
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
it had passed during the first year it
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
was proposed we would be receiving
 
01:57:18.430 --> 01:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
building aid but because um the
 
01:57:20.550 --> 01:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
moratorium had gone into effect by the
 
01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
time we got this bill um the warrant
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
article passed um we have not received
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
any building Aid so I just wanted the
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
the committee to understand that um our
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
building was built in 63 it was very
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
deficient um we did convince the voters
 
01:57:41.270 --> 01:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
that it needed to be renovated and it's
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
a wonderful building now but it costs us
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
annually for these bonds $1.5 million
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
which amounts to over 5% of our total
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
$29 million annual
 
01:57:56.709 --> 01:57:56.719 align:start position:0%
budget so I I'm just asking the
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
committee to um consider our situ
 
01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
situation um as you debate the merits of
 
01:58:05.870 --> 01:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
HB 594 and what it would mean to the
 
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the masoma Valley Regional
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%

who have a copy of the bill and part I'm
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
GNA walk through it and and explain as
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
we move down from page to page or Line
 
02:02:12.189 --> 02:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
to Line uh this is a bill that deals
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
with the content of adequacy and it also
 
02:02:19.229 --> 02:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
deals with the costing of adequacy so on
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
page one if you're looking at lines 10
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
where there's you'll see some changes um
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
and of course there's a change at the
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
top on line three where we see the
 
02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
02:02:36.069 --> 02:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
but going down to line 10 there is a
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
what I call a significant change in
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
regard to criteria for an adequate
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
education adequate education shall
 
02:02:44.470 --> 02:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
provide all students for the opportunity
 
02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
to acquire and apply now we've learned
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
that through all our CP programming and
 
02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
through what's going on in education
 
02:02:57.310 --> 02:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
today it's just not the knowledge and
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
the skill you learn it's the ability to
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
apply that Knowledge and Skills and know
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
how to communicate your skills and and
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
and and make that knowledge uh work for
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
you or or for your your employer going
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
down to line 14 knowledge and skill we
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
added the word knowledge and to parallel
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
what we have elsewhere in definition we
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
use Knowledge and
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
Skills line
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
16 deals with knowledge of biological
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
physical and Earth Sciences to enable
 
02:03:32.189 --> 02:03:32.199 align:start position:0%
them to understand and appreciate the
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
world and be around them as the way it
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
used to be but we added in and
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
engineering social economic and
 
02:03:43.510 --> 02:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
geopolitical challenges uh this past
 
02:03:46.549 --> 02:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
summer when I was working with uh Dr
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
Jeff who's the technical director of the
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
gold region science and engineering lab
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
in Hanover New Hampshire uh working with
 
02:03:57.870 --> 02:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
the core of engineers uh this is a a
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
well guarded facility in Hanover with
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
wire and you can't get in place it's
 
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
huge size of the LV and the capital
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
building combined and they're dealing
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
with issues dealing with h climate and
 
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with the Sciences which deal
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
with those challenges that I speak to
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
that adding in there um in regard to our
 
02:04:23.549 --> 02:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
world the the challenge of understanding
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
engineering I think that's fairly
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
obvious the social economic and the
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
geopolitical challenges around us are
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
huge right now if you were to look at
 
02:04:35.790 --> 02:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
the Artic where I lived for 25 years
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
very close to the Artic and Northern
 
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
Alaska there are changes going on in our
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
world back in 1980 the ice cap had
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 7.8 8 million
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
kilometers now it has 3.6 million
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
kilometers that's has tremendous
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
geopolitical issues and challenges for
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
us in terms of that's becoming a prime
 
02:05:03.149 --> 02:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
sea Lane growing through there it's
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
being claimed by many countries aside
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
from Canada and the United States we
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
might add in China and Russia so there's
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
keal challenges going on that our our
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
our young people coming out of school
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
should be prepared to uh address these
 
02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
going down to line
 
02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
26 skills for lifelong learning
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
including interpersonal techn
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
technological skills to enable them to
 
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.510 align:start position:0%
technological skills to enable them to
work

02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
communicate we've had the directors at
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
the cor technical education uh uh
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
facility saying one of the most
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
important things we can have kids learn
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
is how to communicate communicate in an
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
effective manner so that word has been
 
02:05:48.669 --> 02:05:48.679 align:start position:0%
added in under line 29 what is a sub
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
substantive educational content of an
 
02:05:53.229 --> 02:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
adequate education I don't think I have
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
to remind the legislature and members
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
here attending today that it is the
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
legislator's responsibility to define
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
the delivery of an adequate education as
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
well as what is an adequate
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
education so this phraseology that's
 
02:06:11.750 --> 02:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
been inserted now taking out reference
 
02:06:14.669 --> 02:06:14.679 align:start position:0%
back in 20189 we have to do that just
 
02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
more of a technical change an adequate
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
education is one which still students
 
02:06:22.549 --> 02:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
with Essential Knowledge derived from
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
rigorous academic study applied learning
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
again the word apply therefore
 
02:06:30.109 --> 02:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
shall be shall be defined as rigorous
 
02:06:35.870 --> 02:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
academic study and applied learning in
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
the following four knowledge domains
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
those domains are listed down below one
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
of things that has been done and working
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
down through on line seven you see it
 
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
used to be just pling science now we're
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
opening that up to biology physical
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
science and Earth
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
Science Under social studies it used to
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
be social studies we've heard from many
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
geography teachers throughout this state
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
that geography is kind of a missing
 
02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
subject now in a lot of our social
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
studies classes so going back and
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
opening up Civics and government
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
economics geography and history if you
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
look at 306 rule 306 you'll find these
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
subjects are required to be taught in
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
our school
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
RS jumping down we've had a lot of
 
02:07:24.549 --> 02:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
discussion line 15 before in the past
 
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the need for personal finances
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
to be taught to our young people
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
obviously how to balance a checkbook is
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
important so that is also inserted as
 
02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
one of the core knowledge
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
domains what we changed is the area
 
02:07:43.709 --> 02:07:43.719 align:start position:0%
where we used to have computer science
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
and digital literacy as a separate
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
domain teachers shall use academic and
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
applied instruction to teach the core
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
domains under paragraph one the
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
following skills shall be integrated
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
into the core domains the concept here
 
02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
is that computer science and digital
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
literacy is a part of mathematics it's a
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
part of History it's a part of every
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
domain that we have we're using uh
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
computer technology today in
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
communicating uh I'm certainly not doing
 
02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
mathematics now but I am practicing a
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
language art
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
skill looking at logic and rhetoric
 
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
logic and rhetoric are simply thinking
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
skills which we all believe that that's
 
02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
one of the Prime things we have to try
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
to instill on kids is how to think and
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
how to use that ability to learn and
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
rhetoric is the ability to communicate
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
both speaking and written lines those
 
02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
are skills that also belong immersed
 
02:08:44.669 --> 02:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
into all the subjects above or those
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
domains going down to line 22 on page
 
02:08:51.629 --> 02:08:51.639 align:start position:0%
two on receiving a valid completion
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
certificate from a state board approved
 
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
alternative program on high school Under
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
rsc4 call 23 shall Grant equivalent High
 
02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:02.559 align:start position:0%
School Credit leading to graduation to a
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
student has completed such alternative
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
program and you'll see down in line 29
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we have program also included in on
 
02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
what is an academic standard means what
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
a student should know be able to do in a
 
02:09:20.030 --> 02:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
course which we have high school middle
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
school or at a level which we've had
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
because we in the elementary schools K
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
through 8 k28 is considered Elementary
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
as well as Middle School at the top end
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
we teach by grade level and subjects are
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
Tau thematically throughout the but we
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
have programs as well we have programs
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
for example clear technical education
 
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:44.559 align:start position:0%
those are programs and reading to
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
certification and but they are academic
 
02:09:49.069 --> 02:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
standards that can lead towards
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
graduation you through the CTE centers
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
you can get concurrent and dual
 
02:09:57.310 --> 02:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
enrollment as well and credit underneath
 
02:09:59.310 --> 02:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
the cost of an adequate education on
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
line 31 or going down line
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
34 it the general court shall determine
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
the necessary specific resource elements
 
02:10:12.109 --> 02:10:12.119 align:start position:0%
to be included in costing and adequate
 
02:10:14.430 --> 02:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
education it is the
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the legislature to
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
Define an adequate education therefore
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
it's also to achieve that we must also
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh determine necessary specific resource
 
02:10:31.069 --> 02:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
elements necessary to the uh to uh
 
02:10:33.510 --> 02:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
equate to the costing of that
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
education within our Co costing formula
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
funding formula we have base cost and
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's line 36 the base cost represents
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
the essential peral resources apply to
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
general education students the
 
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
substantive educational content for the
 
02:10:52.270 --> 02:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
education in addition to finding the
 
02:10:56.830 --> 02:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
base cost funding the base cost the
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
general C finds and what we have is for
 
02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
those students that have needs that
 
02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
extend beyond these costs we have
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid this is what we are
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
doing right now in current legislation
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
and I've been doing such as a result of
 
02:11:13.069 --> 02:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that came out of the
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
joint legislative uh uh committee
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
looking at education funding and the
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
accountability for funding in
 
02:11:26.109 --> 02:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
2008 which was a very B was a bipartisan
 
02:11:29.149 --> 02:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
um Committee of which the the party I'm
 
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
in was part of the minority at that time
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
in 2018 this was also endorsed by a task
 
02:11:38.430 --> 02:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
force that studied education funding by
 
02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
a task force that had a chair which was
 
02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
of this part that I'm a member of and
 
02:11:45.310 --> 02:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
the opposite party was in the minority
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
but it seems that both of those groups
 
02:11:50.229 --> 02:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
have agreed that we need to have a
 
02:11:52.549 --> 02:11:52.559 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid which matches line
 
02:11:56.189 --> 02:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
six seven and eight the education needs
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
of special education students which
 
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
extend beyond the uh Bas in order to
 
02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.189 align:start position:0%
extend beyond the uh Bas in order to
achieve

02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
adequacy for English language Learners
 
02:12:08.589 --> 02:12:08.599 align:start position:0%
and for economically disadvantaged
 
02:12:12.109 --> 02:12:12.119 align:start position:0%
students free of theuse I do not have
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
free uh excuse me the third grade
 
02:12:18.069 --> 02:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
leading component in here um that we've
 
02:12:19.629 --> 02:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
discuss that even on the funding
 
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
commission and it's an element which yes
 
02:12:24.669 --> 02:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
it can be achieved and should be
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
achieved however um there are other
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue for that including
 
02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
title one and it amounted to
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
approximately uh not a huge amount of
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
money so I I've taken that out that came
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
in um several years
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
back I'm not objecting to it be included
 
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
either but it it's not there in this
 
02:12:47.709 --> 02:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
particular bill in this section base
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
cost means the per pupal resources
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
necessary to provide a student with the
 
02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to acquire an adequate
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
education as defined by the RSA in
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
situations where no additional
 
02:13:01.350 --> 02:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid is necessary to do it
 
02:13:04.030 --> 02:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
to address the increased cost of
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
providing meta opportuni students who
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
have additional educational needs so the
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
the base cost is comprised of and you'll
 
02:13:15.069 --> 02:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
see that in line 16 through 20 this
 
02:13:18.549 --> 02:13:18.559 align:start position:0%
comes and been extrapolated right out of
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.189 --> 02:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation all of us may have
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
concerns about how much is provided in
 
02:13:32.109 --> 02:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
regard to each of these elements this
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
just identifies the elements the
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
legislature still has the responsibility
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
in working with the Department saying is
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
the pupil teacher ratio going to be 25
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
to1 K through2 is it going to be 330 to
 
02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
one for grades three on upwards or is it
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
going to be changed that this bill
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't address that it just identifies
 
02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
the the elements which are required to
 
02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
be funded under base adus base cost and
 
02:14:03.629 --> 02:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
statute PRI this has never had the ratio
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
for example 25 to1 30 to1 in statute
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
that is done by administrative rule done
 
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
by the Department of
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
Education on line 23 through 25 there
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
school shall demonstrated provise the
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education and that's
 
02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's same mind which we've had before
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
and it it replicates those key domains
 
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
that are evidenced earlier in the bill
 
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
and lastly on page
 
02:14:33.950 --> 02:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
four there is a section for
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
accountability that's been added in
 
02:14:39.310 --> 02:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
beyond what we have currently in law the
 
02:14:40.669 --> 02:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall provide the
 
02:14:42.549 --> 02:14:42.559 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
identified in RSA 193c col 2 we do have
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
a legislative oversight committee that
 
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
looks at this aspect of Education with
 
02:14:53.549 --> 02:14:53.559 align:start position:0%
an annual status report by November one
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
the report shall include any school that
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
is unable to demonstrate that it
 
02:14:59.310 --> 02:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity for adequate
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
education through the input based School
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
accountability system we have two
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
systems we have performance outcomes and
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have this might support both
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
methodologies we need both outcome is
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
extremely important however I do not
 
02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
believe outcome should be defined as a
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
certain cost number to meet the average
 
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:22.559 align:start position:0%
cost of a student based on our doe 25
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
forms that does not thoroughly Define
 
02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
what those elements those key elements
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
those key domains are in education going
 
02:15:33.069 --> 02:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
on in line 10 the department shall
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
Implement corrective and technical
 
02:15:37.709 --> 02:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
assistance in accordance with RSA 193
 
02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
e3e so there is a process where
 
02:15:43.229 --> 02:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
technicals support can be off notice of
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
this status shall be posted on the
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
school and the school district website
 
02:15:50.189 --> 02:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
the school or School District shall
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
provide written notice of such status to
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
parents or guardians of students
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the affected school so this
 
02:16:00.589 --> 02:16:00.599 align:start position:0%
is the best way to be transparent and
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
open is to let parents know exactly what
 
02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
we have in a school whether that the
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
inputs are being accomplished or not uh
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
it will be reflected on that
 
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
accountability system I believe that
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation clearly defines what we
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
have and what we asked for in terms of
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
defining adequate education and content
 
02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
love and also clearly defines how we're
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
going to cost out an adequate
 
02:16:31.150 --> 02:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
education thank you very
 
02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
much uh thank you chairman wait a minute
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
I may have forgotten one other component
 
02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:36.870 align:start position:0%
I may have forgotten one other component
in

02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
this beyond the differentiated a and
 
02:16:45.389 --> 02:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy base that we call adequacy
 
02:16:48.349 --> 02:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
there are two areas which fiscal
 
02:16:52.110 --> 02:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity a is part of this and
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
those areas include the equalized
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
valuation prop property value per pupil
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
and secondly there is another one which
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
is coming forward in another bill 68
 
02:17:05.070 --> 02:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
which defines that there's another area
 
02:17:08.509 --> 02:17:08.519 align:start position:0%
of of disparity Aid provided for those
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
schools regardless of their will and
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's been always a concern to
 
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
myself that we have pockets of the
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
children with in schools that have high
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per people over the
 
02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
average of 1.14 million per student
 
02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
that's the average equalized evaluation
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
these Pockets these schools have a
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
sizable number of level one and level
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
two students remember level three and
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
four are either your proficient or above
 
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
proficiency highly proficient on the
 
02:17:42.669 --> 02:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
Statewide education performance uh
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
assessment so those schools would level
 
02:17:47.070 --> 02:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
one and two qualifying students they
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
would receive funding also so the
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
funding formula is being proposed later
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
but within this area of finding the
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
adequate education an adequate education
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
is simply that of the Bas and the
 
02:18:03.629 --> 02:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
differentiated a thank you very much
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I do see some members have
 
02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions start with
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
representer uh thank you um Mr chairman
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'd like to draw
 
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
the to line to page three starting on
 
02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:25.309 align:start position:0%
the to line to page three starting on
line

02:18:25.309 --> 02:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:18:29.309 --> 02:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
12 uh this uh deals with the definition
 
02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
of the input uh to the costing of an
 
02:18:35.549 --> 02:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
adequate education it's unfortunate that
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
the committee is uh reviewing this bill
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
at this time I requested of the chairman
 
02:18:45.870 --> 02:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
lad to have a briefing of the committee
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the results of the Commission on
 
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
school funding it would have allowed the
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
committee to understand the commission's
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
report which was um unanimously with the
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
exception of Representative lad's uh
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
opposition to the commission's report
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
the commission's report would give you a
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
different approach to the funding of
 
02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
schools this input approach to funding
 
02:19:16.589 --> 02:19:16.599 align:start position:0%
of schools is basically a continuation
 
02:19:18.990 --> 02:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
of the current way with which we fund
 
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
schools the commission is recommending a
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
different way of funding schools and
 
02:19:27.389 --> 02:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
that will that is uh being presented by
 
02:19:31.270 --> 02:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan in the Senate and I think
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate for the committee to
 
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
hear only this particular approach
 
02:19:39.790 --> 02:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
without having an opportunity to hear
 
02:19:42.429 --> 02:19:42.439 align:start position:0%
what the commission spent the summer in
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
reviewing the data from schools for the
 
02:19:47.549 --> 02:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
past 10 years and making a recommend
 
02:19:49.710 --> 02:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
ation that's contrary to this particular
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
provision of this bill I again would
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
request that the that chairman lad allow
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
the committee to hear the report and the
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the findings of the
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
commission before we exact this
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
particular Bill thank you very much at
 
02:20:09.309 --> 02:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
this point in time repr Miler uh I'm

responding to you even though there was
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
no question and it was not relative to
 
02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
this bill HB 242 and as of this I will
 
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
be taking no more
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
interesting I got a question wow I got a
 
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
question really the prime sponsor is
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
said he was not taking questions the
 
02:20:36.870 --> 02:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of a bill that goes 180
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
degrees opposite from what the
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission to study school funding found
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
and you won't take a question that's
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
unbelievable something that a bill that
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
ments I mean Jim oconnell from
 
02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester was just here talking about
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
how Manchester school buildings are
 
02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
stuck a lot of them are stuck in the
 
02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:58.359 align:start position:0%
1800s what you're proposing here is also
 
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
stuck in the
 
02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:04.030 align:start position:0%
stuck in the
1800s

02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:07.349 --> 02:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
unbelievable additional two uh people
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%

that's

02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%

Barrett Christina executive director of
 
02:21:38.469 --> 02:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
Association um we um we are opposed to
 
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:21:47.309 --> 02:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
242 um we think that there's some uh
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
some Merit to some of the language in
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
the bill um it certainly um in some
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
aspects um does reflect what we think is
 
02:21:58.429 --> 02:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
is a good update to to to the adequacy
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
statute um I'm going to point to a
 
02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
couple concerns that nhba um has with
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
the bill though uh I'm on page two um
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
starting on line 22 it's sub paragraph B
 
02:22:12.510 --> 02:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
it begins upon receiving a valid
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
completion from a state board approved
 
02:22:18.110 --> 02:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
Alternative Program uh the the high
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
school uh shall Grant equivalent High
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
School Credit leading to graduation this
 
02:22:25.870 --> 02:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
is the learn learn everywhere language
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
that we saw a couple years ago um that
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're just moving that around and and
 
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
making it clear to um uh to follow the
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education regulations
 
02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
about learn everywhere that if a kid
 
02:22:39.750 --> 02:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
goes off and takes a an alternative
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
program um that and from an approved
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program the high school
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
has to give them credit um alternative
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
program should be defined there are
 
02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
multiple places in Statute in which an
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
alternative program is referenced there
 
02:22:56.469 --> 02:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
are Provisions in the Department of
 
02:22:59.750 --> 02:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
Education rule 306 there are alternative
 
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
programs under RSA 193 colen one which
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
is the mandatory attendance statute and
 
02:23:08.990 --> 02:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch put that in back in like
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
2008 basically for atrisk kids who are
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
at risk for dropping out you school has
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
to develop an alternative plan for them
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
to hopefully graduate from high school
 
02:23:19.630 --> 02:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
so by just saying alternative plan we've
 
02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
got three or four different places in
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
law where there's references an
 
02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
alternative plan doesn't indicate which
 
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
one um the other problem with putting
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
that language about these alternative
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
programs if it does relate to sort of a
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program under the doe
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
the 1400 rules um you're you're putting
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the adequate education statute
 
02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's a simple argument for a parent
 
02:23:44.429 --> 02:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
to make that the state then has to pay
 
02:23:47.910 --> 02:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
for that Alternative Program um and the
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
state has to pay for adequacy we know
 
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
that um so if if this alternative
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
program is not being offered by the
 
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
local school district and it's from some
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
outside vendor um uh Girl Scouts uh
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
Signum University I believe was just um
 
02:24:04.990 --> 02:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
approved as a learn everywhere program
 
02:24:06.269 --> 02:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
my argument is that the state's going to
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it then because it's
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
part of an adequate education um that's
 
02:24:12.190 --> 02:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
one that's one challenge that we have
 
02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
with the um with the bill uh moving on
 
02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
to page three I'm on line 12 the subar
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph about um 1A where it talks
 
02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
about base cost um and we have listed
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
out teacher specialty teachers um and
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
glad to see facilities operations and
 
02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
transportation included in there because
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
those really are not currently funded as
 
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
part of the the adequacy formula um but
 
02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
we think that there should be other
 
02:24:40.510 --> 02:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
things included um within there I I see
 
02:24:43.230 --> 02:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
online 16 it does relate to it speaks to
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
Specialty teachers I don't know if
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's intended to cover special educ
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
ucation um but to the extent that
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
special education is going to be
 
02:24:52.990 --> 02:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
included in this I think that should be
 
02:24:53.950 --> 02:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
clarified um also to the and and I
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
understand that the rules and the
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
statutes don't always match up and they
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
should um but we've heard a lot of of
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
testimony um and a lot of bills the last
 
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
couple years about Workforce Development
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
um Alternative Learning programs
 
02:25:14.710 --> 02:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
Extended Learning opportunities um it
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
would make sense that extended learning
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity coordinators would be
 
02:25:20.830 --> 02:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
covered for our high schools as part of
 
02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
an adequate education if that's what we
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
want to move to I don't I don't see that
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
in here um so if if that's a prerogative
 
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
um uh of of of this committee and
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
certainly Statewide we should include um
 
02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
Extended Learning opportunity
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
coordinators as part of the the the the
 
02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:39.790 align:start position:0%
coordinators as part of the the the the
adequate

02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
education um I'm on page four now uh
 
02:25:46.269 --> 02:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
line the the last paragraph subar
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph and sort of that new bold
 
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
language um I I I I get that there needs
 
02:25:53.550 --> 02:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
to be oversight from from the Department
 
02:25:55.150 --> 02:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
of Education there needs to be oversight
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the legislatures and the status of
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
our schools but I I read this about um
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
um uh corrective action technical
 
02:26:07.389 --> 02:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
assistance noticing it on the on the
 
02:26:09.950 --> 02:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
district's website um when I first read
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
this I I my first thought was that we
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
had reverted back to No Child Left
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
Behind back in 2001 and 2002 um when we
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
had to provide all these notices of a
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
school was not making it or you know
 
02:26:25.349 --> 02:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
based on whatever criteria um had been
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
established at the by the federal
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
government at that time it just we we've
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
sort of moved away from that
 
02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I I don't know why that's
 
02:26:38.030 --> 02:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
necessar necessary um and the last
 
02:26:41.870 --> 02:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
objection nhba has to the bill um and I
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
I I may be off on this I I don't always
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
understand sort of the legislative
 
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
processes and what bills get a fiscal
 
02:26:49.630 --> 02:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
note and what bills don't but if we're
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
talking about you know what an adequate
 
02:26:54.590 --> 02:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
education the base cost of an adequate
 
02:26:56.349 --> 02:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
education and we're making significant
 
02:26:59.230 --> 02:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
changes to to not just the curricular
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
aspects of what a school dist has to
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
cover but um again that that language on
 
02:27:07.389 --> 02:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
page three line 12 about base cost means
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
and then it list of teachers and
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
Specialists guidance counselers it seems
 
02:27:12.750 --> 02:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
that there should be a fiscal note
 
02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
attached to this too um as to what what
 
02:27:16.830 --> 02:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
though what all those things are going
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
the cost and I know that we've got
 
02:27:19.990 --> 02:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
issues with the the study commission and
 
02:27:21.429 --> 02:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
bills relative to that and bills
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
relative to funding but um I think there
 
02:27:25.710 --> 02:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
should be a fiscal note included with
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
with the bill as well too or at least
 
02:27:29.309 --> 02:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
some analysis as to what all those
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
changes are are going to ultimately cost
 
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
so um that's NH hba's testimony I'm
 
02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
02:27:41.950 --> 02:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:45.950 --> 02:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
you none thank you very much thank you
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
we'll move on
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
last uh good morning uh thank you very
 
02:28:16.429 --> 02:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
much uh chairman cordelli um and members
 
02:28:21.269 --> 02:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
of House Ed um my name is Carl lad I'm
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh the executive director of the New
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school administrators
 
02:28:26.910 --> 02:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
Association uh nhsaa has not taken a
 
02:28:29.429 --> 02:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
formal position on this bill we are
 
02:28:32.830 --> 02:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
neutral um we do have a number of
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
questions um one of the reasons why
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
we're neutral on this bill is because we
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
recognize uh representative lad's
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
passion about um uh the content of an
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
adequate education uh he has been um
 
02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
he's been a a strong voice in this area
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
for um for many years uh and we
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of what he's
 
02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do we do have some uh
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
significant questions uh and concerns
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
about the bill uh some of which um uh Mr
 
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
Christina brought up so I will not um
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'll not reiterate those ough we do
 
02:29:14.670 --> 02:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
share the same concerns uh I do have um
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
a few questions about uh some of the
 
02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
language of the bill um and what the
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
implications are uh at the top of page
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
two on line one uh where it says
 
02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:29.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge derived from rigorous academic
 
02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:31.610 align:start position:0%
study and applied
 
02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:32.910 align:start position:0%
study and applied
[Music]

02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:29:35.389 --> 02:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
learning un unless we're going to use
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
the definition of I know it when I see
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
it um we need to have a a clear
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
definition of what is going to
 
02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
constitute rigorous academic study
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
because that may mean very different
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
things uh for Handover High School uh as
 
02:29:53.950 --> 02:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to another school in the
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
state I'm also a little concerned about
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
the definition of logic and
 
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
rhetoric um I I think that that needs to
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
be much more clearly defined uh because
 
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about critical thinking
 
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
skills uh those are already in uh the
 
02:30:09.120 --> 02:30:10.230 align:start position:0%
skills uh those are already in uh the
minimum

02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:12.670 align:start position:0%
minimum
standards

02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
um on line 22 Begins the section about
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
the valid uh completion certificate uh
 
02:30:23.550 --> 02:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
if these alternative programs are going
 
02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
to be uh awarded the same type of credit
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
as the core academic standards up above
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
um do these alternative programs uh do
 
02:30:38.590 --> 02:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
they have to meet the core requirements
 
02:30:42.030 --> 02:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh that are listed above um or is it
 
02:30:47.309 --> 02:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
just uh any state board approved program
 
02:30:50.030 --> 02:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
and then as I was reading through this I
 
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
was really um confused about why we're
 
02:30:55.349 --> 02:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
not talking about
 
02:30:58.110 --> 02:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
competencies um because the the state
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
has identified competencies competencies
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
are in the minimum standards uh for
 
02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
school approval uh all of the
 
02:31:08.630 --> 02:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
instruction and assessment uh that go on
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
in public schools now are based on
 
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
competencies uh so I think that there's
 
02:31:15.870 --> 02:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion around here um
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
clarification again um on line 36 when
 
02:31:26.429 --> 02:31:26.439 align:start position:0%
we start talking about the cost of
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
inadequate education it says the base
 
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
cost represents the essential per pupil
 
02:31:34.990 --> 02:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
resources again I would just ask for uh
 
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.190 align:start position:0%
resources again I would just ask for uh
some

02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on line uh excuse me on
 
02:31:44.269 --> 02:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
page three uh when uh on beginning on
 
02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
line nine when we're talking about the
 
02:31:50.190 --> 02:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
cost of fiscal capacity disparity Aid um
 
02:31:51.870 --> 02:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
provided to
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities um with the lowest
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuations per pupil
 
02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm unsure whether that means the
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
lowest quartile the lowest third the
 
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
lowest half of the state um so I think
 
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
that would probably need to be further
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
defined um and then I do believe that uh
 
02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
the next section is a step forward uh in
 
02:32:18.630 --> 02:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
that um we have never had uh all of
 
02:32:22.349 --> 02:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
these categories included uh in the cost
 
02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education including uh
 
02:32:29.269 --> 02:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
facilities operation maintenance and
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
transportation and I did for for some
 
02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
reason I did sign up to speak to the to
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
the last Bills on building aid but
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
understand with everything going on that
 
02:32:42.429 --> 02:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
that that probably some balls got
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
juggled and dropped which is fine could
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
be on my end um um but I do think that
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
the facil operation and maintenance is
 
02:32:51.389 --> 02:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
incredibly important in the cost of a
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
base adequate
 
02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
education and then uh uh finally I'd
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
like to um just talk a little bit about
 
02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
um starting online 10 uh where it says
 
02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
the department shall Implement
 
02:33:07.429 --> 02:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
corrective and technical
 
02:33:11.070 --> 02:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
assistance um I I just question the
 
02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
Department's capacity to provide any
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
kind of technical assistance uh they're
 
02:33:18.750 --> 02:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
unable to provide the assistance that's
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
currently required by Statute regarding
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
School approval um visitations and this
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
was prior to co um and to provide
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
technical assistance on curricular areas
 
02:33:34.990 --> 02:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
and scho and schools who are uh
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
determined to be uh in need of
 
02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
improvement so as we look at this bill
 
02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
and we look at a number of other bills
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh that says the department will provide
 
02:33:46.510 --> 02:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
oversight I think we have to really
 
02:33:48.309 --> 02:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
think about the totality of what we're
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
asking the department to do um because
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
they simply do not have the capacity uh
 
02:33:57.309 --> 02:33:57.319 align:start position:0%
to to provide the kind of oversight that
 
02:34:00.230 --> 02:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
is imagined in this bill and then
 
02:34:02.590 --> 02:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
finally on line 14 it says the effective
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
date shall take effect 60 days after the
 
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
passage now if this bill were to be
 
02:34:12.269 --> 02:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
enacted uh in this legislative session
 
02:34:15.750 --> 02:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
and it were to uh be signed into law uh
 
02:34:18.269 --> 02:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
that would most likely not happen until
 
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
June all of the high school schedules
 
02:34:24.190 --> 02:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
are long since written students are
 
02:34:27.030 --> 02:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
assigned to classes in May budgets have
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
been approved in March uh so there would
 
02:34:33.870 --> 02:34:33.880 align:start position:0%
be no opportunity to be able to meet the
 
02:34:36.750 --> 02:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
requirements of this legislation if it
 
02:34:39.710 --> 02:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
was uh to be enacted that
 
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
quickly as a recommendation um and
 
02:34:44.750 --> 02:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
certainly if the State Board of
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
Education is going to go into rul making
 
02:34:49.710 --> 02:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
around this uh it would it needs to be a
 
02:34:51.790 --> 02:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
much longer effective date something
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
like two years from now uh in order to
 
02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
be able to make this effective and um uh
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
and purposeful for school districts
 
02:35:07.389 --> 02:35:07.399 align:start position:0%
again um you know we're always happy to
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
to support and help where we can um we
 
02:35:13.630 --> 02:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
are not taking a position on this bill
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
but it does raise serious questions um
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to representative
 
02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
Vlad I don't think it's ready for prime
 
02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
time just
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
yet and with that I'll end my testimony
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and I'm sorry if we
 
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%

not on
 
02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
our list so um apologize
 
02:35:38.670 --> 02:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
oversight um we do have some
 
02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:40.389 align:start position:0%
oversight um we do have some
questions

02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
represent yes I thank you for taking my
 
02:35:45.150 --> 02:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
question I was Wonder through you
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
mention is
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
um on the last page of the
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill line 10 the department Implement
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
cor and technical assistance in
 
02:35:59.230 --> 02:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
accordance with RS
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
193 and then you mentioned that the
 
02:36:04.990 --> 02:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
department is not following through not
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
able to keep up with the current
 
02:36:09.389 --> 02:36:09.399 align:start position:0%
technical assistance demands I was
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could give me an
 
02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
example of uh What uh what we might be
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
able to look at as far as that goes
 
02:36:19.990 --> 02:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Hobson thank
 
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
you for the question um one of the one
 
02:36:24.910 --> 02:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
of the areas of technical assistance
 
02:36:27.510 --> 02:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
that um districts have not had for many
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
years now uh has been in the curricular
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
areas uh there used to be a Content area
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
specialist for language arts
 
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
mathematics um uh Humanities uh and
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
science uh those positions no longer
 
02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
exist um and as more uh competency uh
 
02:36:52.990 --> 02:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
driven work uh has been asked of school
 
02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
districts there's been little to no
 
02:36:56.950 --> 02:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
technical assistance available from the
 
02:36:59.630 --> 02:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
Department that's not through they're
 
02:37:02.429 --> 02:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
not wanting to provide the resources
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
they just have been unable to um several
 
02:37:09.710 --> 02:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
years ago the department went through
 
02:37:13.389 --> 02:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
a um a kind of a reorganization if you
 
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
will um and I and certainly understand
 
02:37:17.950 --> 02:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
the need to
 
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
reorganize uh bureaucracies uh when
 
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
necessary uh but there was a school
 
02:37:26.190 --> 02:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
approval process where um
 
02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
representatives of the department would
 
02:37:30.389 --> 02:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
go out into the field and actually visit
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
the schools um and look at both their
 
02:37:36.429 --> 02:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
curricular and building needs uh as they
 
02:37:38.790 --> 02:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
were going around to ensure that
 
02:37:41.469 --> 02:37:41.479 align:start position:0%
students were um or that school
 
02:37:43.710 --> 02:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
districts were providing the correct
 
02:37:47.070 --> 02:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
inputs now it is really just based on a
 
02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
survey uh that is sent out uh because
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's only one person in the
 
02:37:54.630 --> 02:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
department uh who does yman work uh but
 
02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
it's impossible for her uh to get out
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
into the field uh to visit every public
 
02:38:02.910 --> 02:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
school that's up for school approval uh
 
02:38:05.389 --> 02:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
within their cycle it's just it's not
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
possible uh not physically possible not
 
02:38:09.870 --> 02:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
because she doesn't want to it's because
 
02:38:12.269 --> 02:38:12.279 align:start position:0%
she can't be there we'd have to hire her
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
a helicopter uh in order to do that so I
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
just think that as we look at this and
 
02:38:20.269 --> 02:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
as we look at Innovation schools and as
 
02:38:22.830 --> 02:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
we look at scholarship programs and we
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
look at all these things that we're
 
02:38:28.349 --> 02:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
anticipating the department to provide
 
02:38:31.870 --> 02:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
oversight and technical assistance on I
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
just want us to be cautious that it's
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
really not realistic and it's not
 
02:38:37.630 --> 02:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to they just
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources so unless
 
02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're willing to pour a lot of
 
02:38:43.870 --> 02:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
resources into the department I I just
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
worry about the ability of the these
 
02:38:49.150 --> 02:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
things to be met in the manner in which
 
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
you wish that they would be I hope that
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
answers your question it does thank you
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
very much thank you any further
 
02:39:00.190 --> 02:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:02.910 --> 02:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
committee me me
 
02:39:07.349 --> 02:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
yes M thank you uh Mr chair and thank
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr lad for taking my question um
 
02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
so with regards to looking at this uh
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
this sort of formula for funding here um
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
do do you feel that it addresses the uh
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
differences between let's say someplace
 
02:39:31.389 --> 02:39:31.399 align:start position:0%
like Manchester which uh we know
 
02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
is experiencing
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
tremendous upheaval in trying to meet
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
the demands and the needs of their
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
diverse student body um and and some of
 
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
the Suburban towns I mean what what what
 
02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
does this do for the inequities between
 
02:39:52.429 --> 02:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
the Suburban towns and and the
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
city uh that's a great question
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Mullen and uh again with
 
02:39:59.750 --> 02:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note attached to this it's
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
very difficult to actually see what the
 
02:40:05.790 --> 02:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
implications of the bill are um I do
 
02:40:08.550 --> 02:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
think that um there because of the way
 
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
that um there is some fiscal disparity
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
Aid written into the bill um that that
 
02:40:18.670 --> 02:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
may that may be um a supplemental
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
support um but again without seeing a
 
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it's hard to
 
02:40:27.469 --> 02:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
determine so just a followup M Mr chair
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
so so what you're saying to me then Mr
 
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
lad is that looking at this you wouldn't
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
be able to make predictions on uh how
 
02:40:39.389 --> 02:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
much academic Improvement Manchester was
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to be able to achieve with what's
 
02:40:45.309 --> 02:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
written in the Bill thank you for your
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
question question yet um because it's an
 
02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
input based system that would be very
 
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
difficult to determine and again
 
02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
especially without a fiscal note to
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
determine what kind of resources are
 
02:40:58.110 --> 02:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
going to be targeted to those most at
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
risk students thank
 
02:41:03.389 --> 02:41:03.399 align:start position:0%
you than you any further questions from
 
02:41:03.399 --> 02:41:05.190 align:start position:0%

in this bill obviously by name and I'm
 
02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if the department of UC tion
 
02:42:18.469 --> 02:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
has given any feedback as to where
 
02:42:20.950 --> 02:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
social emotional learning fits into the
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
education uh we have not because it's
 
02:42:30.389 --> 02:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
not specifically called out here uh in
 
02:42:33.230 --> 02:42:33.240 align:start position:0%

oh sorry resident blus One More Mr
 
02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
Green I was just wondering what the
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
comments made earlier about um the
 
02:42:58.510 --> 02:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education being
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed as it is do
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
you what are your thoughts on that as to
 
02:43:12.269 --> 02:43:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
actually so we do hope to create a more
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
robust School approval system that's
 
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
based upon the minimum standards and the
 
02:43:21.309 --> 02:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
school approval standards that are
 
02:43:24.190 --> 02:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
currently outlined uh in the RSA and in
 
02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
the 8306 the administrative rules here
 
02:43:28.990 --> 02:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
with the Department um we do have a
 
02:43:31.790 --> 02:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
position for a school approval person um
 
02:43:33.389 --> 02:43:33.399 align:start position:0%
that we've recently hired for that
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
individual will be starting at the
 
02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
department on July 1 so I'm hopeful that
 
02:43:38.950 --> 02:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
bringing on that full-time position
 
02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
starting in July will help to alleviate
 
02:43:42.910 --> 02:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
some of the burden that the department
 
02:43:46.670 --> 02:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
has thank you very much
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
you once only twice I don't see anyone
 
02:43:58.910 --> 02:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
further thank you Mr and thank you Mr
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
chairman with that I'll conclude the
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on HP
 
02:44:09.230 --> 02:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
242 and I guess we can break for lunch
 
02:44:13.389 --> 02:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
at this point and come back 1:00 for
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.160 --> 02:45:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.080 --> 03:58:51.429 align:start position:0%
 
know

03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:51.439 --> 03:58:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
somewhere

03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:58:56.550 --> 03:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
else okay good afternoon to everybody
 
03:58:59.309 --> 03:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
that's out there on in remote and those
 
03:59:03.910 --> 03:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
is we're ready to go ahead with this
 
03:59:10.510 --> 03:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh hearings we have two
 
03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled the first of which is HD
 
03:59:19.030 --> 03:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
320 and uh with that I'd like to
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
recognize representative M Prime sponsor
 
03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman uh for the record
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh I am representative Mike morett Marat
 
03:59:33.870 --> 03:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
District 9 which includes uh and L
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
NASCAR country um we spent a lot of time
 
03:59:40.910 --> 03:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
today talking talking about money and uh
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
this afternoon I'd like to redir a
 
03:59:45.910 --> 03:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
little bit and talk about
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
learning uh Mark Twain
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
said that everyone talks about the
 
03:59:54.429 --> 03:59:54.439 align:start position:0%
weather but nobody does anything about
 
03:59:58.429 --> 03:59:58.439 align:start position:0%
it so similarly it seems like everybody
 
04:00:01.149 --> 04:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
has talked about the wful state of
 
04:00:03.990 --> 04:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
civics knowledge amongst uh so many
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
Americans or most Americans uh but
 
04:00:11.349 --> 04:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
nobody does much about it so HB 320 here
 
04:00:13.469 --> 04:00:13.479 align:start position:0%
provides us I think with a wonderful
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to actually do something
 
04:00:18.990 --> 04:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
about it improved learning and and and
 
04:00:21.389 --> 04:00:21.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh what this major does it
 
04:00:23.950 --> 04:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
would simply require a universal Civics
 
04:00:26.590 --> 04:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
assessment is a graduation requirement
 
04:00:28.189 --> 04:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
we already have a requirement to have
 
04:00:31.630 --> 04:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
these classes but this would add a an
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
assessment to the classes simply
 
04:00:36.910 --> 04:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
utilizing the 100 question history and
 
04:00:38.950 --> 04:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
Civics examination this currently being
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
administered to prospective natural R
 
04:00:45.389 --> 04:00:45.399 align:start position:0%
citizens uh this proposal came up a
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
little bit short the last time around
 
04:00:48.750 --> 04:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
three years ago but we're hopeful that
 
04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
we can uh move it forward this year now
 
04:00:54.910 --> 04:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a a radical notion or radical
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
bill at all this exam is already a
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement in in h a good
 
04:01:03.309 --> 04:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
number of states uh Arizona raho North
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
Dakota South Dakota uh South Carolina
 
04:01:08.910 --> 04:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
Tennessee Utah Louisiana among others
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
so this is already being done so why do
 
04:01:14.870 --> 04:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
I and so many others want to see New
 
04:01:17.309 --> 04:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire join these other states in in
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh requiring this exam this this
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
instrument this
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
assessment it's because we want to do
 
04:01:26.550 --> 04:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
something about the the rful state of
 
04:01:26.560 --> 04:01:27.510 align:start position:0%
something about the the rful state of
civics

04:01:27.510 --> 04:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
civics
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge we think it's crucial that we
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
have citizens who who understand a
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
little bit hopefully a lot but at least
 
04:01:39.309 --> 04:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit about government
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh and there are countless examples one
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
can find on the internet and I won't
 
04:01:44.670 --> 04:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
share them here I can I can sense them
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
out later if you like of uh surveys
 
04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
YouTubes and and in statistics that show
 
04:01:55.790 --> 04:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
people so many people don't know
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
anything or how anything about how
 
04:02:00.070 --> 04:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
government works and to some of us
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
that's very disturbing and it's even
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
even scary some people are less worried
 
04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
about this uh this lack of knowledge of
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
the signant and and uh I'm not amongst
 
04:02:15.269 --> 04:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
them uh and I think this lack of
 
04:02:16.830 --> 04:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge reflects B on their
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
educational experience uh especially
 
04:02:21.550 --> 04:02:21.560 align:start position:0%
resonates with me because uh I a former
 
04:02:23.469 --> 04:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
Civics teacher and as someone who's
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
taught for three different colleges in
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh I've been consistently
 
04:02:28.990 --> 04:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed I've been out in those
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
trenches so to speak I've been
 
04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed if not appalled at the
 
04:02:35.349 --> 04:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
utter lack of civics knowledge displayed
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
by college students I I could give
 
04:02:40.710 --> 04:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
examples and and and I I won't at this
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
time uh now every school district
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
handles Civics education differently
 
04:02:48.510 --> 04:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
some do better than others but what this
 
04:02:50.670 --> 04:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
assessment would do would would be to
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
establish a common Baseline of
 
04:02:55.349 --> 04:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
fundamentals for all schools now what
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
concerns many of us is so many schools
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
do not give students the basic Civics
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
instruction they feel they deserve that
 
04:03:05.070 --> 04:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
they parents expect and the society
 
04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
needs and some schools conflate uh
 
04:03:11.309 --> 04:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
contemporary issues classes with Civ
 
04:03:12.790 --> 04:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
classes and they're not the same it
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the
 
04:03:16.750 --> 04:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
same um the result is that many
 
04:03:19.229 --> 04:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
so-called Civics classes end up focusing
 
04:03:22.189 --> 04:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
on talking about contemporary issues
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
climate change or whatever which is fine
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
but we think that before you start to
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
talk about some of these contemporary
 
04:03:30.910 --> 04:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
issues you should understand the
 
04:03:34.389 --> 04:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
structure of of our of our government so
 
04:03:36.630 --> 04:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
I I want to briefly respond to some Curr
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
concerns I've heard about this me uh
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
number one we should not dictate
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum actually obviously we do that
 
04:03:46.030 --> 04:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
came up this morning in terms of uh
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum that we dictate uh and we
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
should have statutes to give schools
 
04:03:53.510 --> 04:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
some Direction that's our job so I were
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
elected to the house and to the
 
04:03:57.710 --> 04:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
legislature to the education Committee
 
04:04:01.110 --> 04:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
in particular uh we already have Civic
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
requirements in the books I co-sponsored
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
one of them Senator Dallas Ando earlier
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
now this Bo would provide some
 
04:04:10.830 --> 04:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
now Senator Dallas Sanders B I support
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
and signed on but it it didn't have any
 
04:04:16.510 --> 04:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
specific uh requirements other than you
 
04:04:19.469 --> 04:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
need to have the class so this I think
 
04:04:23.670 --> 04:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
enhances Senator Dallas Sandro's earlier
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
intent um and as mentioned earlier many
 
04:04:29.550 --> 04:04:29.560 align:start position:0%
states already do this I don't think we
 
04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
should mandate for example every St to
 
04:04:33.630 --> 04:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
take a French class or a trigonometry
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
class but I do think it's our
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to expect the high school
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
graduate of some basic Bic language
 
04:04:42.309 --> 04:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
English skills and a basic knowledge of
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
civics uh number two uh the second
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
concern iocc that this is a stressful
 
04:04:51.469 --> 04:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary quote unquote high
 
04:04:51.479 --> 04:04:52.790 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary quote unquote high
stakes

04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
stakes
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
requirement uh it's arguably high stakes
 
04:04:57.389 --> 04:04:57.399 align:start position:0%
I suppose in that we want it to be a
 
04:05:00.429 --> 04:05:00.439 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement but the testable
 
04:05:03.070 --> 04:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
material is out there it's very easy to
 
04:05:05.070 --> 04:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
study for students have the questions
 
04:05:07.070 --> 04:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
and the answers ahead of time many
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
fourth graders and eighth graders if
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
this moves through uh fourth graders and
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
eighth graders uh can take and satisfy
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
this requirement even before high school
 
04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I think this would be a source of
 
04:05:20.349 --> 04:05:20.359 align:start position:0%
Pride for them and their families and
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
their schools uh it's one of my High
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
School principles used to also say
 
04:05:27.469 --> 04:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
students deserve a chance to fail I
 
04:05:29.790 --> 04:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
think shielding students from from
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
failure or from challenges does them no
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
favors and this allows of course local
 
04:05:38.670 --> 04:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility in administering to special
 
04:05:38.680 --> 04:05:39.990 align:start position:0%
flexibility in administering to special
needs

04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
students and number three concern uh
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
that this measure will encourage again
 
04:05:49.710 --> 04:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
quote unquote teaching to the test uh
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
those are education I know that the the
 
04:05:56.030 --> 04:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
notion of teaching to the test is kind
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
of a pejorative expression uh it's often
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
used by those who are frankly threatened
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
by assessments and they're threatened by
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
accountability uh teaching to the test
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
is not a bad thing I it's
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
driver ed instructors teach to the test
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's called the driver's
 
04:06:16.110 --> 04:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
exam law professors teach to the test
 
04:06:17.590 --> 04:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's called The Pri
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
exam uh I at the nhti uh the
 
04:06:26.469 --> 04:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
radiography uh professors there teach to
 
04:06:28.030 --> 04:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
the test it's called the national
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
registry exam for x-ray text and I want
 
04:06:33.550 --> 04:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
somebody take my Ed who have studied for
 
04:06:36.269 --> 04:06:36.279 align:start position:0%
that test so this this teaching to the
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
test thing is something that I just
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't don't uh I don't buy so anyway
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
mapping this up I say if this is the
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
type of measure that parents want that
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
many of us want that our country needs I
 
04:06:51.590 --> 04:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
think and someone who believes in and
 
04:06:54.149 --> 04:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
supports public education this is very
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
important because I I'm a product of
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
publication public education I've taught
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
in public schools kids went to Public
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
Schools we need public schools and we
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
need to support public schools and we
 
04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
need people to support public schools
 
04:07:09.309 --> 04:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
and I know that we've all been seeing
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
examples and concerns with people who
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
have lost some confidence in public
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
schools so if you support Public Schools
 
04:07:19.070 --> 04:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
here's a great opportunity to do
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
something that will help increase
 
04:07:23.790 --> 04:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
confidence and support for public
 
04:07:27.070 --> 04:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
schools with this little measure that
 
04:07:29.229 --> 04:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
provides assessment and a little bit of
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
accountability uh I mentioned Senator
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
Dallas c i co-p to similar measures in
 
04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
the past when I brought this up last
 
04:07:38.149 --> 04:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
time on Sunday Mark full Clark uh from
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
the other party as a co-sponsor so this
 
04:07:42.550 --> 04:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
is a bill that has sponsorship and
 
04:07:44.950 --> 04:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
support from both parties it's a nice
 
04:07:47.670 --> 04:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for bipartisanship that I
 
04:07:52.109 --> 04:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
hope will not be lost and finally uh in
 
04:07:54.030 --> 04:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
closing I want to come back to the late
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
Mary guile who we all know uh she once
 
04:08:00.429 --> 04:08:00.439 align:start position:0%
chaired this committee uh Mary was a
 
04:08:02.790 --> 04:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
friend and a colleague of mine for many
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
years going back when we were both at
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
nhti in fact she also used the photo
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
that I took for for her first campaign
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
brochure back in
 
04:08:14.830 --> 04:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
1996 anyway when uh this B first came
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
left three years ago Mary representative
 
04:08:19.630 --> 04:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
God was very excited about it that
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
version of this committee after I gave
 
04:08:22.159 --> 04:08:23.469 align:start position:0%
version of this committee after I gave
similar

04:08:23.469 --> 04:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
similar
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
testimony uh she spoke up and waxed
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
eloquent about what a great idea she
 
04:08:30.429 --> 04:08:30.439 align:start position:0%
thought it was and and some of you know
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
Mary is a
 
04:08:34.510 --> 04:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
Canadian uh represent of God came to
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
America became the naturalized citizen
 
04:08:39.309 --> 04:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
and in so doing she had to satisfy some
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
some similar testing requirements to
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
become a citizen so you're on on about
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh how much she thought this was a great
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
idea but uh when it came to exec session
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
she voted against it and I understand
 
04:08:58.109 --> 04:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
why uh our party's caucus uh before exec
 
04:09:00.189 --> 04:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
sessions caucus just came up with
 
04:09:02.670 --> 04:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
represent Val talking about this during
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
the break uh he knew where a caucus once
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
in high school because he had a civics
 
04:09:10.229 --> 04:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
class in high school school so parties
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
we we both caucus before exec session
 
04:09:14.790 --> 04:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
and we pretty much come to exec session
 
04:09:16.030 --> 04:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
knowing how we're going to vote and
 
04:09:18.750 --> 04:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
that's our system um and I think
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
caucuses might be an interesting topic
 
04:09:23.229 --> 04:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
for civics classes and for students to
 
04:09:26.510 --> 04:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
understand better but after the students
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
have taken our naturalization and the
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
assessment test and know maybe a little
 
04:09:33.229 --> 04:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
bit about government so right thanks for
 
04:09:35.309 --> 04:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
your patience and forbearance and I I'd
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions thank
 
04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
very much uh representative M are there
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
any questions for representa yes uh
 
04:09:46.550 --> 04:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
represent oh excuse
 
04:09:49.149 --> 04:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
me my class is on
 
04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
here did you recognize me Mr chairman
 
04:09:54.030 --> 04:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
yes I did okay thank you thank you Mr
 
04:09:55.229 --> 04:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and and thank you
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative for uh taking uh the
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
question um I certainly share with you
 
04:10:02.790 --> 04:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh your concern about the lack of uh
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
Civics knowledge or even historical
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge I teach history and uh I can
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
vouch for what you're saying um but I do
 
04:10:13.950 --> 04:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
have some concerns here
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
um you noted that um the answers are all
 
04:10:18.990 --> 04:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
out there and I've looked it up I mean
 
04:10:22.109 --> 04:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
you can find them anywhere on the web um
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
to theuh 2020
 
04:10:27.309 --> 04:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
exam uh so my question is uh at least
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
initial question is what is it that
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
students will learn I mean all they need
 
04:10:33.149 --> 04:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
to do is just look at it online memorize
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
the answers and that's it they can take
 
04:10:36.790 --> 04:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
the test and they will probably pass it
 
04:10:39.309 --> 04:10:39.319 align:start position:0%
I had a test like that in college where
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the Prof gave us all the answers in
 
04:10:42.990 --> 04:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
advance I don't remember a single damn
 
04:10:45.149 --> 04:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
thing from it uh because he gave us
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
everything in advance and that seems to
 
04:10:48.590 --> 04:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
be what would happen here so how would
 
04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
you um characterize this as rigorous
 
04:10:52.229 --> 04:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
academic study if all the answers are
 
04:10:54.910 --> 04:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
out there and available in advance sure
 
04:10:56.670 --> 04:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
representative I thank you for your
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
question I said it was rigorous academic
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
study I think it really is is is pretty
 
04:11:06.269 --> 04:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
easy uh it it it's pretty much Basics uh
 
04:11:09.790 --> 04:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
to your point um I think that students
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh need that broad Baseline now I know
 
04:11:14.830 --> 04:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
and I've taught as you know in several
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
colleges as well and one of my concerns
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
is that uh oftentimes in in college
 
04:11:24.830 --> 04:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
classes uh student students or or
 
04:11:26.910 --> 04:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
professors will talk about certain
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
things that require a knowledge for
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
example to go back to the the climate
 
04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
change thing I mentioned before uh if
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
some contemporary issue class or class
 
04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
is talking about climate change and
 
04:11:42.269 --> 04:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
people say we need a law yeah we need to
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
do this uh well I think that if if some
 
04:11:48.910 --> 04:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
of these classes encourage some activism
 
04:11:50.990 --> 04:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
which is good if the students talking
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
about climate change don't know how to
 
04:11:55.950 --> 04:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
take action in terms of uh influencing
 
04:11:57.870 --> 04:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
their legislature if they don't
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
understand about uh how a blow becomes a
 
04:12:03.229 --> 04:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
law I mean look what we're doing here uh
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
I I think that these are just Basics
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to build on to to do what
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about I think which is to
 
04:12:13.389 --> 04:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
have higher level uh you know uh
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
pedagogical uh
 
04:12:17.790 --> 04:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
experiences Mr chairman just a brief
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
followup yes you may thank you Mr
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you again for taking
 
04:12:25.070 --> 04:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
the question um the Naturalization exam
 
04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
as it's currently administered my
 
04:12:27.950 --> 04:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that for in order for
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
one to pass it um and be eligible for
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship you need that you'll only be
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
asked 20 out of the 128 questions and
 
04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
you need to answer only 12 of those
 
04:12:40.269 --> 04:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
those 20 correctly I.E a grade of 60 so
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
um is there any particular reason why uh
 
04:12:44.670 --> 04:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
you want to have the students take all
 
04:12:47.870 --> 04:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
128 questions and attain a grade of 70
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
which in my structure would be a c minus
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you sure that's thank you that's a
 
04:12:56.389 --> 04:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
good question and you're correct uh the
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
the 100 questions are out there of which
 
04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
the prospective citizens uh as you said
 
04:13:03.710 --> 04:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
do take 20 they need pass up that's the
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
standard for uh you know immigrants some
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
whom obviously didn't go to school here
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
and maybe have some language
 
04:13:13.510 --> 04:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
requirements I think to have a a
 
04:13:16.510 --> 04:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat higher bar for New
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire high school graduates uh is
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
important and uh and it's not a very
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
high B in the the perspective
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
naturalization students uh presumably
 
04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
would have to study all 100 questions uh
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
of course they don't know which uh which
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
12 they would get it's like a driver's
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
test you study whole driver's manual and
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully know the whole driver's manual
 
04:13:43.269 --> 04:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
and then you get uh 20 Questions out of
 
04:13:45.469 --> 04:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
that so uh yeah I think it's a very
 
04:13:47.790 --> 04:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
little bar 100 questions 100 pieces of
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge of civics government in
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
history uh that uh I think uh would be
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
good for everybody to the study some
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
schools do but my concern is are the mle
 
04:14:00.269 --> 04:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
schools that really don't do as well as
 
04:14:04.349 --> 04:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
they should here in my view thank
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much uh are there any
 
04:14:07.600 --> 04:14:08.990 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much uh are there any
further

04:14:08.990 --> 04:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:14:13.389 --> 04:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the L uh thank you Mr
 
04:14:15.550 --> 04:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
chairman there's no there's no question
 
04:14:18.109 --> 04:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
that that civic's knowledge is very
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
important in fact I I was thinking as
 
04:14:22.429 --> 04:14:22.439 align:start position:0%
you were making your testimony represent
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
Moffet that perhaps uh a requirement
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
must be for representatives in this uh
 
04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
August house should pass that exam
 
04:14:34.870 --> 04:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
before they become uh officially
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
recognized as a representative but as
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's another issue the question I have
 
04:14:43.710 --> 04:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
for you is that it it appears to me that
 
04:14:47.670 --> 04:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
this is now a high state test for
 
04:14:49.990 --> 04:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
students and I just need need a
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
clarification because once a student has
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
passed all their other course
 
04:14:57.630 --> 04:14:57.640 align:start position:0%
requirements etc etc that they have this
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
one exam that they have to take in order
 
04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
to to get graduation is that correct is
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
this you consider this a high stake test
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
because you have to pass it in order to
 
04:15:10.109 --> 04:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
get your graduation
 
04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
certificate yeah thank you Mil uh I
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
actually spoke directly to that earlier
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
I specifically mentioned that this would
 
04:15:19.550 --> 04:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
be perceived as a high stakes test and
 
04:15:22.189 --> 04:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
it it is uh obviously if this is a
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement uh yes it is a
 
04:15:28.389 --> 04:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
high stakes test in that sense I don't
 
04:15:29.950 --> 04:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a hard test I think it's a
 
04:15:32.830 --> 04:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
very very easy test as I said uh I think
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
fourth graders and eighth graders uh
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
probably cannot if if this moves forward
 
04:15:40.269 --> 04:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh junior high students can knock off
 
04:15:43.389 --> 04:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
this requirement uh in some cases would
 
04:15:46.109 --> 04:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
a would a senior still need in some
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
school to take it over whatever that
 
04:15:52.910 --> 04:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
probably will happen uh and that's okay
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
um and as far as legislators taking this
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
exam uh I had a very similar thought
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
that you had and I I did not give
 
04:16:02.149 --> 04:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
expression to it but I'm glad that you
 
04:16:05.950 --> 04:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
did well just as a as a followup so if
 
04:16:08.830 --> 04:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
if in fact a student were to take this
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
exam let's say in the e8th
 
04:16:14.109 --> 04:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
grade and pass the exam
 
04:16:17.189 --> 04:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
then would they have to take it
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
again after the 12th year of of
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
studying h no not is uh our intent is
 
04:16:26.590 --> 04:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
that at some point uh someone take and
 
04:16:28.670 --> 04:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
pass this exam and get that Baseline of
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge we know fourth graders and
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
e8th graders uh you know we see a lot of
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
fourth graders we used to here at the
 
04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
state house because that's a fourth
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
grade class class uh I think fourth
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
graders could take this and pass it and
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
knock it off and the school district
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
would have a record of it and I think it
 
04:16:45.910 --> 04:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
would be a wonderful source of Pride I
 
04:16:47.389 --> 04:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
think that would create a great deal of
 
04:16:49.710 --> 04:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
excitement for fourth graders or eighth
 
04:16:51.710 --> 04:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
graders to compare schools and study for
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
this and and uh honestly I think this
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
requirement in many districts could
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
probably be knocked off in uh in junior
 
04:17:02.429 --> 04:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
high school but but this isn't part of
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
your bill at this point in time correct
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh correct it's the bill is very short
 
04:17:10.510 --> 04:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
simple and hopefully sweet uh it just
 
04:17:12.510 --> 04:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
asks that the school districts uh have
 
04:17:15.550 --> 04:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
this uh assessment as a graduation
 
04:17:19.630 --> 04:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
requirement at some point yes thank you
 
04:17:22.030 --> 04:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
are there further questions represent
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing this
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
forward uh again um I think it would be
 
04:17:33.670 --> 04:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
interesting to have uh Representatives
 
04:17:37.469 --> 04:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
take uh the assistantship test but but I
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
think even more appropriate might be a
 
04:17:41.229 --> 04:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
test on the
 
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution um uh the
 
04:17:49.630 --> 04:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
other thing I wanted to ask about was um
 
04:17:52.830 --> 04:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
if the student does not reach the grade
 
04:17:52.840 --> 04:17:53.950 align:start position:0%
if the student does not reach the grade
of

04:17:53.950 --> 04:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:17:59.349 --> 04:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
70 um on this test um it would be U
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
allowed there would be nothing to
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
prevent them from taking it again or
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
possibly a third time if necessary is
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
that correct sure it's a uh I I think
 
04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
that the assumption is that students can
 
04:18:14.910 --> 04:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
have as many shots at it as they need I
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
think like I said it's not a hard test
 
04:18:19.109 --> 04:18:19.119 align:start position:0%
most people will do it easily some
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
special needs kids who have special
 
04:18:22.510 --> 04:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
accommodations and that would be up to
 
04:18:27.189 --> 04:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
the districts to uh to to make happen um
 
04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
but sure if somebody needs to take it a
 
04:18:33.389 --> 04:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
number of times uh John F Kennedy Jr if
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
you remember flun the buyers in then he
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
flunked it again and reason we know that
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
is because he was you know the hunk
 
04:18:42.670 --> 04:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
flunk we get a lot of attention but um
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it's like a
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
bar much easier sure I I students could
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
take it as many times as they as they
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
needed so that takes a lot of the
 
04:18:53.550 --> 04:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
pressure off of this this high stakes
 
04:18:55.109 --> 04:18:55.119 align:start position:0%
concern in my
 
04:18:59.109 --> 04:18:59.119 align:start position:0%
view yes you have follow thank you um So
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said I think
 
04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
rather than teaching to the test
 
04:19:05.229 --> 04:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be more like learning to the
 
04:19:08.109 --> 04:19:08.119 align:start position:0%
test I like that yeah uh learning to the
 
04:19:11.149 --> 04:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
test is yeah in fact this is a test it
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
really doesn't need to be taught it
 
04:19:15.630 --> 04:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be studied the material is
 
04:19:18.109 --> 04:19:18.119 align:start position:0%
there study it learn it and hopefully
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
part of this process is uh this basic
 
04:19:24.030 --> 04:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge Foundation is grown it'll
 
04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
excite some students to ask questions
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the some of the basics of uh
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
tripod tyte government or whatever and
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
get them excited about uh government and
 
04:19:38.189 --> 04:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
history and uh and become better
 
04:19:38.199 --> 04:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
history and uh and become better
citizens

04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
04:19:42.750 --> 04:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately thank you very much uh
 
04:19:42.760 --> 04:19:46.229 align:start position:0%
ultimately thank you very much uh
representative

04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:48.429 --> 04:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
Corell thank you and thank you for
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if you're a senior
 
04:19:55.030 --> 04:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
you've passed all your classes um it
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
worked really hard because you're not
 
04:19:58.269 --> 04:19:58.279 align:start position:0%
that great of a student but you've
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
worked really really hard um it comes to
 
04:20:04.349 --> 04:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
the end you've been accepted into a
 
04:20:06.670 --> 04:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
college and then you don't pass this
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
test so you don't get your high school
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
diploma you probably can't go on to
 
04:20:14.710 --> 04:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
college so what do you do for the next
 
04:20:16.790 --> 04:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
year when you've passed all your classes
 
04:20:19.109 --> 04:20:19.119 align:start position:0%
but you haven't passed this test do you
 
04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
go back to high school and just keep
 
04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
taking this test or what do you do for
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
year yes thank you we cor uh yeah we we
 
04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
anticipated that type of question I
 
04:20:32.910 --> 04:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
tried to address it in my earlier
 
04:20:35.349 --> 04:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
remarks and my earlier statements uh
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
that scenario uh theoretically Could
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
Happen uh but some it depends on every s
 
04:20:44.750 --> 04:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
i again I Envision this being taken care
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
of uh in eighth grade or ninth grade but
 
04:20:51.870 --> 04:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
if for some reason some senior uh and
 
04:20:53.830 --> 04:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
this is on them if they if they didn't
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
study for it didn't take it if the
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
school would make sure that they took it
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh what you described could happen and
 
04:21:01.389 --> 04:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
if that did happen I think that that
 
04:21:03.109 --> 04:21:03.119 align:start position:0%
might be a wonderful lesson for that
 
04:21:06.109 --> 04:21:06.119 align:start position:0%
student to uh to do a little bit better
 
04:21:07.510 --> 04:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
planning but I I don't think that would
 
04:21:08.910 --> 04:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
ever happen I think that guidance
 
04:21:11.429 --> 04:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
counselors and teachers and the school
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
you know if this is a ninth grade
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
requirement or an eighth grade
 
04:21:17.070 --> 04:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
requirement uh I don't think the the
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
notion of the scenario of the scor as
 
04:21:22.109 --> 04:21:22.119 align:start position:0%
you described uh that I don't think that
 
04:21:25.309 --> 04:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
would be a showstopper um but thank you
 
04:21:26.950 --> 04:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
for for the question it is something we
 
04:21:30.429 --> 04:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
thought about sure followup yes
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
you um it doesn't anywhere mention
 
04:21:36.910 --> 04:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
Public Charter School in this it just
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
says schools so would this also be a
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
requirement for a a charter school for
 
04:21:45.630 --> 04:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
graduation Because unless something
 
04:21:49.070 --> 04:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
specifically says Public Charter School
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't apply to
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
them thank you for the question um I
 
04:21:55.790 --> 04:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
look at the wording again the intendance
 
04:21:57.950 --> 04:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
for public schools as you know charter
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
schools are public schools uh and well
 
04:22:04.109 --> 04:22:04.119 align:start position:0%
it's a very short bet we look at the
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
word again and make sure that it's uh
 
04:22:09.550 --> 04:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
it's clear if we need to find T and will
 
04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
to before exec session we we certainly
 
04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
will but yes uh the expectation is that
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know any appr approved school
 
04:22:21.149 --> 04:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
that uh in New Hampshire be it chartered
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
public or public uh this is a
 
04:22:26.670 --> 04:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that we would like to have
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh on all all all schools
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you very
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
much thank you m chairman a lot of
 
04:22:40.349 --> 04:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
schools high schools
 
04:22:43.630 --> 04:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
accept stud that taking the eth grade
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
but this be one of those things that
 
04:22:47.590 --> 04:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
could have been done in eth grade in the
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
high school would then accept that great
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
yes good question represent B every
 
04:22:55.149 --> 04:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
district is different uh I know when I
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
was in in uh eighth grade I was able to
 
04:23:03.870 --> 04:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
take a French class in in my district it
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
it a lot because there was an upper Lev
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
French class I get high school credit
 
04:23:09.750 --> 04:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
for it so to answer your question it's
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
up to the districts but absolutely I
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
would think that as I've said earlier
 
04:23:16.870 --> 04:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
that uh it's not a class it's a test and
 
04:23:19.070 --> 04:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
so if you pass a test if you pass a
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
driver's test when you're 16 it's uh you
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
know even better than passion when
 
04:23:28.149 --> 04:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
you're 18 so yes to your
 
04:23:28.159 --> 04:23:30.389 align:start position:0%
you're 18 so yes to your
question

04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:23:33.070 --> 04:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
04:23:34.469 --> 04:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
question um I actually have two with
 
04:23:39.429 --> 04:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
them but if I read the the New Hampshire
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
requirements correctly we already have a
 
04:23:45.109 --> 04:23:45.119 align:start position:0%
half credit requirement in Civics
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
education already is that
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
correct yes I I believe that so yes that
 
04:23:53.109 --> 04:23:53.119 align:start position:0%
Senator Dallas sand actually as I
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned ear here and I uh uh got a doe
 
04:24:00.109 --> 04:24:00.119 align:start position:0%
to that to that effect into statute yes
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay so my followup question my m is the
 
04:24:05.550 --> 04:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
chair that regards that what uh my
 
04:24:08.189 --> 04:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
concern is two parts a what would you
 
04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
what would you take out of the current
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
Civic curriculum that they're trying to
 
04:24:13.550 --> 04:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
get in there in half a year uh to put
 
04:24:15.149 --> 04:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
this test to training of this test in
 
04:24:17.910 --> 04:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
there uh that's the the first part and
 
04:24:21.030 --> 04:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
secondly uh what happens to the concept
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
of local control of content and
 
04:24:26.189 --> 04:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum thank you for for the
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
question uh nothing would need to be
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
changed in terms of curriculum this is
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
just a a test that could be given could
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
be given via Blackboard it could be
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
given Junior High School uh it's no need
 
04:24:39.389 --> 04:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
to for any school district to adjust its
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum whatsoever uh they just would
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
need to in some fashion that's up to the
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
local control up to the district to uh
 
04:24:49.830 --> 04:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
administer this assessment at some point
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
in during the student's Journey uh so we
 
04:24:56.590 --> 04:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
have no impact on existing curriculum or
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
or Civic instruction uh one of the
 
04:25:01.830 --> 04:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
concerns is I alluded to earlier is that
 
04:25:05.710 --> 04:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
yes we have Civic classes but candidly
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
some schools do better all schools teach
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
it differently and some some schools and
 
04:25:13.830 --> 04:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
again my experience in teaching with
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
three different colleges has been uh
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
that I I'm concerned that many classes
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
don't cover some of the the basics so
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
that no change to curriculum this is
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
just an assessment that could be
 
04:25:29.149 --> 04:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
administered at the uh discretion of the
 
04:25:29.159 --> 04:25:30.750 align:start position:0%
administered at the uh discretion of the
school

04:25:30.750 --> 04:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
district follow up Mr chairman yes go
 
04:25:36.750 --> 04:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chairman So based on
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
that representative if if it's not going
 
04:25:40.469 --> 04:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
to be something taking out of the
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
curriculum to fill a time span then it's
 
04:25:45.109 --> 04:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
could be it's going to be a standalone
 
04:25:47.349 --> 04:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
test because obviously the
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum time in the classroom is
 
04:25:52.510 --> 04:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
already complete so we have to we can't
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
add more time so we have to take
 
04:25:56.429 --> 04:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
something out of the curriculum so if
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a standalone test it
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to be in would
 
04:26:01.550 --> 04:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
be in service class just a requirement
 
04:26:03.990 --> 04:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
for high school graduation
 
04:26:07.750 --> 04:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
period is that correct thank you repr of
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question and it
 
04:26:11.550 --> 04:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
basically it comes down to time
 
04:26:14.269 --> 04:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
management for example uh you know
 
04:26:17.590 --> 04:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh gues counselors or whatever
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
ask teachers to uh administer some sort
 
04:26:24.950 --> 04:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
of uh questionnaire assessment exam or
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
whatever and uh is is is required as
 
04:26:31.590 --> 04:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
comes up and so it's a simple case of
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
time management I don't think that this
 
04:26:36.269 --> 04:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
involves uh taking anything out of
 
04:26:38.670 --> 04:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
existing curriculum whatsoever uh it's
 
04:26:40.710 --> 04:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
just something that needs to be worked
 
04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
in in some fashion I I want to leave
 
04:26:47.109 --> 04:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
that up to uh schools and classes to
 
04:26:49.950 --> 04:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
integrate uh I think this is a test that
 
04:26:51.670 --> 04:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
some people can take in 15 minutes
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
really if they've settled for it they
 
04:26:56.349 --> 04:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
zip out for it so the the notion of the
 
04:26:59.309 --> 04:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
concern of this you know preempting
 
04:27:04.349 --> 04:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
other uh learning uh really is is not
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
not a significant issue I I not BL Mr
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
chair I just make one final comment
 
04:27:11.590 --> 04:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative based on that if this is
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
going to be that high stakes of an
 
04:27:16.030 --> 04:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
examination the kids cannot graduate
 
04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
from high school without passing I don't
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
think there's any school that's going to
 
04:27:20.670 --> 04:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
just put it aside and give them 15
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
minutes you move this to the highest
 
04:27:24.309 --> 04:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
level of the of the
 
04:27:26.030 --> 04:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
diploma thank
 
04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you uh I again the schools
 
04:27:33.349 --> 04:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
can do this they want you know 15
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
minutes my my point is that many
 
04:27:38.349 --> 04:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
students will finish in 15 minutes
 
04:27:41.229 --> 04:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
because it's it's it's not that hard
 
04:27:44.149 --> 04:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
really for most students uh but no I was
 
04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that that a class uh
 
04:27:49.990 --> 04:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
allocate 15 minutes for 100 question
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
assessment um that that was my point my
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
point is it's just uh shouldn't take
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
very much time at all to to
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
administer thank you very much I have a
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
question for you representative Mar uh
 
04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
and it's directed at the intent of this
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
bill currently under the under current
 
04:28:11.469 --> 04:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
legislation the school district or
 
04:28:13.630 --> 04:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
school can administer a locally designed
 
04:28:13.640 --> 04:28:15.109 align:start position:0%
school can administer a locally designed
competency

04:28:15.109 --> 04:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
competency
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
assessment uh then if they opt not to
 
04:28:21.389 --> 04:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
use that they may use the citizenship
 
04:28:24.750 --> 04:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
and the immigration uh test has
 
04:28:26.429 --> 04:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
developed by the United States
 
04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
citizenship or by the US
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
CIS is it your intent that they have to
 
04:28:34.910 --> 04:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
pass both of those whereas in the past
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
you if you pass the local test then you
 
04:28:41.229 --> 04:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
did you know they may not use the other
 
04:28:43.750 --> 04:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
test or they may opt to use the
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
citizenship test if they didn't use a
 
04:28:48.630 --> 04:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
local test now in your legislation
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking for the local assessment
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
test to be passed and the immigration
 
04:28:58.469 --> 04:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
test is that your intent yes uh Mr chair
 
04:29:00.590 --> 04:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
that is the intent the intent is that
 
04:29:03.070 --> 04:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
every student in in New Hampshire uh
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
have a chance to take and do take this
 
04:29:10.990 --> 04:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh 100 question test uh in addition and
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
I understand existing statute uh does
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
have some provision for locally admin
 
04:29:18.510 --> 04:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
administered tests again the concern is
 
04:29:21.910 --> 04:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
that some localities do better than
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
others at uh at these locally developed
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
instruments or assessments so this
 
04:29:29.229 --> 04:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
Common Assessment uh which would be
 
04:29:32.070 --> 04:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
common everybody the intent to your
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
question is that yes every student take
 
04:29:37.309 --> 04:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
it and also uh to an earlier question
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
with regard to I believe was
 
04:29:40.269 --> 04:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell had asked about
 
04:29:44.750 --> 04:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
if this applies to uh Charter Schools uh
 
04:29:49.710 --> 04:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
RSA 189 col11 section one that does
 
04:29:54.910 --> 04:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
refer to uh requirements like this uh
 
04:29:57.710 --> 04:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
being applied to all public and and
 
04:30:01.630 --> 04:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
private schools in the state uh thank
 
04:30:03.229 --> 04:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
you for your questions thank you very
 
04:30:06.510 --> 04:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
much uh representative B thank you Mr
 
04:30:07.750 --> 04:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking a
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
question back to mentioned before about
 
04:30:13.469 --> 04:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
local control so could be the local
 
04:30:15.710 --> 04:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
school district decides that we will
 
04:30:19.830 --> 04:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
make this test as part of our
 
04:30:23.389 --> 04:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
Civics that also be done sure I think
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
that uh makes a lot of sense uh again we
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
want to let the should this move forward
 
04:30:30.349 --> 04:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
we want to let the districts locally
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
decide how to implement it but uh Civic
 
04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
exam uh it's C some government history
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
is part of this but it's part of a uh
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.600 --> 04:30:48.309 align:start position:0%
 
natural

04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
natural
 
04:30:48.319 --> 04:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
natural
questions

04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
Lake thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
one is just simply actually just a
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
technical suggestion um you the bill
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
refers to the 100 question test it's
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
actually 128 questions as of 2020
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
not 100 so you you you'll probably need
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
to change that um I'm still a bit and I
 
04:31:14.750 --> 04:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
know Mr chairman you asked about this
 
04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm still trying to get my head
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
around this so that there's the idea
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
here is that the student must pass
 
04:31:25.950 --> 04:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
two tests one is a sort of or two
 
04:31:27.710 --> 04:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
assessments one is a competency
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
assessment that can be developed locally
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
and the other is the um the immigration
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
test um and in the past we have allowed
 
04:31:40.189 --> 04:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
districts to substitute the immigration
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
test for the local competency locally
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
designed competency um given those that
 
04:31:47.109 --> 04:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
are given that that option's been
 
04:31:49.670 --> 04:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
available do we have any data at
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
all on how students have done on the
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
immigration test here in New Hampshire I
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't know how long that requirements or
 
04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
that that's been in place but I'm just
 
04:32:01.870 --> 04:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if we have any data yeah thank
 
04:32:06.510 --> 04:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
you uh I I do not know
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
at this time I couldn't tell you the
 
04:32:10.990 --> 04:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
data in terms of what schools uh do what
 
04:32:13.950 --> 04:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
assessments so how many already have
 
04:32:17.149 --> 04:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
have uh utilized this uh naturalization
 
04:32:20.109 --> 04:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
requirement uh but that's a a very good
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
point that this came up the last time on
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
someone asked a similar question about
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
data and um I I think that if or when
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
this does become uh a practice a
 
04:32:33.389 --> 04:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
required practice uh that will give us
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
data because schools can then tell us
 
04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know how many students took the
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
test how many had to retake it in in
 
04:32:44.109 --> 04:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
percentages like that in in terms of the
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
locally developed assessments they're
 
04:32:47.550 --> 04:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
certainly you know free to do whatever
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
they've been doing uh in terms of
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
locally developed assessments there's
 
04:32:54.670 --> 04:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
been a wide range of those and again
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
some schools have done much better than
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
others and again this one would would
 
04:33:01.950 --> 04:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
just give a common experience to to
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
every school thank you uh other
 
04:33:08.990 --> 04:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay we do have several
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
several attendees that would uh that are
 
04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
not on the participant
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
list panelist list excuse
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
me okay so bfield are
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
you there yes can you hear me yes I do
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
oh perfect uh so for the record my name
 
04:33:31.269 --> 04:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
is anarie Banfield and I'm an advocate
 
04:33:32.949 --> 04:33:32.959 align:start position:0%
for parental rights and academic
 
04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
excellence and education uh today I do
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
come here in support of HB
 
04:33:40.189 --> 04:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
320 so I have to ask you how many times
 
04:33:41.551 --> 04:33:41.561 align:start position:0%
you have seen the man on the street
 
04:33:43.949 --> 04:33:43.959 align:start position:0%
interviews with adults who cannot answer
 
04:33:46.750 --> 04:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
basic questions on Civics this is why
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justices so Sonia sodar
 
04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
and Neil Gorsuch have been advocating
 
04:33:54.990 --> 04:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
for civics education in schools and
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
believe that it should be a mandatory
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
04:34:00.029 --> 04:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
curriculum for those who continually
 
04:34:03.150 --> 04:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
talk about supporting P public education
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
this is a way to do it impr improving
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
literacy in a core academic subject is
 
04:34:10.990 --> 04:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
how we all work together to improve
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
public schools in New Hampshire the test
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
requires students to know some basic
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
information on us Civics and HB 320
 
04:34:20.830 --> 04:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
requires students to receive a passing
 
04:34:24.109 --> 04:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
grade this test is not a replacement for
 
04:34:27.310 --> 04:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
a good Civics program and good social
 
04:34:29.470 --> 04:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
study standards can assist in developing
 
04:34:29.480 --> 04:34:30.670 align:start position:0%
study standards can assist in developing
excellent

04:34:30.670 --> 04:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum several states have already
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
enacted laws that require passage of the
 
04:34:37.910 --> 04:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
test in all schools this would mean that
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students would be required
 
04:34:41.830 --> 04:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
to have the same basis of knowledge in
 
04:34:44.189 --> 04:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
Civics currently there are no State
 
04:34:45.949 --> 04:34:45.959 align:start position:0%
standardized tests in New Hampshire on
 
04:34:49.310 --> 04:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
social studies State standardized tests
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
and with over and with an overemphasis
 
04:34:54.189 --> 04:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
on stem and Workforce training our own
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Justices are seeing the
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
problem this has created parents and
 
04:35:01.709 --> 04:35:01.719 align:start position:0%
community members want to make sure our
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
kids know how our government works they
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
want to know when it's student graduates
 
04:35:08.349 --> 04:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
from high school that they have a basic
 
04:35:09.789 --> 04:35:09.799 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this country was
 
04:35:12.269 --> 04:35:12.279 align:start position:0%
founded how it's governed and what it
 
04:35:14.670 --> 04:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
means to be a citizen a basis of
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge is needed in order to engage
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
in analytical and critical thinking some
 
04:35:21.830 --> 04:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
public and private schools already use
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
this in New Hampshire so why not require
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
this for all
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
students um Civics today tends to focus
 
04:35:29.520 --> 04:35:30.750 align:start position:0%
students um Civics today tends to focus
on

04:35:30.750 --> 04:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
action but they should have a foundation
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
of knowledge know in order to draw upon
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
in order to take action there is nothing
 
04:35:42.910 --> 04:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
good about illiteracy especially when it
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
comes to this
 
04:35:46.830 --> 04:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
subject uh some of these classes focus
 
04:35:49.150 --> 04:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
on Project based learning they've moved
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
away from a real focus on academics and
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
so would this take some time out of the
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
classroom possibly but you're talking
 
04:36:00.750 --> 04:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
about literacy you're talking about
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
academic content so you're not taking a
 
04:36:05.590 --> 04:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
t t you know not taking time away from
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
learning information and knowledge
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
having that knowledge uh while public
 
04:36:12.269 --> 04:36:12.279 align:start position:0%
education is moving towards a more stem
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
in Workforce training Focus there are
 
04:36:16.709 --> 04:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
good reasons to support equality Liberal
 
04:36:20.109 --> 04:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
Liberal Arts education liberal comes
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
from the Latin word liar and it means
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
free a quality education in the liberal
 
04:36:27.750 --> 04:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
arts makes one free because it
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
transforms the students into good adults
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
and good citizens an education too
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
focused on employment may make a good
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
Banker but it won't make a good citizen
 
04:36:39.789 --> 04:36:39.799 align:start position:0%
and CS Lewis once wrote that if
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
education is beaten by training
 
04:36:44.990 --> 04:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
civilization dies the lesson of history
 
04:36:47.349 --> 04:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
is that Civilization is a rarity
 
04:36:50.670 --> 04:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
attained with difficulty and easily lost
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
it is the Liberal Liberal Arts not
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
vocational training that preserves
 
04:36:56.670 --> 04:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
Civilization by producing reasonable
 
04:36:59.349 --> 04:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
citizens we act most human when we are
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable in our thoughts and what we
 
04:37:04.590 --> 04:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
do the liberal arts is a discipline in
 
04:37:07.470 --> 04:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
education of self-rule to fulfill our
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
vocation to preserve civilization and to
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
avoid the errors of the past when we
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
Elevate literacy in all core subjects
 
04:37:18.990 --> 04:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
that is good for the students it's good
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
for public schools and it's good for the
 
04:37:25.070 --> 04:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
community so for these reasons I ask you
 
04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
to vote aop pass on HB 320 and I just
 
04:37:31.230 --> 04:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
like to add that some of these are basic
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
facts basic information but if we moved
 
04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:36.039 align:start position:0%
away from teaching math facts would it
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
be a problem to come back to focus on Ma
 
04:37:41.189 --> 04:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
math facts I think we can all see the
 
04:37:44.029 --> 04:37:44.039 align:start position:0%
benefit when uh when we go back to
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
teaching math facts as especially as a
 
04:37:49.869 --> 04:37:49.879 align:start position:0%
math tutor myself um and finally if you
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
want to give the test to the Reps I'm
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
all for that too so thank you for
 
04:38:00.070 --> 04:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
listening thank you very much um are
 
04:38:03.310 --> 04:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
there let's see I think the next person
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
to speak was Carl lad from the school
 
04:38:05.879 --> 04:38:16.189 align:start position:0%
to speak was Carl lad from the school
administrators

04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:19.390 --> 04:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
Association good afternoon Carl good
 
04:38:21.429 --> 04:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman thank you for um
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
taking my uh testimony um and um I would
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
like to thank uh representative Moffett
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
for his excellent uh instruction when I
 
04:38:33.789 --> 04:38:33.799 align:start position:0%
was in his ninth grade New Hampshire
 
04:38:36.990 --> 04:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
history class uh because uh because of
 
04:38:40.349 --> 04:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
him uh I certainly do understand uh how
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
government works um and uh he was a
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
great teacher um having said that um
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
with all due respect uh to
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett I'm not really
 
04:38:54.750 --> 04:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
sure that this is uh a necessary
 
04:38:59.789 --> 04:38:59.799 align:start position:0%
addition uh to statute um the the the
 
04:39:02.189 --> 04:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you is focused on
 
04:39:05.709 --> 04:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
Article 2 of RSA 189
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
91 but I think that you need to focus on
 
04:39:12.189 --> 04:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
article one of RSA
 
04:39:15.429 --> 04:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
189 which states specifically that all
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
public and private schools in the state
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
shall be given regular courses of
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
instruction in the history government
 
04:39:23.390 --> 04:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
and constitutions of the United States
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire including the
 
04:39:28.029 --> 04:39:28.039 align:start position:0%
organization and operation of New
 
04:39:30.109 --> 04:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal County and state
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
governments it goes on to say that a
 
04:39:35.230 --> 04:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
school district shall develop an offer
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
the United States and New Hampshire
 
04:39:38.670 --> 04:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
government Civics course and at a
 
04:39:40.990 --> 04:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
minimum the course shall include
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities and responsibilities for
 
04:39:46.030 --> 04:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
civic instruction and involvement skills
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
to effectively participate in civic
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
affairs the US Constitution the New
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution the structure and
 
04:39:55.230 --> 04:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
functions of the three branches of
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
government the role opportunities and
 
04:40:00.190 --> 04:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of a citizen to engage
 
04:40:02.190 --> 04:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
in Civic
 
04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
activity um last year there was also Al
 
04:40:07.948 --> 04:40:07.958 align:start position:0%
an addition made to article one stating
 
04:40:10.150 --> 04:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
how intolerance bigotry anti-Semitism
 
04:40:12.190 --> 04:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
and National ethnic racial or religious
 
04:40:14.550 --> 04:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
hatred and discrimination have evolved
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the past such as the Holocaust and
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
how to prevent the evolution of such
 
04:40:23.470 --> 04:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
practices so I I would say that um what
 
04:40:26.350 --> 04:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative Moffett is trying to
 
04:40:30.030 --> 04:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
get at a basic knowledge uh is already
 
04:40:32.110 --> 04:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
built into the
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
competencies uh identified in statute
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
for civics
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
classes um and as a former social
 
04:40:42.670 --> 04:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
studies teacher and a history teacher
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
for eth graders uh I certainly can
 
04:40:49.390 --> 04:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
empathize with folks uh not necessarily
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh understanding how uh government works
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
and what the three branches of
 
04:40:54.718 --> 04:40:56.350 align:start position:0%
and what the three branches of
government

04:40:56.350 --> 04:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:41:00.628 --> 04:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
are um I'm not convinced however that
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
being able to identify uh that the miss
 
04:41:06.708 --> 04:41:06.718 align:start position:0%
Missippi is one of the longest rivers in
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
the United States or that the Pacific
 
04:41:11.070 --> 04:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
Ocean is on the west coast is really
 
04:41:12.990 --> 04:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
going to get at what representative
 
04:41:15.868 --> 04:41:15.878 align:start position:0%
Moffet is talking about which is Civic
 
04:41:18.910 --> 04:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
involvement Civic understanding uh and
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement um I do believe that
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
the competencies that have been
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
identified already in statute do that
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
and that local school districts are
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
already using uh parts of that
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
naturalization exam
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
as part of their instruction and built
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
into their competencies um I would just
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
ask has either representative Moffett or
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
any of the um the folks on the committee
 
04:41:51.190 --> 04:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
have you seen any of the locally adopted
 
04:41:53.948 --> 04:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
uh Civics competencies or the Civics
 
04:41:56.350 --> 04:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
assessments my sense is that they go
 
04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
into not only what is outlined in the
 
04:42:04.708 --> 04:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
naturalization test but goes beyond that
 
04:42:07.788 --> 04:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
to talk about how do you participate in
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
your local state and federal governments
 
04:42:14.750 --> 04:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
because that's expressly laid out in
 
04:42:17.310 --> 04:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
article one of RSA
 
04:42:20.310 --> 04:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
189 um so I just think that this adds
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
one more thing uh to the plate of
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
Educators um that is
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I I think it's a good
 
04:42:33.868 --> 04:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
thing to be incorporated in some way but
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that it's necessary as
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh an ultimate assessment or even one of
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
the ultimate assessments for a high
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
school uh
 
04:42:48.510 --> 04:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
competency uh or a Civics course um and
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
I should just point out too um that
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
um my my fear is that this type of focus
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
limits what students will be concent
 
04:43:07.470 --> 04:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
trting on anybody who has taught in the
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
classroom knows that if if you are
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
saying that this is going to be the test
 
04:43:15.190 --> 04:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
by which you're measured then that's
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
what students focus on they focus on the
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
answers to that test how many folks have
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
passed the driver's test when they were
 
04:43:27.948 --> 04:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
16 and then blly go out and break every
 
04:43:30.670 --> 04:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
rule that they just learned about when
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
they're driving their car uh so I I
 
04:43:34.990 --> 04:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
04:43:36.670 --> 04:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
having the knowledge and then being able
 
04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
to implement it are two different things
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
um and I think that we do have a good
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
structure in place uh to provide the
 
04:43:46.350 --> 04:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
types of things that representative
 
04:43:49.230 --> 04:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
Moffet is looking for without adding
 
04:43:51.430 --> 04:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
something additional with that I'll end
 
04:43:53.550 --> 04:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
you very much Dr Lad are there any
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions for the school
 
04:44:01.510 --> 04:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
administrators uh yes represent Hopson
 
04:44:03.470 --> 04:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
04:44:05.230 --> 04:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
again um
 
04:44:08.948 --> 04:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
Mr lad um do you answer a question are
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
you confident that all schools are
 
04:44:14.110 --> 04:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
imparting and succeeding in imparting
 
04:44:17.350 --> 04:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
the basic Civic
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentals yes the the Assumption by
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
all of us has to be that school
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
districts are following the law uh that
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
they are developing curriculum that we
 
04:44:32.230 --> 04:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
have quality teachers and administrators
 
04:44:36.270 --> 04:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
overseeing that um do certain districts
 
04:44:40.230 --> 04:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
have more resources and uh ability to
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
provide above and beyond yes uh but
 
04:44:42.958 --> 04:44:44.230 align:start position:0%
provide above and beyond yes uh but
certainly

04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:44:46.470 --> 04:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
everyone every superintendent that I
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
know of uh and every building principal
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
and every High School Civics teacher and
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh Middle School uh Civics teacher uh
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
understands this law and is working
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard to implement it and to
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that students are engaged and
 
04:45:05.190 --> 04:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
do understand
 
04:45:09.550 --> 04:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
um so I my answer is is yes they are
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
they all being able to provide it at the
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
same level no because um in one school
 
04:45:17.708 --> 04:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
district you may have a college
 
04:45:19.750 --> 04:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
professor uh who's teaching a high
 
04:45:23.070 --> 04:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
school college or a high school Civics
 
04:45:26.030 --> 04:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
course because they're retired and have
 
04:45:28.030 --> 04:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
a doctorate in history and somewhere
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
else you may have somebody who doesn't
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
have that background it but the the
 
04:45:35.110 --> 04:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
content is still being being covered in
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
way will you take a followup question to
 
04:45:44.310 --> 04:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
that followup sir hson I I just wanted
 
04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
to uh point out an experience that I
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
know was happening in our school
 
04:45:51.868 --> 04:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
district and I thought it was it was
 
04:45:54.430 --> 04:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
amazing uh and I wish I had had the
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do this when I was in
 
04:46:00.990 --> 04:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
school our students were able to watch
 
04:46:01.000 --> 04:46:01.990 align:start position:0%
school our students were able to watch
uh

04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
immigrant um students
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
come in and take the citizenship
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
citizenship test in a ceremony and I
 
04:46:12.510 --> 04:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
asked if our students knew the
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
citizenship test and what was on the
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
test and if they could pass it and uh I
 
04:46:19.470 --> 04:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
was told that they're not given that
 
04:46:22.510 --> 04:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
test so um I just I thought that that
 
04:46:25.990 --> 04:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
was a disadvantage for them that they're
 
04:46:29.628 --> 04:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
watching people take become citizens in
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
our country and and it it's an honor are
 
04:46:35.230 --> 04:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
you going to pop question
 
04:46:38.350 --> 04:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
agree uh yes I I do agree that it's an
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
honor um and I do know that um several
 
04:46:49.948 --> 04:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
um school districts where there are uh
 
04:46:52.110 --> 04:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
naturalization um ceremonies that are
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
conducted within the schools um the the
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
teachers who are in involved with that
 
04:47:00.270 --> 04:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
certainly do have their students take
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
those exams and and are aware of them
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
and what they look like and what
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh prospective citizens have to do in
 
04:47:11.788 --> 04:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
order to become a citizen um but I don't
 
04:47:14.548 --> 04:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
think those those tests aren't uh then
 
04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
recorded um and put on uh a transcript
 
04:47:21.230 --> 04:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're provided to the to those
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
particular students and I'm not saying
 
04:47:26.350 --> 04:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
that everyone gets the same experience
 
04:47:29.788 --> 04:47:29.798 align:start position:0%
uh but and not everyone even if this
 
04:47:32.788 --> 04:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
gets passed um will get the same
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
experience uh that your children were
 
04:47:37.750 --> 04:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to get um because they
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
may not have a naturalization Center uh
 
04:47:44.310 --> 04:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's either in location to their
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
school or um actually some are located
 
04:47:48.910 --> 04:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:47:52.070 --> 04:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
schools thank you very much Dr lad uh
 
04:47:54.030 --> 04:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for the
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
school boards Association not seeing any
 
04:48:00.750 --> 04:48:00.760 align:start position:0%

kicked me out again as it did yesterday
 
04:48:28.990 --> 04:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
um I am here um my name is Megan Tuttle
 
04:48:30.670 --> 04:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
but I am here testifying as an
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
individual today not as the president of
 
04:48:34.150 --> 04:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
Nea New Hampshire I just want want to
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
make that clear um I taught social
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
studies for 18 years in 8th grade and I
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
just came out of the classroom a few
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
years ago um and while I do like the
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill because I do agree
 
04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
with everything that's been said um
 
04:48:52.548 --> 04:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
especially with um Dr Lad and and
 
04:48:54.788 --> 04:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
everybody else who spoken the only
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
concern or one of the concerns I have um
 
04:48:59.948 --> 04:48:59.958 align:start position:0%
is that it's a little vague and it's not
 
04:49:02.030 --> 04:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
really clear on when this would be you
 
04:49:03.510 --> 04:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
know administered the test when it would
 
04:49:04.948 --> 04:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
be given there's a lot of talk about it
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
being given in eth grade and that it
 
04:49:07.990 --> 04:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take time out from the
 
04:49:09.390 --> 04:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
classroom and I can speak as an
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
experienced educator of social studies
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
of 8th grade for 18 years that you know
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
time is already precious in the
 
04:49:17.270 --> 04:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
classroom I was teaching about
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
Washington DC one day a week because we
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
go visit our nation's capital and on a
 
04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
field trip and that was important the
 
04:49:24.430 --> 04:49:24.440 align:start position:0%
kids knew what they were going to see um
 
04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
I was teaching from the 1800s up through
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
the path up through after reconstruction
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
so that took you know a few days I also
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
took one day a week to talk about um
 
04:49:35.788 --> 04:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
economics and teach about that because
 
04:49:37.150 --> 04:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
that's not something that's typically
 
04:49:40.110 --> 04:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
taught as much so my kids had to get
 
04:49:41.590 --> 04:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
jobs as if they were high schoolers they
 
04:49:44.270 --> 04:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
had to learn to um you know balance a
 
04:49:45.868 --> 04:49:45.878 align:start position:0%
checkbook they had to have a job they
 
04:49:47.548 --> 04:49:47.558 align:start position:0%
had to put in their hours every week and
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
they had cards that happened and they
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
had to be a um you know homeowner so we
 
04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
did all that it does take time into the
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum to do something like this if
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
it is looking for eth grade um I did
 
04:50:02.948 --> 04:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
give this immigration test as a test
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
before they actually could come into my
 
04:50:06.510 --> 04:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
classroom as eighth graders um we gave
 
04:50:08.070 --> 04:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
it as kind of the first day of school
 
04:50:09.708 --> 04:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
for me okay here's the naturalization
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
test that people get to become um
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
naturalized citizens of the United
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
States how would you do on it
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
and very often they didn't do too well
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
but then I gave it at the end of the
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
year as well and you know they did
 
04:50:22.990 --> 04:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
acquire the knowledge and I would say
 
04:50:25.270 --> 04:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
over 18 years of teaching most of them
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
did learn a lot more throughout the year
 
04:50:29.150 --> 04:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
without a focus on just learning the
 
04:50:32.230 --> 04:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
facts um that being said I do support
 
04:50:33.868 --> 04:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
the concept I just think this bill is a
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
little vague in it I do think that we
 
04:50:38.590 --> 04:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
need to have much more um Civics taught
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the terms of what it is to become a
 
04:50:42.470 --> 04:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
citizen and how can you be a productive
 
04:50:44.990 --> 04:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
citizen in society um you know we do
 
04:50:46.548 --> 04:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
need to know the history I think a lot
 
04:50:49.310 --> 04:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
of problems have cropped up in the past
 
04:50:51.310 --> 04:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
few years past 10 years because there's
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
been so much focus on Reading Writing
 
04:50:55.390 --> 04:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
math the stem activities Etc the social
 
04:50:57.190 --> 04:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
studies has been put aside and it hasn't
 
04:50:58.750 --> 04:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
been as much of a focus as it should
 
04:51:01.270 --> 04:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
have been over the years um
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to put that out there
 
04:51:06.030 --> 04:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
um not as president of n New Hampshire
 
04:51:07.548 --> 04:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not speaking for the members I'm
 
04:51:10.030 --> 04:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
speaking as myself an individual um an
 
04:51:12.110 --> 04:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
educator and a mom of three boys who I
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
still have to explain things to daily um
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
and one's in eighth grade right now so
 
04:51:18.390 --> 04:51:18.400 align:start position:0%

often diverge from what was once normal
 
04:55:14.830 --> 04:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
in regard to higher education there is
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
no consensus about how a college campus
 
04:55:20.830 --> 04:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
life will occur or uniformally or or

04:58:00.910 --> 04:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
brought forward by the university system
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh they're they're looking to have this
 
04:58:05.270 --> 04:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
Shield hopefully they won't have to be
 
04:58:07.750 --> 04:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
use it but it is a protection for the
 
04:58:10.830 --> 04:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
University all the staff within it and
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
the businesses as well and the state of
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you very much for
 
04:58:19.708 --> 04:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify on this
 
04:58:22.350 --> 04:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr
 
04:58:30.150 --> 04:58:30.160 align:start position:0%

04:58:36.868 --> 04:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:38.590 --> 04:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question represent lad why
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
just the higher
 
04:58:45.270 --> 04:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
education why wouldn't we have public
 
04:58:47.390 --> 04:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
schools that would also be included in
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
this particular uh piece of uh proposal
 
04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
because they've got the same potential
 
04:58:55.590 --> 04:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
liability as a higher education
 
04:58:58.948 --> 04:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:02.190 --> 04:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
they I'm I'm not really a represent I'm
 
04:59:04.470 --> 04:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
not an attorney but uh this was written
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
by the university system and opened up
 
04:59:06.400 --> 04:59:07.190 align:start position:0%
by the university system and opened up
the

04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
businesses uh because it mimics
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that was proposed on the
 
04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
Congressional level in Washington DC uh
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
and it's similar to uh the many business
 
04:59:20.030 --> 04:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
and industry associations throughout the
 
04:59:22.590 --> 04:59:22.600 align:start position:0%
country in terms of dealing with k
 
04:59:25.310 --> 04:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
through2 for example we're dealing with
 
04:59:28.390 --> 04:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
a situation there where you also dealing
 
04:59:29.948 --> 04:59:29.958 align:start position:0%
with minors you're not dealing with
 
04:59:32.548 --> 04:59:32.558 align:start position:0%
adults as you would be on the other two
 
04:59:32.558 --> 04:59:34.628 align:start position:0%
adults as you would be on the other two
fronts

04:59:34.628 --> 04:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
fronts
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
so would would you be opposed to would
 
04:59:39.270 --> 04:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
you be opposed to putting public schools
 
04:59:42.750 --> 04:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
in there I I'm I'm not opposed to trying
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
to get a liability Shield like this for
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
any group that there is open to uh it
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
could possibly happen on on the K
 
04:59:56.310 --> 04:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
through2 level as well there's a lot of
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
act activity occurring where there's
 
05:00:01.310 --> 05:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
some folks very disgruntled about their
 
05:00:03.310 --> 05:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
students not going to school every day
 
05:00:06.390 --> 05:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
of the week being home three days a week
 
05:00:08.548 --> 05:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
uh and on the various it's scheduling is
 
05:00:10.430 --> 05:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
like at the colleges it's different for
 
05:00:14.548 --> 05:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
every place you go than thank
 
05:00:18.270 --> 05:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:27.270 --> 05:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee sorry thank you Mr chair um I
 
05:00:28.470 --> 05:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
not sure if there'll be a lawyer
 
05:00:30.750 --> 05:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
speaking on this later I don't know if I
 
05:00:32.910 --> 05:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
can ask a question there but I guess uh
 
05:00:35.788 --> 05:00:35.798 align:start position:0%
chairman lad or Mr representative lad
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
since I guess you're not in that seat
 
05:00:40.190 --> 05:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
right now um the language on um having
 
05:00:43.310 --> 05:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
to fall rely on applicable government
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
standards and guidance um while it is
 
05:00:48.150 --> 05:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
just limited to to covid here that seems
 
05:00:50.350 --> 05:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
like a really large barn door that could
 
05:00:52.190 --> 05:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
be opened up I don't know if some
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
language that would cover the idea that
 
05:00:56.548 --> 05:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
if anybody were to willfully deceive
 
05:00:58.548 --> 05:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
anybody about their M risk mitigation
 
05:01:01.910 --> 05:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
efforts might be um a solution that
 
05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
would protect them because as long as
 
05:01:06.150 --> 05:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
they're willing to discuss whatever
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation they're taking to approach Co
 
05:01:09.310 --> 05:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
which may be above and beyond the
 
05:01:13.030 --> 05:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines it'll prevent us from uh
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
basically being an enforcement arm of uh
 
05:01:18.190 --> 05:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
of departments as opposed to having
 
05:01:21.150 --> 05:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
those laws come from the legislature yes
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
when we introduce this
 
05:01:27.910 --> 05:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
ran um it's it's basically a close to a
 
05:01:29.670 --> 05:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
boiler plate from many places throughout
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
the country you could go to Montana and
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
probably find similar legislation
 
05:01:35.150 --> 05:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
as a result of the University Systems
 
05:01:37.948 --> 05:01:37.958 align:start position:0%
and business uh uh working together
 
05:01:39.990 --> 05:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
trying to and and on the Congressional
 
05:01:43.390 --> 05:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
level as well this bill would have to go
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
before a second
 
05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
committee most likely Judiciary right
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
and where where we have legal staff that
 
05:01:55.350 --> 05:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
would provide the type of answers to
 
05:01:57.548 --> 05:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
medicate some of the issues that that
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
will probably come up as a result of
 
05:02:02.350 --> 05:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
this I know that there probably will be
 
05:02:05.470 --> 05:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh very ious uh Judiciary groups may be
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
testifying today I haven't seen the list
 
05:02:09.430 --> 05:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
I talked to one the other night on the
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
horn I think the intent is there the
 
05:02:15.190 --> 05:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
intent is a good intent however there
 
05:02:17.628 --> 05:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
probably going to be a lot of legal
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
ramifications and with this being a very
 
05:02:22.788 --> 05:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
high priority I think it was Priority
 
05:02:25.788 --> 05:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
One when I went to the Bia meetings this
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
this fall for that
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
organization um and I know the
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
university although they may not have
 
05:02:34.470 --> 05:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
had any issues like this and business
 
05:02:37.350 --> 05:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
may be the same it's that one issue that
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
may come up so uh it's something that
 
05:02:42.510 --> 05:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
should be worked on should probably go
 
05:02:45.628 --> 05:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
to Judiciary we're talking Co here we
 
05:02:46.868 --> 05:02:46.878 align:start position:0%
could be talking about some other
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
emergency just as well and how would
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
this apply to that so there I think this
 
05:02:55.868 --> 05:02:55.878 align:start position:0%
is just a start and I guess it's trying
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be a little proactive rather than
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
reactive later on thank you very much
 
05:03:01.628 --> 05:03:01.638 align:start position:0%
for the question thank you very much
 
05:03:06.390 --> 05:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions yes Mr
 
05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
representative W thank you Mr chairman
 
05:03:14.270 --> 05:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
um representative L just f up uh uh on
 
05:03:16.590 --> 05:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
the liability for
 
05:03:19.628 --> 05:03:19.638 align:start position:0%
institutions uh just as a and I think
 
05:03:20.948 --> 05:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
you may have just answered saying that
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
you don't know the answer uh because you
 
05:03:26.190 --> 05:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
go to different Judiciary committees but
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh for the college setting if uh one of
 
05:03:33.270 --> 05:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
our colleges uh is having a
 
05:03:34.590 --> 05:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting or an
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
organizational a a rally if you will uh
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
and students are participating in the
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
rally and they are
 
05:03:47.310 --> 05:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
unmasked and there's a massive number of
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
people beyond the governor's order
 
05:03:53.628 --> 05:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
they're unmasked and someone gets covid
 
05:03:56.548 --> 05:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
from the unmasked group and then passes
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
away and the university did not stop the
 
05:04:04.390 --> 05:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
stop the the uh rally uh or could be a
 
05:04:06.350 --> 05:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
local Bender downtown next to University
 
05:04:09.350 --> 05:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
if they did not stop the rally uh or
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
enforce the masking regulation would
 
05:04:14.548 --> 05:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
that would this then allow them to be
 
05:04:17.708 --> 05:04:17.718 align:start position:0%
exempt the the issues you raised
 
05:04:21.270 --> 05:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative are perhaps not through
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
the degree but sort of similar to
 
05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
remember the fraternity incident at the
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
beginning of Co here at UNH that was in
 
05:04:31.390 --> 05:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
the paper 40 plus kids got together and
 
05:04:34.350 --> 05:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
of the 40 plus kids we had a high number
 
05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
of kids that came down with Co we've
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
been down there for um our session days
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
several times to the UNH campus and I
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank them very much for the opportunity
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
of being there however there are times
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
when I noticed that there were people
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
that were uh walking around without mask
 
05:04:55.708 --> 05:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
and that kids were quick to identify and
 
05:04:57.628 --> 05:04:57.638 align:start position:0%
try to say why aren't you wearing your
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
mask there are situations where um if
 
05:05:02.160 --> 05:05:03.430 align:start position:0%
mask there are situations where um if
the

05:05:03.430 --> 05:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:05:07.310 --> 05:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
University Systems knly allowing this to
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
occur and allowing and sanctioning that
 
05:05:13.470 --> 05:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
party at the fraternity house knowing
 
05:05:16.030 --> 05:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
all the circumstances and the issues
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
associated with covid are they going to
 
05:05:20.230 --> 05:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
be responsible I think I'm getting into
 
05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
the turf of a lawyer and I don't want to
 
05:05:25.708 --> 05:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
go there but Common Sense would say that
 
05:05:28.350 --> 05:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
the university has responsibility to the
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
all the students they're paying tuition
 
05:05:33.390 --> 05:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
to provide a safe environment and I know
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
that the university system theh is doing
 
05:05:39.230 --> 05:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
that um so uh I think we're talking
 
05:05:41.788 --> 05:05:41.798 align:start position:0%
about where's that line that's where I
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
would say that it needs really some
 
05:05:47.310 --> 05:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee work um this is I'm
 
05:05:49.150 --> 05:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
looking at from the policy perspective
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
saying yes it's good intent perhaps we
 
05:05:53.948 --> 05:05:53.958 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking into this this area
 
05:05:53.958 --> 05:05:55.030 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking into this this area
of

05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:05:58.110 --> 05:05:58.120 align:start position:0%

05:07:22.830 --> 05:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester thank you Mr chair and the
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate the time to
 
05:07:27.548 --> 05:07:27.558 align:start position:0%
testify today um I'm testifying an
 
05:07:30.510 --> 05:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill uh as the
 
05:07:32.590 --> 05:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
chairperson said I am a representative I
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
represent Ward 2 in Manchester and I'm
 
05:07:38.990 --> 05:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
also a lawyer um a practicing attorney
 
05:07:41.470 --> 05:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
and part of my practice is representing
 
05:07:44.270 --> 05:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
folks injured due to negligence um I
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
also have
 
05:07:47.708 --> 05:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
experience uh considerable experience
 
05:07:50.230 --> 05:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
with certain immunity statutes which
 
05:07:53.310 --> 05:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
exist currently um such as this one
 
05:07:55.390 --> 05:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
particularly the the ski immunity
 
05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
statute so I'm somewhat qualified on
 
05:08:01.788 --> 05:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
this topic um I'm opposed to this bill
 
05:08:05.990 --> 05:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
for for a simple reason um regardless of
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
of what other other explanations are
 
05:08:10.830 --> 05:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
proferred the sole purpose and the sole
 
05:08:13.390 --> 05:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
effect of this bill is to allow
 
05:08:16.708 --> 05:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
negligent businesses and negligent
 
05:08:19.270 --> 05:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
colleges which negligently injure
 
05:08:22.390 --> 05:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
someone to get off scot-free that is
 
05:08:26.230 --> 05:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
100% the only effect of this bill um and
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
why is that because under current law a
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
college or business and I I I say both
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
because because I think the the chairman
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
really only mentored universities but
 
05:08:38.910 --> 05:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
this bill actually Cuts much broader
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
than that it also includes businesses
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
generally um Pro for-profit businesses
 
05:08:46.948 --> 05:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
under current law those entities are
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
only responsible they're only legally
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
liable if they're negligent you're not
 
05:08:53.868 --> 05:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
liable someone gets injured or covid on
 
05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
your property just you know just on your
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
property you're not liable if one of
 
05:09:01.708 --> 05:09:01.718 align:start position:0%
your employees gives covid to one of
 
05:09:04.390 --> 05:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
your customer customers um you're only
 
05:09:07.310 --> 05:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
liable if you are negligent and so what
 
05:09:10.830 --> 05:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
this statute or what this bill does is
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
to immunize negligent
 
05:09:13.520 --> 05:09:15.750 align:start position:0%
to immunize negligent
behavior

05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
05:09:19.230 --> 05:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple exceptions in here
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
um that that you know create exceptions
 
05:09:25.750 --> 05:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
to this immunity bar to negligence one
 
05:09:27.548 --> 05:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
and I'll go through a couple things here
 
05:09:29.628 --> 05:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill one is that it
 
05:09:31.270 --> 05:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
creates an exception for grossly
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
negligent conduct um in paragraph two or
 
05:09:38.548 --> 05:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
three here um however I'll I'll just
 
05:09:40.190 --> 05:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
point out that the way that it defines
 
05:09:42.190 --> 05:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
gross negligence is not in accord with
 
05:09:43.788 --> 05:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
the common law it's not in accord with
 
05:09:46.708 --> 05:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
the law um well in New Hampshire we
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
actually don't recognize degrees of
 
05:09:50.430 --> 05:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
negligence but the law generally
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um the definition of gross
 
05:09:55.628 --> 05:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
negligence here would require an injured
 
05:09:59.150 --> 05:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
person to prove that a the business or
 
05:10:03.030 --> 05:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
college knew the others were likely to
 
05:10:05.110 --> 05:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
catch the virus but acted anyway not
 
05:10:06.548 --> 05:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
that not just that they should have
 
05:10:09.110 --> 05:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
known um you have to actually under this
 
05:10:11.948 --> 05:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
bill prove that person's state of mind
 
05:10:13.868 --> 05:10:13.878 align:start position:0%
and that they consciously disregarded an
 
05:10:15.830 --> 05:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
extreme risk it's basically an
 
05:10:18.350 --> 05:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
impossible standard um and it's it's
 
05:10:21.070 --> 05:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
really just window dressing um it it
 
05:10:22.868 --> 05:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
really does not create any sort of
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
workable uh allowance for bringing a
 
05:10:28.708 --> 05:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
meritorious claim for personal injury if
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
there were any such claim and I think
 
05:10:33.310 --> 05:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
that's something we cannot Closs over at
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
all it's one of the first things that
 
05:10:37.830 --> 05:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
chairman lad said and he
 
05:10:41.708 --> 05:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
acknowledged there has been no covid
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
personal injury claim in New Hampshire
 
05:10:46.708 --> 05:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
period there's no evidence of any
 
05:10:48.430 --> 05:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in that regard or any other
 
05:10:51.390 --> 05:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
legal claim this is not a problem um
 
05:10:53.788 --> 05:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
we're almost a year into this thing
 
05:10:56.830 --> 05:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
we're getting better at managing it and
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
still even from the beginning of this
 
05:11:00.788 --> 05:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic there has not been a single
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
legal claim in New Hampshire relating to
 
05:11:05.628 --> 05:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
it that's pretty striking and and it
 
05:11:08.110 --> 05:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
kind of reveals to me how this is
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and how it really has a uh
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
an intent much broader than the innocent
 
05:11:17.070 --> 05:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
purpose that it it it's purported to be
 
05:11:19.030 --> 05:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
um the next thing that the bill does is
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
it raises the standard of proof so not
 
05:11:24.270 --> 05:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
only can you not recover even if the
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
business or college is negligent even if
 
05:11:29.788 --> 05:11:29.798 align:start position:0%
you try to prove gross negligence or or
 
05:11:31.948 --> 05:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
wanting contact or whatever the other
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
ceptions are it creates a standard of
 
05:11:37.110 --> 05:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
proof Which is higher than what's normal
 
05:11:39.430 --> 05:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
for civil trials in New Hampshire and
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the country which is
 
05:11:43.070 --> 05:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
the preponderance of the evidence
 
05:11:45.230 --> 05:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
standard um the standard that's been in
 
05:11:48.070 --> 05:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
place for centuries in this country it
 
05:11:50.310 --> 05:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
changes that standard to clear and
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
convincing which is a higher burden of
 
05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
proof a very difficult burden of proof
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate um so even again even if
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
you could show gross negligence under
 
05:12:03.190 --> 05:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
nor normal circumstances which I think
 
05:12:05.590 --> 05:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
would be virtually impossible under the
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
standard you still don't Prevail you
 
05:12:09.430 --> 05:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
still have to meet this higher even
 
05:12:12.628 --> 05:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
higher more rigorous standard um and
 
05:12:14.548 --> 05:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
finally if that weren't enough the bill
 
05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
shortens the standard of the statute of
 
05:12:18.830 --> 05:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
limitations which is three years in New
 
05:12:21.868 --> 05:12:21.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to one year um so not only do
 
05:12:24.548 --> 05:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
you have this nearly impossible standard
 
05:12:26.548 --> 05:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
to me of gross negligence not only do
 
05:12:28.990 --> 05:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
you have a higher burden of proof than
 
05:12:31.910 --> 05:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
every other civil litigant in the state
 
05:12:34.350 --> 05:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
you also have onethird of the time to
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
bring a claim even if you can meet all
 
05:12:41.150 --> 05:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
all of those uh standards so you know
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
this is simply speaking an completely
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary thing um it's there's no
 
05:12:50.350 --> 05:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
evidence that it that it is required to
 
05:12:50.360 --> 05:12:51.390 align:start position:0%
evidence that it that it is required to
protect

05:12:51.390 --> 05:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
protect
 
05:12:54.230 --> 05:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
businesses um you know the the chairman
 
05:12:56.830 --> 05:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it only takes one and I
 
05:12:59.948 --> 05:12:59.958 align:start position:0%
would ask it only takes one until what
 
05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the world is not going to end if
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
there's a claim
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
um if there is a claim I think we can
 
05:13:06.750 --> 05:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
assume at this point that it has some
 
05:13:08.788 --> 05:13:08.798 align:start position:0%
Merit because we've gone almost a year
 
05:13:10.190 --> 05:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
and there hasn't been any rash of
 
05:13:10.200 --> 05:13:11.350 align:start position:0%
and there hasn't been any rash of
frivolous

05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
05:13:14.350 --> 05:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um the entire purpose of the
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
Judiciary System and our justice system
 
05:13:18.430 --> 05:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
is to allow folks to bring their claims
 
05:13:20.470 --> 05:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
into court and have a jury of their
 
05:13:23.390 --> 05:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
peers decide whether that claim is valid
 
05:13:24.788 --> 05:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
you know that system has worked for
 
05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years what our framers
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
intended our founding fathers and what
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
this bill does is essentially have the
 
05:13:34.548 --> 05:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
legislature dictate who gets access to
 
05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
the courthouse it's an activist it's a
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
paternalistic it's an unnecessary
 
05:13:42.750 --> 05:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
measure um and really all it does is is
 
05:13:45.990 --> 05:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
protect negligent conduct um I'll I'll
 
05:13:49.150 --> 05:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
also add just as a side um and aside
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
that we're as one of the representatives
 
05:13:53.708 --> 05:13:53.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're we're really talking
 
05:13:56.030 --> 05:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
about insurance companies here um it's
 
05:13:57.470 --> 05:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies spending the money
 
05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
to if there is such a claim to defend it
 
05:14:03.030 --> 05:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
to pay a settlement or to pay a verdict
 
05:14:05.548 --> 05:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
um and finally it's not going to
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
prevent uh cases from being filed in the
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
first place that's something I've heard
 
05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
some proponents say yeah they couldn't
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
prove it under current law but we still
 
05:14:17.788 --> 05:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
have to pay to defend it um that's going
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
to be the case anyway even with this
 
05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill passed even if there were a
 
05:14:24.510 --> 05:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
unmeritorious claim Advanced there's
 
05:14:27.070 --> 05:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
exceptions under the statute and they
 
05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
could a lawyer or a plantiff could still
 
05:14:31.270 --> 05:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
Advance a lawsuit under those exceptions
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
so you're going to defend it either way
 
05:14:35.830 --> 05:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is immunize negligent
 
05:14:37.868 --> 05:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
conduct so I'm happy to take any
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
questions um but that's why I oppose
 
05:14:40.718 --> 05:14:42.110 align:start position:0%
questions um but that's why I oppose
this

05:14:42.110 --> 05:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:14:45.150 --> 05:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative first
 
05:14:47.788 --> 05:14:47.798 align:start position:0%
question is from representative Miler uh
 
05:14:50.110 --> 05:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this forward
 
05:14:55.788 --> 05:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
is there a this may be an impossible
 
05:14:58.830 --> 05:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
answer but is there a simple definition
 
05:14:58.840 --> 05:15:00.590 align:start position:0%
answer but is there a simple definition
of

05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:15:00.600 --> 05:15:02.150 align:start position:0%
of
negligence

05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
negligence
 
05:15:04.150 --> 05:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes it's the fail failure to use
 
05:15:06.270 --> 05:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable care under all the
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
circumstances and it's purposefully a
 
05:15:08.638 --> 05:15:09.670 align:start position:0%
circumstances and it's purposefully a
flexible

05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
definition um what is a reasonable care
 
05:15:14.830 --> 05:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances depends
 
05:15:16.830 --> 05:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
obviously on the circumstances so if
 
05:15:18.270 --> 05:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
you're driving a car and you fail to
 
05:15:19.670 --> 05:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
stop at a stop
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
light we Define that as a failure to use
 
05:15:26.590 --> 05:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable care um in this situation if
 
05:15:29.750 --> 05:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
you are a business owner and you're a
 
05:15:31.628 --> 05:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
you know you're aware of the risk of
 
05:15:33.628 --> 05:15:33.638 align:start position:0%
covid in the community and the the rates
 
05:15:36.670 --> 05:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
are rising and you failed to take any
 
05:15:39.990 --> 05:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
measures to you know mitigate that risk
 
05:15:44.070 --> 05:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
or prevent customers from being exposed
 
05:15:46.868 --> 05:15:46.878 align:start position:0%
to that risk then a jury would have to
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
decide is it reasonable for that jury
 
05:15:52.830 --> 05:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
for that business to act the way it did
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I think in many cases a jury is
 
05:15:58.350 --> 05:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
going to understand that this is a very
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
difficult Dynamic situation businesses
 
05:16:01.280 --> 05:16:02.310 align:start position:0%
difficult Dynamic situation businesses
can't

05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
can't
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
guarantee a customer's safety or
 
05:16:06.548 --> 05:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
colleges can't guarantee a student
 
05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
safety and a jury I think in many cases
 
05:16:13.070 --> 05:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
would conclude yes despite fact that
 
05:16:14.948 --> 05:16:14.958 align:start position:0%
someone got injured due to covid on the
 
05:16:17.110 --> 05:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
property or whatever despite the fact
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
they may have been able to do more they
 
05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
acted reasonably and therefore there's
 
05:16:23.548 --> 05:16:23.558 align:start position:0%
no negligence and therefore there's a
 
05:16:26.670 --> 05:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
verdict for the defense um so that's why
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
the existing common law and the existing
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
state of the law now is flexible enough
 
05:16:33.430 --> 05:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
to handle a lot of the concerns brought
 
05:16:36.270 --> 05:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
by proponents of this bill the standard
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
adapts and it has adapted for hundreds
 
05:16:38.080 --> 05:16:38.948 align:start position:0%
adapts and it has adapted for hundreds
of

05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
years thank you very
 
05:16:46.750 --> 05:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you um I see representative
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
Muffet thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
represent for taking my question uh in
 
05:16:54.510 --> 05:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
terms of torts or personal injuries
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
those cases happen all the time and it's
 
05:16:59.590 --> 05:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
often very easy to prove negligence or
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
gr's negligence or who's in fall
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
but with co uh even if a a university
 
05:17:09.750 --> 05:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
has bad practices or Del is delinquent
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
in in some
 
05:17:13.548 --> 05:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
practices isn't it true that there is
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely no way to prove that anyone
 
05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
ever got a virus here or there it may be
 
05:17:22.510 --> 05:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
likely but isn't it impossible to prove
 
05:17:24.788 --> 05:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
that anyone got a virus
 
05:17:26.788 --> 05:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
anywhere I think that's absolutely
 
05:17:28.350 --> 05:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
correct representative thank you for
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
that question and that illustrates very
 
05:17:34.548 --> 05:17:34.558 align:start position:0%
well why this is unnecessary because
 
05:17:37.510 --> 05:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
under the current law a plaintiff would
 
05:17:40.548 --> 05:17:40.558 align:start position:0%
need to prove not only that a business
 
05:17:42.788 --> 05:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
was negligent or a college was negligent
 
05:17:46.430 --> 05:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
in some way but also that the person who
 
05:17:49.470 --> 05:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
contracted the virus contracted it more
 
05:17:53.430 --> 05:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
likely than not from that business or
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
college um so under current law I would
 
05:17:59.310 --> 05:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
say that it's difficult if not
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
impossible for a plaintiff to prove that
 
05:18:04.750 --> 05:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
they contracted covid from a negligent
 
05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
actor um all this bill would do is if in
 
05:18:12.110 --> 05:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
a certain case it were
 
05:18:15.788 --> 05:18:15.798 align:start position:0%
provable that someone caught covid you
 
05:18:18.548 --> 05:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
know as a as a more likely than not
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable likelihood um from a
 
05:18:24.070 --> 05:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
particularly negligent
 
05:18:26.590 --> 05:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
actor that under this bill they still
 
05:18:30.548 --> 05:18:30.558 align:start position:0%
would not be able to bring a claim um I
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
can imagine some hypothetical situations
 
05:18:35.590 --> 05:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
where you could prove more likely than
 
05:18:39.590 --> 05:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
not that someone contracted covid from a
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
particular actor if someone literally
 
05:18:43.470 --> 05:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
did not leave their home except to go to
 
05:18:46.470 --> 05:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
a business for for one thing and caught
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
covid I think a jury could conclude more
 
05:18:50.590 --> 05:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
likely than not they caught it from that
 
05:18:53.110 --> 05:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
Source but as you say that's extremely
 
05:18:54.910 --> 05:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
unlikely people go out into the
 
05:18:56.270 --> 05:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
community they interact with other
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
people and I think in 99.9% of cases you
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
would not be able to prove that to a
 
05:19:05.868 --> 05:19:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary thank you yes represent oh
 
05:19:12.548 --> 05:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I do understand
 
05:19:14.350 --> 05:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
that in most cases you couldn't prove
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
the transmission but would this be a
 
05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
huge problem for nursing homes where
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
facility I'm not sure I understand your
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
question what do you mean by what would
 
05:19:28.110 --> 05:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
it be a huge problem well would this
 
05:19:30.788 --> 05:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
would this open up I guess you're
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
talking about about the challenge of
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
showing the transmission in any location
 
05:19:37.948 --> 05:19:37.958 align:start position:0%
but with this higher burden of proof a
 
05:19:39.548 --> 05:19:39.558 align:start position:0%
patient who's been in a nursing home
 
05:19:42.910 --> 05:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
since January 1st 2020 would have no
 
05:19:44.470 --> 05:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
other rout of transmission other than
 
05:19:47.590 --> 05:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
the nursing home correct and so so this
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
is that's one of the few P clear cases
 
05:19:51.190 --> 05:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
where you could prove
 
05:19:53.110 --> 05:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
transmission I think you're right
 
05:19:55.548 --> 05:19:55.558 align:start position:0%
arguably um I think a defense would
 
05:19:57.948 --> 05:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
still argue well they had you know they
 
05:19:59.708 --> 05:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
were interacting with vendors who
 
05:20:01.788 --> 05:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
weren't employees of the Nur ing home or
 
05:20:03.070 --> 05:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
they were interacting with other
 
05:20:05.390 --> 05:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
patients who interacted with vendors
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of um you know with an
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
a virus nature this one is or any um
 
05:20:15.430 --> 05:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
threat or risk such as this one you can
 
05:20:17.590 --> 05:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
always argue potentially that it came
 
05:20:19.470 --> 05:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
from other sources but you're right
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's one of the few situations where I
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
could conceivably see um a jury say yeah
 
05:20:27.868 --> 05:20:27.878 align:start position:0%
we can we can we have a reasonable
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
likelihood um that more likely than not
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
this is where the plaintiff contracted
 
05:20:36.110 --> 05:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
covid they were clearly negligent in
 
05:20:37.708 --> 05:20:37.718 align:start position:0%
some way and therefore they should be
 
05:20:42.510 --> 05:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
held responsible um under this bill even
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
if you could show that that nursing home
 
05:20:44.920 --> 05:20:46.910 align:start position:0%
if you could show that that nursing home
patient

05:20:46.910 --> 05:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
patient
 
05:20:49.788 --> 05:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
was uh did contract covid from the
 
05:20:52.030 --> 05:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
nursing home from the nursing home's
 
05:20:54.190 --> 05:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
negligence and that you know they died
 
05:20:56.230 --> 05:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
or were harmed as a result under this
 
05:20:57.830 --> 05:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill that person would have no recourse
 
05:20:59.350 --> 05:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
under the
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
law thank you very much thank you Mr
 
05:21:08.270 --> 05:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um I ask one question um what
 
05:21:10.270 --> 05:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
happens when a college allows students
 
05:21:14.350 --> 05:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
to walk around campus without masks if
 
05:21:17.070 --> 05:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
the college does in fact have a mask
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
policy but it doesn't enforce
 
05:21:25.470 --> 05:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
it sure so I think that goes back to the
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
centuries old standard of reasonableness
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
and negligence there isn't any require
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
enironment that a business or college
 
05:21:38.230 --> 05:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
take literally every measure possible to
 
05:21:40.750 --> 05:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
prevent a risk there's no requirement
 
05:21:44.868 --> 05:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
that um they make their campus perfectly
 
05:21:47.310 --> 05:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
safe as long as they're taking some sort
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
of reasonable precautions such as you
 
05:21:53.150 --> 05:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
know having an you know I think what the
 
05:21:54.670 --> 05:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
colleges are doing right now is
 
05:21:57.070 --> 05:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable frankly which is have a
 
05:22:00.990 --> 05:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
mandate you know have certain uh
 
05:22:03.070 --> 05:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement you know at at reasonable
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
areas and reasonable buildings you can't
 
05:22:06.868 --> 05:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
police every single student out on
 
05:22:08.708 --> 05:22:08.718 align:start position:0%
campus you can't police every single
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
person in their dorms and I think that a
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
jury would agree as long as they're
 
05:22:14.830 --> 05:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
taking good faith efforts they've acted
 
05:22:16.670 --> 05:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
reasonably and therefore there is no
 
05:22:18.350 --> 05:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
negligence so I don't think that there
 
05:22:21.628 --> 05:22:21.638 align:start position:0%
would be liability under current law for
 
05:22:24.430 --> 05:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
massless students walking
 
05:22:29.230 --> 05:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
around thank you um I see no further
 
05:22:31.270 --> 05:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative thank
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
you very much for being here this
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you very much next we

yourself where did you go there you are
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
right here good afternoon
 
05:22:52.750 --> 05:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
hi um hi I'm Carol Martin I'm the
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
associate general counsel for the
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
University system and um I appreciate
 
05:23:00.110 --> 05:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak on this bill um
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
we are grateful to the sponsors of this
 
05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
bill and representative lad for bringing
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
it forward to this committee um and for
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
considering the issues of liability
 
05:23:10.350 --> 05:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:23:12.670 --> 05:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 if the pandemic has taught us
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
anything and is that we cannot predict
 
05:23:16.670 --> 05:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
what tomorrow will bring and just based
 
05:23:18.628 --> 05:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
on the comments I've heard so far that
 
05:23:22.430 --> 05:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
includes um the the changes and
 
05:23:24.750 --> 05:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
regulations and expectations and what is
 
05:23:28.590 --> 05:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
considered reasonable during this time U
 
05:23:30.510 --> 05:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
from the onside the university system
 
05:23:32.310 --> 05:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
trans transitioned quickly to remote
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
learning to support our hosts and
 
05:23:36.470 --> 05:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
surrounding communities and to assist in
 
05:23:38.470 --> 05:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
the state's response to the
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic over the summer we developed
 
05:23:44.110 --> 05:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
and implemented plans for weekly testing
 
05:23:46.390 --> 05:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
and well-coordinated safety measures
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
which include mask mandates that allowed
 
05:23:51.788 --> 05:23:51.798 align:start position:0%
us to return over 20,000 students from
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
around the state and across the country
 
05:23:56.510 --> 05:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
to in-person learning on our campuses
 
05:23:59.230 --> 05:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
this past fall these efforts were
 
05:24:01.628 --> 05:24:01.638 align:start position:0%
necessary despite their expense to
 
05:24:03.470 --> 05:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that we had engaging learning
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
experiences and to protect our students
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff and to provide vital
 
05:24:10.750 --> 05:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
support to the local economies and the
 
05:24:12.750 --> 05:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
communities that host our
 
05:24:15.548 --> 05:24:15.558 align:start position:0%
institutions systemwide and systematic
 
05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
testing has helped to decrease Community
 
05:24:21.628 --> 05:24:21.638 align:start position:0%
spread by identifying asymptomatic cases
 
05:24:24.190 --> 05:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
that may have otherwise gone undetected
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
we are incredibly proud of our students
 
05:24:27.910 --> 05:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
and our staff and faculty who have
 
05:24:30.030 --> 05:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
embraced a culture of safety
 
05:24:33.030 --> 05:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
accountability and care for one another
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:38.910 --> 05:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
possible right now we're at the
 
05:24:41.670 --> 05:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
beginning of our spring semester at UNH
 
05:24:44.030 --> 05:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
in Plymouth State and we have um Keen
 
05:24:46.510 --> 05:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
State starting in a couple of weeks our
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
students and faculty are engaged in a
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
range of learning modalities while our
 
05:24:52.510 --> 05:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
Frontline campus employees including
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
Dining Services residential life student
 
05:24:57.948 --> 05:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
support staff are all working in person
 
05:25:00.990 --> 05:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
and on campus um diligently to ensure a
 
05:25:04.190 --> 05:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
safe engaging and productive
 
05:25:06.910 --> 05:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
semester we've worked hard to meet and
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
exceed federal and state
 
05:25:11.670 --> 05:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations and guidelines and again
 
05:25:14.070 --> 05:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
I would add that those change almost
 
05:25:16.470 --> 05:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
daily and certain certainly
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
frequently and we've been Guided by the
 
05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
best available research to to open and
 
05:25:25.070 --> 05:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
operate our campuses safely our testing
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
program has provided evidence for the
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
success of these efforts as rates of
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
infection on our campuses have remained
 
05:25:33.070 --> 05:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
well below the state
 
05:25:35.150 --> 05:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
average with that said the current
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
Public Health crisis continues to
 
05:25:39.070 --> 05:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
present us with new and untested
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances given the uncertainty as
 
05:25:43.150 --> 05:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
we welcome a conversation around
 
05:25:45.430 --> 05:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
liability protection in order to attempt
 
05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure that our institutions and our
 
05:25:50.430 --> 05:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff are protected and I'm
 
05:25:52.110 --> 05:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from

questions thank you any questions from

05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
you uh good afternoon uh thank you for
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak for the record my
 
05:26:19.868 --> 05:26:19.878 align:start position:0%
name is Rudy Ogden Deputy Commissioner
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Labor I just wanted
 
05:26:24.350 --> 05:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
to speak Bri uh briefly this bill does
 
05:26:27.548 --> 05:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
reference intersection with RSA 281a
 
05:26:29.548 --> 05:26:29.558 align:start position:0%
which is the workers comp law and the
 
05:26:31.470 --> 05:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and we have had
 
05:26:33.590 --> 05:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions uh surrounding workers
 
05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
compensation and its relation to covid
 
05:26:37.750 --> 05:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in the context of workplace
 
05:26:40.830 --> 05:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
injuries uh for employees uh just as a
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
brief background I would say and there
 
05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
is an attorney general's memo to this
 
05:26:46.708 --> 05:26:46.718 align:start position:0%
effect stating that employees in the
 
05:26:49.708 --> 05:26:49.718 align:start position:0%
context of uh working for their employer
 
05:26:51.510 --> 05:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
any injuries that they have resulting
 
05:26:54.070 --> 05:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
from such activity or actions they are
 
05:26:55.948 --> 05:26:55.958 align:start position:0%
limited to redress through workers
 
05:26:57.910 --> 05:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
compensation and what I mean by that is
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
if an employee is injured or in this
 
05:27:03.310 --> 05:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
case came down with covid at work and
 
05:27:05.310 --> 05:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
had certain after effects or impacts
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
from that condition uh they would not be
 
05:27:11.070 --> 05:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
able to sue their employer regardless of
 
05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
these standards such as negligence and
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
other things of that nature I just point
 
05:27:17.070 --> 05:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
that out to again stress the fact that
 
05:27:18.868 --> 05:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
an employee sole recours is through
 
05:27:20.830 --> 05:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
workers comp that's something that I
 
05:27:23.990 --> 05:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that all individuals have an
 
05:27:25.708 --> 05:27:25.718 align:start position:0%
understanding of uh so it's something
 
05:27:27.548 --> 05:27:27.558 align:start position:0%
that we try to make clear that for
 
05:27:29.708 --> 05:27:29.718 align:start position:0%
purposes of immunity or shielding
 
05:27:31.548 --> 05:27:31.558 align:start position:0%
relative to employees working in the
 
05:27:34.150 --> 05:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
workplace uh their sole recourse is
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
through workers compensation uh
 
05:27:39.628 --> 05:27:39.638 align:start position:0%
additionally uh surviving spouses or
 
05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
surviving dependent sole recourse would
 
05:27:44.548 --> 05:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
be through workers compensation and then
 
05:27:46.470 --> 05:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
just lastly again being mindful of your
 
05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
time one thing that we had wanted to
 
05:27:49.990 --> 05:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
point out was just the scope of this at
 
05:27:52.270 --> 05:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
least for our limited slice and again
 
05:27:54.708 --> 05:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
I'm only talking about employees in the
 
05:27:57.430 --> 05:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
context of workers comp but I went back
 
05:27:59.470 --> 05:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
and looked through uh basically starting
 
05:28:01.708 --> 05:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
at March one I know that uh it's not
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
easy to precisely pin when Co started or
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
where it started or anything of that
 
05:28:08.030 --> 05:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
nature but just going back to March 1st
 
05:28:11.230 --> 05:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
of 20120 uh to present date we've had
 
05:28:14.948 --> 05:28:14.958 align:start position:0%
about 35,000 workplace injuries reported
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
of those workplace injuries reported
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
roughly 3,200 of them have had some
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
designation of covid uh so that's to say
 
05:28:25.270 --> 05:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
that we've received notice uh what we
 
05:28:27.548 --> 05:28:27.558 align:start position:0%
would call a first report of injury in
 
05:28:31.150 --> 05:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
3,200 instances that uh perhaps covid
 
05:28:33.310 --> 05:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
was happening just one thing I would
 
05:28:35.548 --> 05:28:35.558 align:start position:0%
note is a first report of in uh first
 
05:28:37.990 --> 05:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
report of injury is not an indication
 
05:28:40.350 --> 05:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
that it's an accepted claim and it's not
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
an acknowledgement by the employer that
 
05:28:43.868 --> 05:28:43.878 align:start position:0%
covid was definitively determined to
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
have been caused by work I just point
 
05:28:48.510 --> 05:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
out that we have had those notices of
 
05:28:51.590 --> 05:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
injuries lastly in term terms of context
 
05:28:53.788 --> 05:28:53.798 align:start position:0%
or scope and scale one thing I would
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
point out is to date we've had six
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
hearings uh dealing with uh
 
05:29:01.390 --> 05:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
determinations on whether uh workers
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
compensation benefits such as Indemnity
 
05:29:06.628 --> 05:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
or medical bills had to be provided for
 
05:29:09.230 --> 05:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with covid as the noted injury
 
05:29:11.948 --> 05:29:11.958 align:start position:0%
we've had six of those hearings to date
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
um and we've had one Hearing in which
 
05:29:14.910 --> 05:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
05:29:17.590 --> 05:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
determination that the covid was uh an
 
05:29:20.110 --> 05:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
injury resolving or resulting out of
 
05:29:22.230 --> 05:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
work I do take note of the fact and I
 
05:29:24.510 --> 05:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
think it was a very good comment uh that
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
proving CO's tie or CO's Genesis being
 
05:29:30.190 --> 05:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
from work or from a particular place is
 
05:29:32.070 --> 05:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
difficult ult um I don't think that
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's something that's an easy case to
 
05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
make uh but again we've had one case in
 
05:29:38.270 --> 05:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
which that case was made and there was a
 
05:29:40.190 --> 05:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
determination so I'm happy to take any
 
05:29:41.590 --> 05:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
questions and I would just acknowledge
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
up front that my purview is limited to
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
workers compensation and the reason we
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
decided to speak on this bill was just
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
the fact that in paragraph 7B there was
 
05:29:52.510 --> 05:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
specific reference to the fact that
 
05:29:55.750 --> 05:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
nothing here was to impact or uh undo
 
05:29:58.708 --> 05:29:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:04.990 --> 05:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you could you please
 
05:30:08.350 --> 05:30:08.360 align:start position:0%

05:30:10.150 --> 05:30:10.160 align:start position:0%

correct any further
 
05:30:25.030 --> 05:30:25.040 align:start position:0%

hi

05:32:04.750 --> 05:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
welcome my name is Anthony scullen brini
 
05:32:10.030 --> 05:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer in nashwa and I am opposed
 
05:32:12.430 --> 05:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
to this bill I want I to give the
 
05:32:14.670 --> 05:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee a couple of uh
 
05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
explanations about things that that have
 
05:32:18.110 --> 05:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
come up in the past one of the things
 
05:32:20.070 --> 05:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned at the outset was
 
05:32:22.548 --> 05:32:22.558 align:start position:0%
immunity for certain universities I
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
happen to be from Ohio Ohio state is a
 
05:32:27.430 --> 05:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
core part of the identity of every
 
05:32:30.190 --> 05:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
person from Ohio uh especially Ohio
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
State football it's really hard to draw
 
05:32:35.830 --> 05:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
comparisons between universities like
 
05:32:37.708 --> 05:32:37.718 align:start position:0%
that and the state of New Hampshire for
 
05:32:39.990 --> 05:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
example if Ohio state was a city in New
 
05:32:41.670 --> 05:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it would be the third largest
 
05:32:43.510 --> 05:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
city in the state it's bigger than
 
05:32:46.868 --> 05:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
conquered by about 20,000 people so the
 
05:32:49.070 --> 05:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
idea that those sorts of states with
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
those sorts of uh populations and levels
 
05:32:53.788 --> 05:32:53.798 align:start position:0%
of exposure to covid should be informing
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
how the New Hampshire legislature
 
05:32:57.470 --> 05:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
creates bills I don't think that's a
 
05:33:00.030 --> 05:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
fair comparison a couple of other things
 
05:33:02.548 --> 05:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to point out when uh
 
05:33:04.310 --> 05:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative Pedra was talking about
 
05:33:06.230 --> 05:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
negligence it's important to remember
 
05:33:08.788 --> 05:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
what lawyers would have to prove in
 
05:33:11.270 --> 05:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
court to show negligence so negligence
 
05:33:13.708 --> 05:33:13.718 align:start position:0%
is as he said acting below the standard
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
of Care Act not using reasonable care
 
05:33:18.990 --> 05:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
but the lawyers have to prove that there
 
05:33:21.390 --> 05:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
was a duty of care owed to the person
 
05:33:23.430 --> 05:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
that the conduct of the defendant
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
breached that duty of care and most
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
importantly for determinations of of
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
liability under covid that that breach
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
of Duty caused the harm so it's not
 
05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
simply the case that you could go to
 
05:33:39.708 --> 05:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
court and Prevail on a claim where you
 
05:33:42.190 --> 05:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
know there as come up a couple times
 
05:33:43.470 --> 05:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
students were walking around a
 
05:33:46.110 --> 05:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
University campus and not wearing masks
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
and then somebody on the other side of
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
Campus got covid you'd have to show a
 
05:33:53.390 --> 05:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
link between that behavior the the way
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
that behavior would breach not this
 
05:33:56.910 --> 05:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
those other students but the
 
05:33:59.670 --> 05:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
University's duty of care and then you
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
would have to tie those together with
 
05:34:02.910 --> 05:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of almost certainly Med
 
05:34:04.350 --> 05:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
medical testimony to show that there was
 
05:34:07.310 --> 05:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
a link in terms of causation um the
 
05:34:08.590 --> 05:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
other things that I wanted to point out
 
05:34:11.350 --> 05:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
about the Bell is that the standard of
 
05:34:12.910 --> 05:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
proof and a burden of proof are two
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
different things so that the burden of
 
05:34:17.470 --> 05:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
proof is sort of how much stuff you have
 
05:34:20.150 --> 05:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
to carry and the standard of proof is
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
how high you have to carry that stuff
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
and in both cases they are defined in
 
05:34:27.270 --> 05:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
ways that are really unprecedented in
 
05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
civil law in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:34:31.590 --> 05:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
gross NE negligence is almost never the
 
05:34:33.750 --> 05:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
standard and the system has worked quite
 
05:34:35.590 --> 05:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
well as uh representative Pedra has
 
05:34:38.110 --> 05:34:38.120 align:start position:0%
pointed out for Centuries with just the
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
regular NE negligence standard uh second
 
05:34:43.070 --> 05:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
on the St uh the burden of or that was
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof on the standard of
 
05:34:46.628 --> 05:34:46.638 align:start position:0%
proof clear and convincing evidence is
 
05:34:49.868 --> 05:34:49.878 align:start position:0%
generally used in places where the state
 
05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
wants to commit people that is take away
 
05:34:54.430 --> 05:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
their freedom and hold them such as when
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're committed for mental health
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
issues to the New Hampshire hospital so
 
05:35:00.590 --> 05:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
having that as a as the bird as the
 
05:35:02.708 --> 05:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
standard of proof in a case like this
 
05:35:05.708 --> 05:35:05.718 align:start position:0%
where the lawyer is you know exploring
 
05:35:07.270 --> 05:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
these new medical issues that raised by
 
05:35:08.788 --> 05:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
covid and the person that he's
 
05:35:12.150 --> 05:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
representing is already sick and injured
 
05:35:14.070 --> 05:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
I think that both of those things are
 
05:35:16.948 --> 05:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
unprecedented and far too high one thing
 
05:35:18.350 --> 05:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
that the representative from the
 
05:35:19.708 --> 05:35:19.718 align:start position:0%
University mentioned that I want to
 
05:35:22.990 --> 05:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
point out was this idea of changing uh
 
05:35:25.510 --> 05:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
changing recommendations and there's no
 
05:35:27.350 --> 05:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
one that's going to doubt that the CDC
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
has come out with new and ever changing
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations about how covid should
 
05:35:34.350 --> 05:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
be handled but that's simply the way
 
05:35:36.990 --> 05:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
that science works and the law has had a
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
lot of experience dealing with new and
 
05:35:41.788 --> 05:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
emerging science if you look back at the
 
05:35:44.310 --> 05:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
litigation surrounding water pollution
 
05:35:45.948 --> 05:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
or if you look back at the litigation
 
05:35:48.390 --> 05:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding asbest these are things that
 
05:35:50.150 --> 05:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
the the law is equipped to handle and
 
05:35:51.628 --> 05:35:51.638 align:start position:0%
they deal with it very well and they
 
05:35:53.708 --> 05:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
have dealt with it very well for at
 
05:35:55.230 --> 05:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
least a hundred years now that we've had
 
05:35:57.190 --> 05:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
sort of scientifically informed
 
05:35:59.310 --> 05:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
litigation and while the standards
 
05:35:59.320 --> 05:36:00.548 align:start position:0%
litigation and while the standards
change

05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:36:02.470 --> 05:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
the the the standard for holding
 
05:36:03.990 --> 05:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
somebody liable which is what
 
05:36:06.670 --> 05:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
representative P represent referenced
 
05:36:08.590 --> 05:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
about reasonable care that doesn't
 
05:36:11.190 --> 05:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
change and that allows the court to take
 
05:36:13.868 --> 05:36:13.878 align:start position:0%
into account these updated um
 
05:36:15.830 --> 05:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations such as how to deal with
 
05:36:18.310 --> 05:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
co uh I think that it's also important
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
to point out that whether you're a
 
05:36:23.070 --> 05:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
liberal or conservative that immunities
 
05:36:25.310 --> 05:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
are the kind of things that the law give
 
05:36:27.390 --> 05:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh gives rise to unintended consequences
 
05:36:30.590 --> 05:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
in the law I'm sure that no one one that
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
sponsored the internet service provider
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill that provided immunity for uh
 
05:36:38.310 --> 05:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
online platforms thought that it would
 
05:36:40.190 --> 05:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
have an impact on the political
 
05:36:42.830 --> 05:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
discourse uh later on you know 10 or 15
 
05:36:45.150 --> 05:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
years down the line the reality is when
 
05:36:47.910 --> 05:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
you bake an immunity into the law you
 
05:36:50.548 --> 05:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
are all but guaranteeing un unintended
 
05:36:52.750 --> 05:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
consequences and then finally I do think
 
05:36:54.830 --> 05:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
that there is a possibility that by
 
05:36:57.788 --> 05:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
setting the standard so high setting the
 
05:37:00.070 --> 05:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
burden of proof so high in other words
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's more than mere negligence that what
 
05:37:03.628 --> 05:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
would end up happening is it would put
 
05:37:05.548 --> 05:37:05.558 align:start position:0%
the mom and popop businesses that are
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
sort of tacked onto this education bill
 
05:37:10.590 --> 05:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
in an odd spot that is that they could
 
05:37:12.548 --> 05:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
have an insurance policy that covers
 
05:37:14.868 --> 05:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
negligent acts but because the standard
 
05:37:16.750 --> 05:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
of the burden of proof is defined so
 
05:37:18.788 --> 05:37:18.798 align:start position:0%
high here that they would they would
 
05:37:20.708 --> 05:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
fall out of insurance coverage and would
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
actually be worse for them than it would
 
05:37:24.788 --> 05:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
be if the standard of proof was or the
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
burden of proof was lower in other words
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
if the burden of proof is gross
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
negligence or hire and the liability
 
05:37:34.910 --> 05:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
policy says we only cover negligent acts
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
then when they get sued the insurance
 
05:37:38.990 --> 05:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
company could simply walk away and leave
 
05:37:41.070 --> 05:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
them to their own devices and for those
 
05:37:42.830 --> 05:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
reasons I oppose this bill and I think
 
05:37:44.990 --> 05:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
that you should not vote for it and I'm
 
05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions anybody
 
05:37:46.400 --> 05:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions anybody
might

05:37:47.190 --> 05:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
might
 
05:37:51.230 --> 05:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
have thank you very much do I see any
 
05:37:54.788 --> 05:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I do not
 
05:37:57.788 --> 05:37:57.798 align:start position:0%
believe uh you have any questions thank
 
05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
you for your time you get on to your
 
05:38:03.788 --> 05:38:03.798 align:start position:0%
next piece of business next thank you
 
05:38:06.470 --> 05:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you go back to I was questioning
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:14.030 --> 05:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
back thank you very much Representatives
 
05:38:15.788 --> 05:38:15.798 align:start position:0%
um I would actually ask that you you
 
05:38:18.750 --> 05:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
defer um to the other attorneys first I
 
05:38:21.110 --> 05:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
take up a lot of their um billable hours
 
05:38:23.070 --> 05:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
for free by asking them to testify in
 
05:38:25.470 --> 05:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
front of the legislature and they have I
 
05:38:27.150 --> 05:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
I am actually paid to be at this hearing
 
05:38:28.868 --> 05:38:28.878 align:start position:0%
so I am more than happy to go towards
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the hearing hearing and I
 
05:38:31.948 --> 05:38:31.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate if that's possible I know
 
05:38:33.868 --> 05:38:33.878 align:start position:0%
Rory Parnell for example also has a
 
05:38:37.628 --> 05:38:37.638 align:start position:0%
hearing at 3 I apologize I'm sorry did
 
05:38:40.670 --> 05:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
she say the name what was the name uh
 
05:38:44.270 --> 05:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
Rory Parnell okay I don't see I don't
 
05:38:48.310 --> 05:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
see him on on the testify list but okay
 
05:38:54.548 --> 05:38:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:00.310 --> 05:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
call Mr Carnell um your your next
 
05:39:04.110 --> 05:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
hello I assume you all can hear me yes
 
05:39:07.070 --> 05:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you uh chair and
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for taking
 
05:39:12.150 --> 05:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
the time uh to listen to us uh I
 
05:39:14.750 --> 05:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
testifying an opposition of this bill
 
05:39:16.670 --> 05:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
and primarily I'm focused on the
 
05:39:19.310 --> 05:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of this for those that
 
05:39:21.430 --> 05:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
have been around long enough there was a
 
05:39:25.070 --> 05:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
medical malpractice statute p uh many
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
years ago that included a uh reduction
 
05:39:32.670 --> 05:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
in the statute of limitations including
 
05:39:35.868 --> 05:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to that a provision that
 
05:39:37.750 --> 05:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
affected the evidentiary burden as it
 
05:39:38.990 --> 05:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:39:42.590 --> 05:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
experts and the Supreme Court ended up
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
taking up this case or taking up that
 
05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
statute on appeal and found the statute
 
05:39:52.708 --> 05:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and I think there is
 
05:39:55.590 --> 05:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
significant concern that this bill as
 
05:39:58.110 --> 05:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
written uh limiting the statute of
 
05:40:02.590 --> 05:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
limitations and and increasing the uh
 
05:40:05.150 --> 05:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
standard of negligence could result in
 
05:40:07.030 --> 05:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
this bill being overturned is
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and the case was Carson
 
05:40:10.160 --> 05:40:11.590 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and the case was Carson
V

05:40:11.590 --> 05:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
V
 
05:40:15.070 --> 05:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
Moore the the problem as noted in that
 
05:40:15.080 --> 05:40:16.270 align:start position:0%
Moore the the problem as noted in that
case

05:40:16.270 --> 05:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:40:22.030 --> 05:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
was the Statute uh without providing any
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh additional caveat to Simply
 
05:40:26.948 --> 05:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
restricted the statute of limitations
 
05:40:30.910 --> 05:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
without more and the the uh Court the
 
05:40:33.150 --> 05:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court found that this was
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and reversed that that
 
05:40:38.830 --> 05:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
provision now the the court in that case
 
05:40:40.430 --> 05:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
examined article one and two of our
 
05:40:42.750 --> 05:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
constitution equal protection clause
 
05:40:47.910 --> 05:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
which are obviously uh huge parts of our
 
05:40:49.910 --> 05:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh Foundation of our government but the
 
05:40:51.868 --> 05:40:51.878 align:start position:0%
other thing that it's important to at
 
05:40:54.150 --> 05:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
least reference with these immunity
 
05:40:58.150 --> 05:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
bills is they are taking away the right
 
05:40:59.788 --> 05:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
of jury trial
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I I
 
05:41:04.910 --> 05:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
want to point out one of the the
 
05:41:08.230 --> 05:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
statements in article 20 um of our state
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
constitution on the Bill of Rights where
 
05:41:12.750 --> 05:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
it talks about the jury trial and civil
 
05:41:14.708 --> 05:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
causes and there's some very interesting
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
language there that I've always found
 
05:41:19.910 --> 05:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
fascinating that um our Founders and the
 
05:41:22.230 --> 05:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
drafters of our state constitution used
 
05:41:24.670 --> 05:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
and in that provision they say in
 
05:41:27.868 --> 05:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
referencing the jury trial right they
 
05:41:29.670 --> 05:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
say this method or procedure shall be
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
held sacred sacred that is a very
 
05:41:37.150 --> 05:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
important use of that term because it
 
05:41:41.628 --> 05:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
provides a higher standard in using that
 
05:41:45.310 --> 05:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
language as far as what a right of a
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
citizen is to seek redress in the courts
 
05:41:50.948 --> 05:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and this immunity bill
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
will abgate that right under article 20
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
and reduce access to jury trials for
 
05:41:58.798 --> 05:41:59.750 align:start position:0%
and reduce access to jury trials for
those

05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:42:02.070 --> 05:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
that would potentially be injured and I
 
05:42:03.670 --> 05:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
want to Echo one of the things that
 
05:42:06.430 --> 05:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
representative Pedra referenced is that
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
despite this occurring for over a year
 
05:42:12.110 --> 05:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
this pandemic that has had such a a
 
05:42:14.590 --> 05:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
detrimental effect on our economy and
 
05:42:17.590 --> 05:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
our citizens and frankly our psyches
 
05:42:21.590 --> 05:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
there have been no zero cases involving
 
05:42:25.468 --> 05:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
injuries with covid and this bill is a a
 
05:42:30.270 --> 05:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem um
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
so when you are considering this bill
 
05:42:36.548 --> 05:42:36.558 align:start position:0%
it's important to factor in what is the
 
05:42:39.708 --> 05:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
foundation of our rights especially as
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
what I affectionately call a Libertarian
 
05:42:44.750 --> 05:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
state that we are that allows the
 
05:42:46.430 --> 05:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
freedom of our citizens that other
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
states simply don't provide and this
 
05:42:52.910 --> 05:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill will chip away at those rights of
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
our citizens to seek address in the
 
05:42:58.270 --> 05:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
courts and really based on it is how it
 
05:43:01.070 --> 05:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
is currently DED drafted there is real
 
05:43:04.150 --> 05:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
risk uh that this bill will just be
 
05:43:07.150 --> 05:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
overturned as unconstitutional because
 
05:43:11.070 --> 05:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
it violates those sacred Clauses of our
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and so as you consider the
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
passing of this bill or the rejection of
 
05:43:18.070 --> 05:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
this bill we ask that you vote against
 
05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
it because it is unconstitutional as
 
05:43:26.230 --> 05:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
written and in front of a court that uh
 
05:43:29.150 --> 05:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
respects our libertarian principles and
 
05:43:32.830 --> 05:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
respects what is a sacred jury right uh
 
05:43:34.990 --> 05:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
it it serves a substantial chance of
 
05:43:38.310 --> 05:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
being overturned just like the uh
 
05:43:41.990 --> 05:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
malpractice bill was so many years ago
 
05:43:45.150 --> 05:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
and one uh clarification point I know
 
05:43:48.150 --> 05:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
this was mentioned um uh the standard of
 
05:43:50.670 --> 05:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
gross negligence it's important to note
 
05:43:52.910 --> 05:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does not have a
 
05:43:57.390 --> 05:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
common law gross negligence standard uh
 
05:43:59.548 --> 05:43:59.558 align:start position:0%
specifically it is only provided for by
 
05:44:02.990 --> 05:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
Statute uh so common law is case law so
 
05:44:05.910 --> 05:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
we do not have a gradient of negligence
 
05:44:09.030 --> 05:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the state we uh have a basic
 
05:44:11.948 --> 05:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
negligence standard as uh representative
 
05:44:15.190 --> 05:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
pader has noted has been uh successful
 
05:44:18.628 --> 05:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
and reasonable for hundreds of years and
 
05:44:20.350 --> 05:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that this
 
05:44:22.750 --> 05:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
actually would go beyond the current
 
05:44:25.230 --> 05:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
case law and establish uh gross
 
05:44:28.708 --> 05:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
negligence that is not present currently
 
05:44:32.270 --> 05:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
so so this bill is really a solution in
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
search of a problem again there are no
 
05:44:36.990 --> 05:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
pending cases and moving up to statute
 
05:44:39.230 --> 05:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
of limitations and changing the standard
 
05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
of care really presents uh
 
05:44:45.070 --> 05:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional problems to this statute
 
05:44:47.670 --> 05:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh should it be passed and uh we I I
 
05:44:49.948 --> 05:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
certainly uh am of the position that
 
05:44:51.708 --> 05:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
this uh should not be passed and should
 
05:44:54.670 --> 05:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
be rejected I'm happy to take any
 
05:44:57.750 --> 05:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank youne Corell any
 
05:45:01.270 --> 05:45:01.280 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire and I also serve as
 
05:45:48.110 --> 05:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
legislative chair for the New Hampshire
 
05:45:51.750 --> 05:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
Association for justice um the reality
 
05:45:54.830 --> 05:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
today is that Israel Pedra
 
05:45:57.430 --> 05:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative Pedra um attorney skull
 
05:46:00.030 --> 05:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
brini and attorney part
 
05:46:03.750 --> 05:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
have have framed the issues and and um
 
05:46:07.510 --> 05:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
explained them exceedingly well and um I
 
05:46:09.868 --> 05:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
Echo the all the the sentiments that
 
05:46:13.788 --> 05:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
they've put forth I guess in in the
 
05:46:16.390 --> 05:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
interest of of time and and being
 
05:46:19.468 --> 05:46:19.478 align:start position:0%
succinct here as to you know what some
 
05:46:21.468 --> 05:46:21.478 align:start position:0%
of the arguments are against this and I
 
05:46:23.070 --> 05:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
am arguing in
 
05:46:26.110 --> 05:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
opposition um I guess I would just uh
 
05:46:28.830 --> 05:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
emphasize um one other aspect of this
 
05:46:31.468 --> 05:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
and that is the Practical realities of
 
05:46:33.510 --> 05:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
if a case like this were to you know
 
05:46:35.750 --> 05:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
come into my office or and I'm certainly
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
not speaking for all attorneys but you
 
05:46:39.868 --> 05:46:39.878 align:start position:0%
know uh it were were to come into I
 
05:46:43.868 --> 05:46:43.878 align:start position:0%
think the the average civil litigators
 
05:46:47.788 --> 05:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
office and that's that um as attorney
 
05:46:50.788 --> 05:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
scol bini indicated um we're going to
 
05:46:54.948 --> 05:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
explain to a potential client that you
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to need to prove um to a
 
05:46:59.270 --> 05:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
unanimous jury
 
05:46:59.280 --> 05:47:00.230 align:start position:0%
unanimous jury
that

05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
someone um that a business or an entity
 
05:47:06.190 --> 05:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
acted unreasonably and that this
 
05:47:09.150 --> 05:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
unreasonable conduct was what caused the
 
05:47:11.788 --> 05:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
harm what caused the the infection and
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
subsequent issues surrounding that and
 
05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
that is going to be exceedingly
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
difficult in in every situation with
 
05:47:21.510 --> 05:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
respect to to
 
05:47:24.830 --> 05:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um and you know just because
 
05:47:27.670 --> 05:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
someone someone contracted covid-19 in a
 
05:47:29.390 --> 05:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
particular place doesn't mean that that
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
business or entity was a bad actor or
 
05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
you know should be subject to a finding
 
05:47:38.868 --> 05:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
of liability um that conduct must be
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
unreasonable um another practical
 
05:47:42.910 --> 05:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
reality that people should be aware of
 
05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
is that because most individuals you
 
05:47:47.990 --> 05:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
know don't have the money to pay out of
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
pocket for legal fees um and and the
 
05:47:54.190 --> 05:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
average personal injury matter or in a
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
case like this these things are handle
 
05:47:57.948 --> 05:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
handled on a contingent fee basis and
 
05:47:59.590 --> 05:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's the attorney
 
05:48:02.510 --> 05:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
who uh fronts the the money for things
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
like medical experts and in a covid-19
 
05:48:07.750 --> 05:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
case you're going to have possibly
 
05:48:10.030 --> 05:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
numerous medical experts you might have
 
05:48:11.230 --> 05:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
doctors and Physicians that were
 
05:48:12.510 --> 05:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
actually treating the patient you're
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
going to have um epidemiologists you're
 
05:48:17.070 --> 05:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
going to have experts with respect to to
 
05:48:19.628 --> 05:48:19.638 align:start position:0%
transmission and um this is going to be
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
exceedingly expensive so the combination
 
05:48:26.548 --> 05:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
of the likely difficulty in proving that
 
05:48:28.590 --> 05:48:28.600 align:start position:0%
um The Entity to be sued acted on
 
05:48:31.868 --> 05:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
unreasonably and caused you know the the
 
05:48:35.350 --> 05:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
actual injury or illness um that
 
05:48:38.910 --> 05:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
combined with the the need to you know
 
05:48:40.990 --> 05:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
make upfront expenditures which may be
 
05:48:44.070 --> 05:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
exorbitant in these cases makes it very
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
unlikely these cases um are going to be
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
brought attorney Parnell is correct this
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
is essentially a solution in search of a
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
problem um to date um Nationwide it's
 
05:48:58.350 --> 05:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
our understanding that there is there
 
05:49:01.110 --> 05:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
are approximately 400 cases Nationwide
 
05:49:03.948 --> 05:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
after more than 26 million cases and
 
05:49:05.590 --> 05:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
four and more than
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
450,000 deaths um these cases aren't
 
05:49:10.868 --> 05:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
happening they're not happening in New
 
05:49:14.750 --> 05:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um I would come back to
 
05:49:16.430 --> 05:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
the the point that all the attorneys
 
05:49:18.310 --> 05:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
especially attorney Parnell has made is
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
that this this is generally an
 
05:49:22.990 --> 05:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional act to create
 
05:49:25.750 --> 05:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
immunities like this immunities breed
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
irresponsibility and they really have no
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
place in our body of laws um with that I
 
05:49:33.788 --> 05:49:33.798 align:start position:0%
would take any questions the panel may
 
05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
have very
 
05:49:38.590 --> 05:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
much questions I see one
 
05:49:42.110 --> 05:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
fromer start uh thank you Mr chair uh
 
05:49:43.868 --> 05:49:43.878 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
05:49:46.230 --> 05:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
don't believe this has been asked yet
 
05:49:48.350 --> 05:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
but isn't my understanding that there is
 
05:49:49.628 --> 05:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
a limited
 
05:49:54.030 --> 05:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
liability uh for hospitals and uh First
 
05:49:56.990 --> 05:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
Responders uh regarding this how does if
 
05:50:00.270 --> 05:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
they have that how does that relate to
 
05:50:02.270 --> 05:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
what's being proposed in this particular
 
05:50:04.628 --> 05:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
Bill yes sir it's my understanding and I
 
05:50:07.510 --> 05:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
believe that back in April of 2020 there
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
was an attorney general opinion that um
 
05:50:13.788 --> 05:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
the immunities provided in RSA 21 p41
 
05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
apply to Emer entities um engaged in
 
05:50:20.468 --> 05:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management activities um uh I
 
05:50:23.190 --> 05:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
will I I don't know the exact status of
 
05:50:26.350 --> 05:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
that I believe that that that is renewed
 
05:50:28.468 --> 05:50:28.478 align:start position:0%
at this point but there's certainly been
 
05:50:32.310 --> 05:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
actions taken to provide for that so uh
 
05:50:35.230 --> 05:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
we can certainly um you know submit you
 
05:50:37.390 --> 05:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
know any additional information on that
 
05:50:39.670 --> 05:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
question be happy to do that for you sir
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
but um yes I believe there are
 
05:50:45.110 --> 05:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
Protections in place thank you thank you
 
05:50:45.120 --> 05:50:46.910 align:start position:0%
Protections in place thank you thank you
represent

05:50:46.910 --> 05:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:50:50.190 --> 05:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chair um I have a
 
05:50:52.590 --> 05:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
question about the the communicable
 
05:50:55.750 --> 05:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
disease itself the fact that covid-19 is
 
05:50:58.510 --> 05:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
is listed in this bill and we know it's
 
05:51:01.788 --> 05:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
you know viruses mutate um may even have
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
a different name number to it um and
 
05:51:06.750 --> 05:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
there's other communicable diseases as
 
05:51:10.590 --> 05:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
well does this bill narrowly uh very
 
05:51:15.948 --> 05:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:18.670 --> 05:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
virus it thank you for the question um
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner uh the bill would
 
05:51:24.830 --> 05:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
appear as I read it if if we look at
 
05:51:28.708 --> 05:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
page one lines four and five um uh
 
05:51:29.990 --> 05:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
pertaining to limited liability for
 
05:51:31.990 --> 05:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education for
 
05:51:34.948 --> 05:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
personal uh injury resulting from a
 
05:51:36.910 --> 05:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
relating to covid-19 I believe the
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
specificity is there with respect to
 
05:51:40.910 --> 05:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
covid-19 but that's not to say that
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't set a generally bad precedent
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:48.948 --> 05:51:48.958 align:start position:0%

me they're asking me all of these other
 
05:53:03.230 --> 05:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
questions I have had no individuals or
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
families come to me and say they're
 
05:53:07.910 --> 05:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
exploring the possibility of bringing a
 
05:53:10.868 --> 05:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
covid-19 lawsuit against anybody I've
 
05:53:13.070 --> 05:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
had no experience with that and I've
 
05:53:15.868 --> 05:53:15.878 align:start position:0%
been doing a lot of
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
cases what I would like to say is what I
 
05:53:22.868 --> 05:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
had the privilege of in
 
05:53:25.548 --> 05:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
2012 arguing to the New Hampshire
 
05:53:28.708 --> 05:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the Tom Morgan case
 
05:53:30.670 --> 05:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
and there's some language in that case
 
05:53:33.670 --> 05:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court emphasized in New
 
05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what is the very moral fabric
 
05:53:39.468 --> 05:53:39.478 align:start position:0%
of civilized society and here's the
 
05:53:41.030 --> 05:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
words they
 
05:53:44.948 --> 05:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
used responsibility for personal
 
05:53:48.110 --> 05:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
malfeasance runs through all relations
 
05:53:48.120 --> 05:53:48.990 align:start position:0%
malfeasance runs through all relations
of

05:53:48.990 --> 05:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:53:53.590 --> 05:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
individuals each of us to the
 
05:53:56.910 --> 05:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
other that is the New Hampshire
 
05:54:00.230 --> 05:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
way this this bill would remove that
 
05:54:00.240 --> 05:54:01.350 align:start position:0%
way this this bill would remove that
moral

05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
moral
 
05:54:04.670 --> 05:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
Fabric and would remove the reasonable
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
standard that we owe each to the other I
 
05:54:14.190 --> 05:54:14.200 align:start position:0%

05:54:16.150 --> 05:54:16.160 align:start position:0%

05:54:21.270 --> 05:54:21.280 align:start position:0%

05:56:02.190 --> 05:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
so that does not cost the B when a claim
 
05:56:03.708 --> 05:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
is filed for workers comp it does not
 
05:56:07.350 --> 05:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
cost the business additionally um and I
 
05:56:10.350 --> 05:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
believe that um successful workers comp
 
05:56:13.030 --> 05:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
claim was from a hospital worker so that
 
05:56:16.990 --> 05:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
just makes sense to me as someone that
 
05:56:18.830 --> 05:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
plays an attorney not someone who's a
 
05:56:18.840 --> 05:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
plays an attorney not someone who's a
practicing

05:56:19.830 --> 05:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
practicing
 
05:56:22.430 --> 05:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
attorney um one more thing I'd like to
 
05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
note is this and just want to emphasize
 
05:56:26.548 --> 05:56:26.558 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written and I think
 
05:56:28.590 --> 05:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
the attorneys did a great job of noting
 
05:56:31.230 --> 05:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
that the liability St or the standard
 
05:56:34.468 --> 05:56:34.478 align:start position:0%
raised to a knowing act um I'm happy to
 
05:56:37.548 --> 05:56:37.558 align:start position:0%
send the committee sample liability
 
05:56:40.510 --> 05:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
policies that are regulated um by the
 
05:56:44.070 --> 05:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
industry across across the country um
 
05:56:47.628 --> 05:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
that generally exclude knowing acts so
 
05:56:49.468 --> 05:56:49.478 align:start position:0%
just trying to you know dumb it down
 
05:56:52.708 --> 05:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
from some legal jargon um as I try to do
 
05:56:57.510 --> 05:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
every day in my job The Knowing act if
 
05:56:57.520 --> 05:56:58.430 align:start position:0%
every day in my job The Knowing act if
if

05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:57:00.390 --> 05:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
if a claim were brought to the standards
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
set out in this bill which again they
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
probably won't because it would be
 
05:57:06.868 --> 05:57:06.878 align:start position:0%
impossible to prove nearly impossible to
 
05:57:09.868 --> 05:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
prove unless it was totally
 
05:57:13.270 --> 05:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
egregious an insurance comp an
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
insurance um insurance company who
 
05:57:20.310 --> 05:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
represents or covers a small business
 
05:57:22.150 --> 05:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
would point to The Knowing act and say
 
05:57:23.910 --> 05:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
this is the language in your policy we
 
05:57:25.708 --> 05:57:25.718 align:start position:0%
won't cover you from this you're on the
 
05:57:27.990 --> 05:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
hook for defending this yourself this
 
05:57:30.830 --> 05:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill does not as written would not help
 
05:57:32.548 --> 05:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
small businesses it would actually help
 
05:57:35.830 --> 05:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies um so happy to
 
05:57:37.468 --> 05:57:37.478 align:start position:0%
answer any questions provide any or
 
05:57:39.070 --> 05:57:39.080 align:start position:0%

05:57:41.468 --> 05:57:41.478 align:start position:0%

05:58:01.070 --> 05:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
last um person to testify is David prer
 
05:58:03.310 --> 05:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
and I believe you're with the Bia
 
05:58:05.590 --> 05:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct uh for the
 
05:58:08.070 --> 05:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
record I'm David ker director of public
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
policy at the business and industry
 
05:58:12.788 --> 05:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire uh we are
 
05:58:15.430 --> 05:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
in strong support of this bill um and
 
05:58:17.628 --> 05:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
we're not alone uh we recently sent a
 
05:58:21.230 --> 05:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
letter to policy leaders uh urging the
 
05:58:23.150 --> 05:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
passage of some sort of Safe Harbor
 
05:58:25.430 --> 05:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and co-signed on that were
 
05:58:27.750 --> 05:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
nearly three dozen other chambers of
 
05:58:30.708 --> 05:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
Commerce and uh trade associations
 
05:58:33.230 --> 05:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
around the state um I want to clear up
 
05:58:35.670 --> 05:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
some I think misconceptions about the
 
05:58:39.430 --> 05:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh as is written and as we read it
 
05:58:42.510 --> 05:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
um these Safe Harbor protections uh an
 
05:58:45.270 --> 05:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
important limitation on these is that
 
05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
they really only protect businesses that
 
05:58:49.628 --> 05:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
are following state and federal
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
guidelines in good faith so it's not a
 
05:58:55.948 --> 05:58:55.958 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity uh it won't protect uh
 
05:58:58.948 --> 05:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
Bad actors in You businesses who are not
 
05:59:01.270 --> 05:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
following those guidelines and we don't
 
05:59:03.230 --> 05:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
believe that it should cover those um
 
05:59:05.868 --> 05:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
you know if you aren't doing everything
 
05:59:08.270 --> 05:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
you can to help us prevent the spread of
 
05:59:10.430 --> 05:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 during this pandemic then you
 
05:59:13.868 --> 05:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
should be held accountable for that um
 
05:59:16.110 --> 05:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
05:59:19.070 --> 05:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
99.99999% of businesses out there uh
 
05:59:20.788 --> 05:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
really are following all of the
 
05:59:23.548 --> 05:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
guidelines as best as uh you know
 
05:59:26.270 --> 05:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
possible um so this would help protect
 
05:59:29.548 --> 05:59:29.558 align:start position:0%
them against loss suits uh from a number
 
05:59:31.910 --> 05:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
of third parties who would possibly
 
05:59:34.670 --> 05:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
claim that they contracted covid-19 at
 
05:59:34.680 --> 05:59:35.670 align:start position:0%
claim that they contracted covid-19 at
that

05:59:35.670 --> 05:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
business uh I you know I've heard it
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
several times today that well we haven't
 
05:59:42.750 --> 05:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
had any of these filed in New Hampshire
 
05:59:46.510 --> 05:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not a problem well we shouldn't
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
wait for it to become a problem before
 
05:59:50.910 --> 05:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
making this legislation we should do
 
05:59:52.868 --> 05:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
this now to prevent it from ever
 
05:59:55.390 --> 05:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
becoming a problem in the first place uh
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know if those I think it was
 
05:59:59.708 --> 05:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think someone said uh 400
 
06:00:01.390 --> 06:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuits filed around the country
 
06:00:03.310 --> 06:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
already uh you know if those are
 
06:00:05.150 --> 06:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
starting to become successful it is
 
06:00:07.590 --> 06:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly going to come uh to New
 
06:00:10.868 --> 06:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well um we also heard some
 
06:00:13.350 --> 06:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
businesses aren't worried about this I'm
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
telling you uh as the viia all of our
 
06:00:19.868 --> 06:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
members are worried about this this is
 
06:00:22.270 --> 06:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
one of the top concerns uh that we are
 
06:00:24.788 --> 06:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
hearing from our members uh both large
 
06:00:27.468 --> 06:00:27.478 align:start position:0%
and small you know uh 70% of our members
 
06:00:29.750 --> 06:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
MERS have an annual payroll of $3
 
06:00:32.430 --> 06:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
million or less we have a lot of small
 
06:00:34.390 --> 06:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
businesses as members as well and they
 
06:00:37.150 --> 06:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
are also uh you know explaining how much
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
of an issue this could be for them in
 
06:00:41.548 --> 06:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
fact we've started to hear or we've
 
06:00:45.110 --> 06:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
heard a story about a business um last
 
06:00:47.350 --> 06:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
year that when businesses started to
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
reopen they said that they weren't going
 
06:00:51.548 --> 06:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
to reopen and part of that reason was
 
06:00:52.788 --> 06:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
because they were afraid that they could
 
06:00:54.270 --> 06:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
get sued which would just put them out
 
06:00:57.948 --> 06:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
of business anyway um additionally we've
 
06:01:01.350 --> 06:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
heard that uh it would be a pretty tough
 
06:01:06.070 --> 06:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
case to uh win in court anyway but it's
 
06:01:08.628 --> 06:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
kind of also important to realize that
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
any business who is defending itself in
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
one of these lawsuits that's 3040
 
06:01:17.110 --> 06:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
$50,000 and the fact that it would be
 
06:01:19.990 --> 06:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to prove is also just
 
06:01:21.788 --> 06:01:21.798 align:start position:0%
Testament to how difficult this case
 
06:01:23.670 --> 06:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
would be if it were to go to trial which
 
06:01:25.270 --> 06:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
means it would be a long Discovery
 
06:01:27.430 --> 06:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
process there would be a lot involved
 
06:01:29.310 --> 06:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
and it would just be an expensive uh
 
06:01:33.230 --> 06:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
mess to try and deal with and further
 
06:01:34.990 --> 06:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
along those same lines we've heard that
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
this would only protect the insurance
 
06:01:39.150 --> 06:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
companies or benefit the insurance
 
06:01:41.830 --> 06:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
companies uh what we're hearing is that
 
06:01:44.548 --> 06:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
insurance policies a lot of times more
 
06:01:46.590 --> 06:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
often than not have exceptions for
 
06:01:48.868 --> 06:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases and so insurance
 
06:01:51.110 --> 06:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
would not cover the legal fees no matter
 
06:01:54.270 --> 06:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
what um the statute said uh because of
 
06:01:55.628 --> 06:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
these exceptions for communicable
 
06:01:57.830 --> 06:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
diseases and therefore you're Le your
 
06:01:59.868 --> 06:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
small businesses or you know any
 
06:02:01.708 --> 06:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
business and you know obviously I'm with
 
06:02:04.590 --> 06:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
Bia so I represent businesses other
 
06:02:06.468 --> 06:02:06.478 align:start position:0%
Enterprises hospitals but you know this
 
06:02:07.910 --> 06:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
would also affect anywhere where the
 
06:02:10.150 --> 06:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
public gathers you're talking um
 
06:02:12.070 --> 06:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities schools they all have
 
06:02:15.788 --> 06:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
this same concern but they'd be on the
 
06:02:19.948 --> 06:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
hook for these legal uh fees um and one
 
06:02:22.150 --> 06:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
more note that I just want to make is
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
that if the um business is being sued
 
06:02:29.230 --> 06:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
let's say that their claim uh even if
 
06:02:31.150 --> 06:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
it's just a prade litigant and they're
 
06:02:35.230 --> 06:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
saying okay you know I want $220,000 in
 
06:02:35.240 --> 06:02:36.628 align:start position:0%
saying okay you know I want $220,000 in
um

06:02:36.628 --> 06:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:40.468 --> 06:02:40.478 align:start position:0%
in medical expenses damages medical
 
06:02:42.670 --> 06:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
expenses well now the business has to
 
06:02:45.070 --> 06:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
weigh okay do I just give this person
 
06:02:48.070 --> 06:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
$20,000 or do I spend the 30 40 50,000
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
to defend myself uh so yeah they might
 
06:02:52.350 --> 06:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
not win but it might actually be more
 
06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
efficient for the business to settle and
 
06:02:55.628 --> 06:02:55.638 align:start position:0%
that would also be a large problem
 
06:02:57.070 --> 06:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of resources that the
 
06:02:59.070 --> 06:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
business business is now spending on
 
06:03:01.548 --> 06:03:01.558 align:start position:0%
defending itself against lawsuits rather
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
than hiring back their employees
 
06:03:05.830 --> 06:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
reinvesting in their business trying to
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
recover from their lost revenues as a
 
06:03:09.948 --> 06:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
result of this co uh Corona virus
 
06:03:12.310 --> 06:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic so it's really vitally
 
06:03:14.270 --> 06:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
important that we get bills with these
 
06:03:16.590 --> 06:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
Safe Harbor Provisions passed so that we
 
06:03:19.350 --> 06:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
can recover this economy try and move on
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
past this pandemic and with that I will
 
06:03:23.628 --> 06:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I know it's been a
 
06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
long day already uh so please if you
 
06:03:29.070 --> 06:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'm happy to answer
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I do see a question
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
from representative Cornell hi U thank
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um would it
 
06:03:39.548 --> 06:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
be true and I hope it wouldn't be that
 
06:03:41.788 --> 06:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
if businesses knew that they couldn't be
 
06:03:44.910 --> 06:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
sued for this would they might maybe not
 
06:03:47.830 --> 06:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
be as careful or put as many safeguards
 
06:03:50.510 --> 06:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
in as they as they
 
06:03:50.520 --> 06:03:52.750 align:start position:0%
in as they as they
could

06:03:52.750 --> 06:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:03:55.030 --> 06:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
just uh thank you for the question and
 
06:03:56.788 --> 06:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
it's a great question uh because we
 
06:03:58.270 --> 06:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
heard that this would just insulate
 
06:04:00.868 --> 06:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
businesses entirely uh no they they
 
06:04:02.590 --> 06:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
would absolutely be taking every
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
precaution they can um for many reasons
 
06:04:08.190 --> 06:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
not only just because of the lawsuits
 
06:04:10.030 --> 06:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
but uh you know businesses are putting
 
06:04:12.628 --> 06:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
precautions in and to try and help
 
06:04:14.948 --> 06:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread of covid-19 for
 
06:04:16.548 --> 06:04:16.558 align:start position:0%
reasons one if they have a bunch of
 
06:04:18.430 --> 06:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
people sick with covid-19 they can't run
 
06:04:20.230 --> 06:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
their business without employees so they
 
06:04:21.948 --> 06:04:21.958 align:start position:0%
want to help uh prevent the spread of
 
06:04:25.830 --> 06:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
covid-19 for that um two uh obviously
 
06:04:28.390 --> 06:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
there are State fin
 
06:04:31.110 --> 06:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
if you are not following uh the
 
06:04:33.868 --> 06:04:33.878 align:start position:0%
guidelines and also finally related back
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the lawsuits this statute would only
 
06:04:37.868 --> 06:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
protect you if you're following the
 
06:04:41.230 --> 06:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines so if that business was even
 
06:04:43.310 --> 06:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
with this law if that business isn't
 
06:04:44.910 --> 06:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
following the guidelines well then they
 
06:04:46.468 --> 06:04:46.478 align:start position:0%
don't benefit from the statute and they
 
06:04:51.350 --> 06:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:54.788 --> 06:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
protected thank you um representative
 
06:04:58.270 --> 06:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
Hopson has a question on leave yes I do
 
06:05:00.628 --> 06:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question can
 
06:05:03.708 --> 06:05:03.718 align:start position:0%
you explain to me where um Chambers of
 
06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
Commerce they they are not 501 c3s I
 
06:05:09.750 --> 06:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
think they are
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
50136 is that correct or yeah they're
 
06:05:16.110 --> 06:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
501 c6s yeah could you could you tell me
 
06:05:19.070 --> 06:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
um if if they would fall under these
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:26.310 --> 06:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
Provisions do you know yes let me I just
 
06:05:28.310 --> 06:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
want to make sure the L language is what
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
I believe it is yeah so um under this uh
 
06:05:34.830 --> 06:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
statute it says business meets an
 
06:05:37.150 --> 06:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
organization or enterprising entity
 
06:05:38.670 --> 06:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
engaged in commercial industrial
 
06:05:40.910 --> 06:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
professional activities uh businesses
 
06:05:43.910 --> 06:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
may be for-profit entities or nonprofit
 
06:05:46.990 --> 06:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
organizations uh 501 c6s are still
 
06:05:49.830 --> 06:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
considered nonprofits so they should be
 
06:05:52.830 --> 06:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
um able to qualify under this as well
 
06:05:55.190 --> 06:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much you're
 
06:05:59.230 --> 06:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you any further
 
06:06:03.230 --> 06:06:03.240 align:start position:0%

thank you so much uh I thought M Marissa
 
06:06:53.390 --> 06:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
Chase had put me on the speaker line for
 
06:06:54.708 --> 06:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association for
 
06:06:57.510 --> 06:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
justice I am a governor at large of the
 
06:07:00.070 --> 06:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
board so if you'd permit me a minute or
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
two I would that would be appreciated if
 
06:07:04.750 --> 06:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
not I understand
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay I I what I wanted to do was I I
 
06:07:09.390 --> 06:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank uh representative Miler
 
06:07:11.788 --> 06:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
for his question and to drill down on
 
06:07:13.310 --> 06:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
that a little bit his question to
 
06:07:15.548 --> 06:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
representative Pedra had to do with is
 
06:07:17.910 --> 06:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
there a definition of what negligence is
 
06:07:19.110 --> 06:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
and you heard a lot about you know
 
06:07:21.270 --> 06:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
reasonableness and whatnot let me make
 
06:07:24.190 --> 06:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
that even easier every Jury has received
 
06:07:26.150 --> 06:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
an instruction from the judge defining
 
06:07:28.430 --> 06:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
negligence and it appears in every
 
06:07:30.110 --> 06:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
appell at case in New Hampshire
 
06:07:32.868 --> 06:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
negligence is the failure to do what a
 
06:07:35.830 --> 06:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable person would do under the
 
06:07:38.670 --> 06:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances or doing something that a
 
06:07:40.590 --> 06:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable person or business would not
 
06:07:42.868 --> 06:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
do under the circumstances obviously
 
06:07:46.270 --> 06:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
that changes with the circumstances now
 
06:07:47.948 --> 06:07:47.958 align:start position:0%
based on that definition there are
 
06:07:50.670 --> 06:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
really two issues that that come out of
 
06:07:54.510 --> 06:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
that and come out of this bill one is
 
06:07:56.190 --> 06:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
the bill would send a mixed message
 
06:07:57.990 --> 06:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
about what's reason able and the other
 
06:08:00.030 --> 06:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
is it would create a race to the bottom
 
06:08:02.430 --> 06:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
mixed messages we have the CDC we have
 
06:08:04.910 --> 06:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
the governor we have our own Bureau for
 
06:08:07.628 --> 06:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Infectious Disease Control
 
06:08:09.548 --> 06:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
putting out guidelines telling
 
06:08:12.468 --> 06:08:12.478 align:start position:0%
businesses what to do in every Court in
 
06:08:14.948 --> 06:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
every case for bodily injury those
 
06:08:17.190 --> 06:08:17.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines would be the definition of
 
06:08:18.830 --> 06:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
what a reasonable business would do
 
06:08:21.190 --> 06:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances at the time
 
06:08:23.350 --> 06:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
those guidelines were in force that
 
06:08:25.030 --> 06:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
would be the definition of what's
 
06:08:27.190 --> 06:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable and therefore what's
 
06:08:29.910 --> 06:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
negligent this statute says oh but not
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
withstanding that as long as you're not
 
06:08:33.830 --> 06:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
grossly negligent you cannot be held
 
06:08:35.468 --> 06:08:35.478 align:start position:0%
liable so we're telling them the
 
06:08:37.070 --> 06:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
governor and the CDC are given them
 
06:08:39.150 --> 06:08:39.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines on one hand but on the other
 
06:08:41.468 --> 06:08:41.478 align:start position:0%
hand you don't have to comply with them
 
06:08:42.830 --> 06:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
because that's just negligence that's
 
06:08:44.708 --> 06:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
not gross negligence you can't be held
 
06:08:46.868 --> 06:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
responsible do we want to create a
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
system of mixed messages like that where
 
06:08:51.708 --> 06:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
the CDC guidance and our Bureau of
 
06:08:53.830 --> 06:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
infectious control guidance is basically
 
06:08:57.190 --> 06:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
a waste of time comined with that is the
 
06:08:59.350 --> 06:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
race to the bottom most of our
 
06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
businesses want to do the reasonable
 
06:09:04.788 --> 06:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
thing but there's always a cost of doing
 
06:09:06.990 --> 06:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
business of taking more reasonable
 
06:09:09.468 --> 06:09:09.478 align:start position:0%
precautions there's always going to be a
 
06:09:12.750 --> 06:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
motivation for some few businesses to
 
06:09:15.150 --> 06:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
save a few bucks by cutting back a
 
06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
little bit on some of those guidelines
 
06:09:18.670 --> 06:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
on some of the precautions they are
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
taking being not as careful as the CDC
 
06:09:23.628 --> 06:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
or the governor want them to be and
 
06:09:25.788 --> 06:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
guess what that puts them at a
 
06:09:27.830 --> 06:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
competitive advantage AG over the
 
06:09:29.910 --> 06:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable businesses reasonable
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
businesses feel the pressure to do the
 
06:09:34.030 --> 06:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
same thing and there's suddenly a race
 
06:09:36.150 --> 06:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of taking fewer and fer
 
06:09:38.510 --> 06:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
precautions so that they can pass on
 
06:09:40.750 --> 06:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
their their savings to their customers
 
06:09:42.788 --> 06:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
and keep their customers and keep their
 
06:09:44.788 --> 06:09:44.798 align:start position:0%
business and we would never get to the
 
06:09:46.230 --> 06:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
point where things are so bad that it's
 
06:09:48.350 --> 06:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
gross negligence that I could prove and
 
06:09:50.708 --> 06:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
pursue a case so those are just a couple

bill as I I stated in in the originally
 
06:11:50.030 --> 06:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is the Resurgence of an idea
 
06:11:53.110 --> 06:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
that began more than a year ago uh and
 
06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
came to us uh and uh
 
06:12:00.270 --> 06:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion should have passed at that
 
06:12:03.230 --> 06:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
time but it couldn't uh so it's been
 
06:12:05.948 --> 06:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
resurrected and it's a bill whose Time
 
06:12:07.868 --> 06:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
Has Come
 
06:12:11.390 --> 06:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's time for the citizens of New
 
06:12:14.708 --> 06:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have access uh to degrees
 
06:12:17.070 --> 06:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
from Signum
 
06:12:20.350 --> 06:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
University do the second care
 
06:12:24.628 --> 06:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
to offer any thank you um yes I would
 
06:12:28.070 --> 06:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
just add that uh uh this been kicking
 
06:12:31.708 --> 06:12:31.718 align:start position:0%
around for a year or so um we had
 
06:12:35.390 --> 06:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
testimony uh just the other day from uh
 
06:12:36.708 --> 06:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
Education Mr applebe that the higher
 
06:12:41.040 --> 06:12:45.230 align:start position:0%
Education Mr applebe that the higher
commission

06:12:45.230 --> 06:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:50.468 --> 06:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
has sign Signum um and the ball is now
 
06:12:55.468 --> 06:12:55.478 align:start position:0%
an artport the Signum has uh satisfied
 
06:13:00.628 --> 06:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh many if not all of the original 13
 
06:13:02.548 --> 06:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
items that they were to
 
06:13:06.430 --> 06:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
pursue um so I think that there is no
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
reason uh to not
 
06:13:13.590 --> 06:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
grant them we granting Authority and
 
06:13:14.990 --> 06:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
06:13:17.150 --> 06:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much is there
 
06:13:19.628 --> 06:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
any further
 
06:13:23.030 --> 06:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
discussion represent R uh thank you Mr
 
06:13:25.150 --> 06:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
chair I'm disappointed that this is
 
06:13:27.230 --> 06:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
coming before right now you had
 
06:13:30.150 --> 06:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
indicated in our last last committee
 
06:13:32.708 --> 06:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
meeting that you would uh consult with
 
06:13:35.510 --> 06:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
the elite ranking Dem for executive
 
06:13:37.628 --> 06:13:37.638 align:start position:0%
sessions this has not been uh I've been
 
06:13:40.270 --> 06:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
not consulted with on this at all so I'm
 
06:13:42.510 --> 06:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
disappointed Mr chair that you did not
 
06:13:44.548 --> 06:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
follow through on your commitment to do
 
06:13:47.430 --> 06:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
that in particular in relation to this
 
06:13:49.948 --> 06:13:49.958 align:start position:0%
particular bill this has been around for
 
06:13:52.390 --> 06:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
some time for a good reason and that is
 
06:13:55.150 --> 06:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
are serious questions about the veracity
 
06:13:57.708 --> 06:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
of this bill and the leadership of this
 
06:14:00.430 --> 06:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
University this in my nine years I have
 
06:14:03.030 --> 06:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
never been threatened by somebody who
 
06:14:05.230 --> 06:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
was trying to pursue a bill I've been
 
06:14:08.350 --> 06:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
lobbied no question about that but as uh
 
06:14:10.628 --> 06:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
we heard in the the last hearing that
 
06:14:13.070 --> 06:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
had this representative luno basically
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
read a letter in which the president of
 
06:14:19.830 --> 06:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
the College University I'll say college
 
06:14:19.840 --> 06:14:20.468 align:start position:0%
the College University I'll say college
uh

06:14:20.468 --> 06:14:20.478 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:22.910 --> 06:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
threatened directly Mr luno and
 
06:14:22.920 --> 06:14:24.390 align:start position:0%
threatened directly Mr luno and
indirectly

06:14:24.390 --> 06:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
indirectly
 
06:14:28.990 --> 06:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
me to me the veracity of doing that says
 
06:14:32.270 --> 06:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
something about the university and its
 
06:14:35.150 --> 06:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
integrity and on that and on on that
 
06:14:35.160 --> 06:14:36.708 align:start position:0%
integrity and on that and on on that
basis

06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
basis
 
06:14:39.948 --> 06:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
alone this should not go forward because
 
06:14:42.310 --> 06:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't think we need
 
06:14:44.910 --> 06:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
institutions of Higher Learning in this
 
06:14:47.708 --> 06:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
state that basically threaten
 
06:14:49.628 --> 06:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
Representatives because of their
 
06:14:52.110 --> 06:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
position on a particular bill I will be
 
06:14:55.110 --> 06:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
voting a strong no on this
 
06:14:56.948 --> 06:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you
 
06:14:59.628 --> 06:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much represent represent
 
06:15:03.750 --> 06:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
leas yes looking at that letter I am not
 
06:15:06.230 --> 06:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
sure how
 
06:15:09.868 --> 06:15:09.878 align:start position:0%
saying you have publicly printed things
 
06:15:12.830 --> 06:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
that um were Incorrect and rather than
 
06:15:14.670 --> 06:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
going to the Cress
 
06:15:18.830 --> 06:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
to uh reu these things that were printed
 
06:15:21.270 --> 06:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
I would like to meet with you in person
 
06:15:24.750 --> 06:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
to work this out so that you you know so
 
06:15:26.868 --> 06:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:15:28.990 --> 06:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to interject for a second here
 
06:15:31.430 --> 06:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
we are dealing with HB
 
06:15:34.310 --> 06:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
513 the authority of sign granting
 
06:15:36.788 --> 06:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
authority of singam University to be
 
06:15:39.830 --> 06:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
authorized by this legislature yes and I
 
06:15:41.788 --> 06:15:41.798 align:start position:0%
don't believe the discussion of where
 
06:15:44.150 --> 06:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're going has anything to do with the
 
06:15:47.110 --> 06:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
nature of the bill which simply says
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
approved by the higher education
 
06:15:50.430 --> 06:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
commission and
 
06:15:52.948 --> 06:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
authorized five those the only changes
 
06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
so let's stick to the content please I
 
06:15:58.948 --> 06:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
was just trying to say that I don't
 
06:16:00.948 --> 06:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
think that constitutes criminal
 
06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
threatening and therefore
 
06:16:06.548 --> 06:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't that has absolutely nothing to
 
06:16:09.868 --> 06:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
do with this content on this bill so
 
06:16:13.708 --> 06:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:17.990 --> 06:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
discussion yes rep wock thank you uh Mr
 
06:16:20.430 --> 06:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I had to dig out my file I
 
06:16:22.270 --> 06:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
was surprised this came up without any
 
06:16:23.510 --> 06:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
notice today at all even during the
 
06:16:25.788 --> 06:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
lunch break so we could prepare but that
 
06:16:30.390 --> 06:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
being said um I was inclined to support
 
06:16:34.510 --> 06:16:34.520 align:start position:0%
this uh bill I have been inclined last
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
year although I didn't because I thought
 
06:16:39.230 --> 06:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
the higher education and doe done their
 
06:16:41.708 --> 06:16:41.718 align:start position:0%
due diligence of course we saw all the
 
06:16:44.030 --> 06:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
the uh items that had not been corrected
 
06:16:47.070 --> 06:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
but supposedly are corrected now um but
 
06:16:50.670 --> 06:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
I became concerned last year uh as I am
 
06:16:53.230 --> 06:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
now when both times we asked the
 
06:16:56.190 --> 06:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
president of the University uh what he
 
06:16:59.390 --> 06:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
did with students who had paid their
 
06:17:02.150 --> 06:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
money uh for a program to get their
 
06:17:05.230 --> 06:17:05.240 align:start position:0%
masters uh and the University was not
 
06:17:08.628 --> 06:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
certified for that and as a matter of
 
06:17:10.868 --> 06:17:10.878 align:start position:0%
fact one of the speakers uh an eloquent
 
06:17:13.070 --> 06:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
speaker actually for in his favor came
 
06:17:15.230 --> 06:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
on both years and and said she got the
 
06:17:17.430 --> 06:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
degree and actually got her adjunct job
 
06:17:19.548 --> 06:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
because of that but at both times the
 
06:17:22.110 --> 06:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
school was not certified um to give
 
06:17:24.390 --> 06:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
degrees so I I feel like it's been a uh
 
06:17:25.830 --> 06:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
the first year I understand that we knew
 
06:17:27.948 --> 06:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
but last year knowing that they
 
06:17:31.590 --> 06:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
continued to take students money uh with
 
06:17:33.390 --> 06:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
the hope and assumption that they get a
 
06:17:36.190 --> 06:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
Ms uh for the course work and that that
 
06:17:38.830 --> 06:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
concerns me uh the other part that that
 
06:17:41.190 --> 06:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
that significantly concerns me actually
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I think it's kind of unfair on the
 
06:17:46.070 --> 06:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
other hand I guess if people are willing
 
06:17:47.350 --> 06:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
enough to know that they're going to pay
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
their money to take a tuition course and
 
06:17:51.708 --> 06:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
not have no valid it's their money they
 
06:17:54.030 --> 06:17:54.040 align:start position:0%

question as far as
 
06:20:29.708 --> 06:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
working with the ranking Democrat to
 
06:20:32.628 --> 06:20:32.638 align:start position:0%

06:20:34.910 --> 06:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
of issues that are going to come before
 
06:20:37.788 --> 06:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
this committee as far as exec sessions I
 
06:20:41.750 --> 06:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
have put in the calendar the exec
 
06:20:44.868 --> 06:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
sessions which are are set for next week
 
06:20:46.590 --> 06:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
and the following week I don't know if
 
06:20:48.310 --> 06:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's been published for the following
 
06:20:51.830 --> 06:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
week but that left only two that haven't
 
06:20:54.030 --> 06:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
been that won't be posted and that this
 
06:20:58.150 --> 06:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
is one of the two and yes we did we do
 
06:21:00.548 --> 06:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
notice in the calendar that exec session
 
06:21:04.510 --> 06:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
may follow uh any time during the the
 
06:21:08.230 --> 06:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
hearing process so um that that's the
 
06:21:11.030 --> 06:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
way this is happening today so your your
 
06:21:14.310 --> 06:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
your answer is no my answer is that we
 
06:21:16.390 --> 06:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
just did exactly what is in the calendar
 
06:21:19.430 --> 06:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
and allowed the by rules to occur so the
 
06:21:22.708 --> 06:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
answer is no thank you very
 
06:21:27.190 --> 06:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
much be minority rep Minority Report yes
 
06:21:29.548 --> 06:21:29.558 align:start position:0%
uh either representative luno or Miler
 
06:21:32.190 --> 06:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
would do that Minority Report thank
 
06:21:35.230 --> 06:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
you represent luno was not present at
 
06:21:37.910 --> 06:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
the vote then I will do it thank you
 
06:21:37.920 --> 06:21:38.670 align:start position:0%
the vote then I will do it thank you
you're

06:21:38.670 --> 06:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
you're
 
06:21:43.750 --> 06:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
welcome so that uh Mr Mr chairman yes
 
06:21:46.750 --> 06:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
just a point of clarification uh in the
 
06:21:48.830 --> 06:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
future if you're going to call an
 
06:21:50.990 --> 06:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
executive session and there is a lunch
 
06:21:53.150 --> 06:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
bake before that executive session could
 
06:21:54.948 --> 06:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
you at least give us the courtesy of
 
06:21:56.150 --> 06:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that
 
06:21:59.150 --> 06:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
so everyone have a chance to
 
06:22:01.510 --> 06:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
prepare instead of throwing on the last
 
06:22:04.350 --> 06:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
minute my advice is that after we have
 
06:22:04.360 --> 06:22:05.590 align:start position:0%
minute my advice is that after we have
hearings

06:22:05.590 --> 06:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
06:22:08.670 --> 06:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
it's you ought to be preparing for the
 
06:22:10.628 --> 06:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
exact session which can occur at any
 
06:22:13.350 --> 06:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
time however the exact sessions which we
 
06:22:15.868 --> 06:22:15.878 align:start position:0%
have scheduled in the calendar those
 
06:22:18.468 --> 06:22:18.478 align:start position:0%
exact sessions cannot occur prior to the
 
06:22:21.628 --> 06:22:21.638 align:start position:0%
scheduled times so I believe there's
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
only one bill left that we have heard
 
06:22:27.788 --> 06:22:27.798 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
06:22:29.910 --> 06:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
schedu that would yeah they just voted
 
06:22:32.468 --> 06:22:32.478 align:start position:0%
on Mr chair Mr chair I'm not concerned
 
06:22:33.708 --> 06:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
about the
 
06:22:36.430 --> 06:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
upep I'm just asking is the courtesy if
 
06:22:37.750 --> 06:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
you at least to notify us that you're
 
06:22:39.670 --> 06:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
going to do things at least if we have a
 
06:22:41.110 --> 06:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
break of lunch hour so we can compare
 
06:22:43.270 --> 06:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
