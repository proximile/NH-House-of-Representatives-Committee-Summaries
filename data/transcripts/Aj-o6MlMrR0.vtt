00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
inside the story and you're like oh wait
 
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
and um I'm not going to say I was
 
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
thoroughly convinced by the
 
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
representatives of the nhspca but I
 
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
think they did make some interesting
 
00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
points um some points that really made
 
00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
me uh it gave me pause about some things
 
00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
that there there's a concern that I have
 
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
and I think many other people have that
 
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
um that there's
 
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
people being violated at the hands of
 
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
the state and and but at the same time
 
00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
they're probably I'm assuming are a lot
 
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
of instances where there are animal
 
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
animal abuse or neglect cases where the
 
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
system is working excellently it's
 
00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 align:start position:0%
saving animals not necessarily from
 
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
people that are intending to do harm but
 
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
just they've just lost their ability to
 
00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
know what to do or take care of them and
 
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
so I I think one of my fears is I don't
 
00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
want to throw the baby out with the
 
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
bathat um I don't I think I think
 
00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 align:start position:0%
there's a a fine line that we're going
 
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
to have to walk with each one of the
 
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
little Parts because there's several
 
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
major parts in this bill and each one I
 
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
think may require some some thorough um
 
00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 align:start position:0%
thinking through um and um I I I'm
 
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the discussion
 
00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 align:start position:0%
because I I'm I hope that people aren't
 
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
um seeing this so black and white I
 
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
think that there's there's a lot of Gray
 
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
in here and I'm hoping that we can do
 
00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
something to protect people from ever
 
00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
being violated in the way that was
 
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
discussed with the Lee case and I'm not
 
00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
familiar with the Lee case myself so I
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't know what what's true and what's
 
00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
not but assuming that what was said was
 
00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
true I mean that's pretty horrible and I
 
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
think we should do what we can to stop
 
00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
that but I also don't want to throw the
 
00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 align:start position:0%
baby out with the bath water I I tend to
 
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
agree with you uh representative King
 
00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
however you know had I been able to ask
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions of um the folks that testified
 
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
I would have been very interested to
 
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
know for all the reports where the ASPCA
 
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
comes out to investigate how many of
 
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
them have they walked away from and said
 
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
no there's not a problem here um I just
 
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
tend to think that there is
 
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
um perhaps an overzealousness on their
 
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
part um I only because I feel like in a
 
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
sense they have an
 
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
interest not only in
 
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
Humane areas but they have an interest
 
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
financially in um
 
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 align:start position:0%
in taking animals away from people and
 
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict there that I see and
 
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
I think that that's something that
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
really needs to be teased out and
 
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
discussed and and for us to fix because
 
00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
um it's a problem and this is something
 
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
that is not um just being seen in New
 
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh when I went to the state
 
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
agricultural uh uh and Rural leadership
 
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
conference this uh past couple of months
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
ago these this kind of thing is
 
00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
happening all over the country from
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
these animal activists or Animal Humane
 
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
Societies whatever they they have been
 
00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
harassing Farmers they have been
 
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
targeting farmers and um you know they
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
they have a certain set of beliefs where
 
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
they don't feel animals should be
 
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
working they don't feel that um Farmers
 
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
should own animals or or or um you know
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
produce milk or produce meat or whatever
 
00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
and they will do whatever is necessary
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
to shut them down so I I you
 
00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
know that's okay they can have their
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
opinion and they can have their way of
 
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
doing things but I I don't think that
 
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.030 align:start position:0%
doing things but I I don't think that
that

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
zealousness um should be allowed to
 
00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
disrupt and and put strike fear in the
 
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
in the heart of the people who are
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
producing food for us um so we have to
 
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 align:start position:0%
we have to figure it out represent Bixby
 
00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
yeah I um to some degree I share your
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
concern in terms of the uh the Humane
 
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
organizations and the steps they take I
 
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
think that what has what we saw in Lee
 
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
was clearly not done correctly right
 
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
however I am also hesitant to paint them
 
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
with a broad brush with having a um you
 
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
fundamentally anti-
 
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
agriculture um bias I I think that I I'm
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
you that may be out there in some cases
 
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
I but I don't want to paint with paint
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
with a broad brush and I I don't see
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
that as being a primary motivator in New
 
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh which it doesn't mean that
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
it isn't there at some level somewhere
 
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
but uh I don't think that I don't think
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
that what we're hearing from you know
 
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
other larger um agricultural states that
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
have a different Dynamic is necessarily
 
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
entirely applicable to what we're doing
 
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
and uh and I so I don't think that
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
should be you know the way that I don't
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
think that it makes sense for that to
 
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
guide what we do here right now uh I
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
but um one of the things that uh well I
 
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
don't know how there there are a number
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
of details that that need to be
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
addressed okay uh one thing that
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that I don't I don't see
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
in the bill is uh the um is a
 
00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
clear a method of U letting the anim the
 
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
animal known owner know all of their
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
rights so uh we do have the
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh have uh one line in there about uh
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
the person charged he'll be aware of the
 
00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
PTI the ability to make the petition but
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
um what I'm concerned about in the Lee
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
case is
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
that uh the owner was led to give up
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
ownership of her animals in in a way
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
that she was not aware that she was
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
doing that absolutely and and there
 
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be uh clear there needs to be
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
something very
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
clear so that the owner of the animal is
 
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
fully aware that if they say yes in this
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
instance they are giving up ownership
 
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
yep uh and so that's something I think
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
we we need to add
 
00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 align:start position:0%
um so uh okay absolutely I I'm
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely in agreement representative
 
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
Kenny thank you um the one thing that I
 
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
didn't uh think of or ask yesterday was
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
um why in a couple of months did they
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
offer Donna to buy her goats back for
 
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
$40,000 what changed at her facility her
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
farm that would have allowed that and
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
they also wanted to sell her back one of
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
her goats at 400 $0000 that she just
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
purchased so I really wondered what
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
where did that figure come from
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
$40,000 in what changed that they could
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
have allowed those goats back to the
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
farm that's a good point representative
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
H Haskins thank you madam chair it won't
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
surprise anyone that my sympathies are
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
entirely with Miss Woods I think she was
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
treated abominably
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
and I was shrined that the SPCA
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
organization which I have supported in
 
00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
the past um felt that nothing was done
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
wrong they wouldn't do anything
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
differently and that I was appalled by
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
that um I had heard about this case I
 
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
did not know the details talk about
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
impugning motives I think that was all
 
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
over this case and almost implied that
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
you know people owners can be mentally
 
00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.230 align:start position:0%
you know people owners can be mentally
ill

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
ill
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
and a colleague and I talked about the
 
00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:35.039 align:start position:0%
fact that she happens to be a senior
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
citizen and I think she was prayed upon
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
I think there was no way she was uh
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
supported enabled with the kind of
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
information that would be necessary to
 
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
stand up to what was happening and I
 
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
also think there's almost a dichotomy
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
between law enforcement and Humane
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
treatment law enforcement is trained in
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
a certain way for a certain job and when
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
it comes down to it we we rely on that I
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't think that it was used properly in
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
this case and and what representative
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
Kenny said is so bothersome
 
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
so obviously the bill is going to be
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
amended in ways but I don't think the
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
other side clothed themselves in glory
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday thank you representative
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
Barber yes I had a question to um can
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
you explain to me um if there is in fact
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
that Financial tie between the state and
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
the NH um SPCA I mean what do they have
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
to gain why are they our primary go-to
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
for this type of case I'm unfamiliar
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
represent big thank you yeah so um I
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't know the full history of it uh uh
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper might know a little
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
bit more but uh the
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues in terms of uh
 
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
animal investigations is that they're
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
complicated and expensive and uh the I
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
think the idea of having uh the Humane
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
Societies essentially
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
deputized uh came up whenever whenever
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
that ended up in law I suspect that it
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
was a way of saving State money by uh
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
having some private organization that it
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
could be delegated to but uh from what I
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
see in statute there is no
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
oversight uh and so there's not there's
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
not a direct payment to the Humane
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
Societies uh but there is a um but there
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
is a umire for desire for them to to to
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
take on some of the work that the
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
state's not willing to pay for I I see
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh U commissioner raising his hand would
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
thoughts thank you there is absolutely
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
no relationship between the state in any
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
Humane organ Humane Society we regulate
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
them we
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
inspect what has happened in
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in in this case I mean
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
there was that confusing language left
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
when last the statute was amended and I
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't know when it was that left the
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
officer of Humane organization or
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
whatever it is in there which hopefully
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
will be taken out and that was only for
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
protective custody made no sense to have
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
left it there but we all know how things
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
work with with legislation but we never
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
recommend to any um any police Police
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
Department any specific organization to
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
take custody in this particular case
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
this was totally instigated by the
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
humane society and then they directly
 
00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
worked with the police and the state had
 
00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact my inspectors were
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
so uncomfortable with what was going on
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
they called the state veterinarian said
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
nobody's asking us for advice we didn't
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
have the right to inject our opinions
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
and so they said we're so uncomfortable
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
can we leave yeah and they were given
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
the permission to leave um you
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
know so there is a you know there is
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
some tension frankly between the
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture and the new
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
Humane Society of New Hampshire um and
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
so that's not a place that we have
 
00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
actually in my tenure have um
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
recommended that anybody come in we do
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
give um
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
a number of names when horses are seized
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
when livestock is seized you might want
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
to call ABCD to see if they have space
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
and but we'd never make the calls on
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
their behalfs we might call someplace
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
and say do you have space available for
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
this type of animal and then we would
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
say to the police you know again here's
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
the list and we happen to know um that
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
this organization or you know sometimes
 
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
it could even be for horse it could be
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh the University of New Hampshire it's
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
a call to see if they have spaces in
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
their Stables if the animals don't have
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
disease so you know we do try to work to
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
help the police because we do understand
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
that they don't know necessarily who to
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
turn to but we do not have a
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
relationship with any
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
organization anybody have any questions
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative Howard and then
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair this is it
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
actually directly for the commissioner
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
so I can wait if if people have
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
questions directly for him yeah you may
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
ask okay um so I'm this whole thing I'm
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
very very confused by the whole story
 
00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079 align:start position:0%
and the whole bill I think that there it
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
appears to me that there are a bunch of
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
steps missing you know like like
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
identifying expertise in in a particular
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
kind of animal it sounds like some of
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
the decisions about these goats were
 
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
made by people who don't know enough
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
about goats um and and the step between
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
the person who observed who for who was
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
not an official in any way just was on
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
the farm observed what she thought was a
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
problem goes directly instead of talking
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know trying to learn more about it
 
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
or something goes directly to the
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
authorities and and then the authorities
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
seem to take a large leap too so so I
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
think that if there's any way in the
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
legislation to to insert steps that that
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
clarify it because to me the whole thing
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
was just I couldn't understand I
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand it from beginning to
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
end from the story of the of the farm to
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
the uh steps taken by the
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
SPCA thank you representative
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you and good morning
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
um an amazing and sad tale that we heard
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
and I think we really should do
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
something about this uh I was going back
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
to the uh testimony given by the SPCA uh
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
specifically the uh Humane agent and I'm
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable with the idea that
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
that without a third party training and
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
certification program that that person
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
is any more qualified to make a decision
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
regarding an animal than than a police
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
officer who shows up so if absent that I
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
think they should be struck from the
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
ability to start taking animals uh I'm
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
also the issue of
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
them it being owner for somebody to
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
provide written notification of a
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
person's rights I I also reject that
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
argument I mean the police drive around
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
with their ticket books they also
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
usually have their binders and folders
 
00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
you can slide one of those in there and
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
it can be available when uh the
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
situation calls for it especially if
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a planned visit that
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
could be uh done by the police I don't
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
think that's honorous I do have one
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
other concern and that is that we are
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with living things and if they
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
are confiscated for a later trial for
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty or something um I think
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
it's very important to establish the
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
Baseline line of the condition of the
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
animals at the moment of confiscation
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
because if they're held for two weeks
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
and they don't receive the correct
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
treatment especially if they're already
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
have an illness to being treated for if
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
you look at the animal two weeks later
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
they'll look a lot worse than it did
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
when it was taken so I think I I just
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
think we have to make sure that when
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
they are especially if they're going to
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
uh pursue a criminal action that we're
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
very clear that the uh conditions of the
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
animals have to be established right up
 
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639 align:start position:0%
front um for any subsequent trial and if
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
I I have one other thought if I may I'm
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is also um an
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to start to use the
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
improvements in technology and um allow
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
some type of uh teleconferencing with a
 
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:17.079 align:start position:0%
Veterinary a qualified Veterinary I mean
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
you know people have their their cameras
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
now and if you if the person can't be
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
there in person because of uh staff
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
limitations even to have them on the
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
line and with the with the camera so
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
that the vet can ask the right question
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
show me this part of the animal um it
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
might be a good to put that option into
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
this bill to increase the chances that
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have a qualified person making
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
that decision when the decision needs to
 
00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:42.390 align:start position:0%
that decision when the decision needs to
be

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
made represent Bixby yeah I um I I agree
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
with a lot of what you say I'm not sure
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
about the T the telea health uh aspect
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
of it because uh it's um one of the
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
there are some aspects of uh being able
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
to assess the entire context that could
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
really get missed and uh someone who's
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
holding that camera could be holding it
 
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:09.950 align:start position:0%
holding that camera could be holding it
very

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
selectively uh so um I I would hesitate
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
to say that um the uh that um just doing
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
it by by a you know by a remote vision
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient to really assess the
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
situ situation however I entirely agree
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
that uh the there needs to be a third-
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
party person who is not associated with
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
either the um the accused or with the uh
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
investigating um or or with a
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
complainant that can assess what the
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
context is and what the uh and what the
 
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
condition of the animals are is I I have
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
a question actually for our commissioner
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
world do you think it would be
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have a I don't know a
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
special office within the state
 
00:19:15.799 --> 00:19:17.390 align:start position:0%
special office within the state
veterinarians

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
veterinarians
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
Department uh who could sort of be a a
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
task force or be on call or uh be
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions either by
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
phone or if they could be called out to
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
a a report um in a perfect world if
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
there was enough money to go around if
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
there was whatever do you think it would
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to have that kind of
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
resource within the Department of
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
Agriculture I'm not sure that that would
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
be even in a perfect world if that would
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
be coste effective because of the the
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
few cases that we have although there
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
you know maybe one one a month um I
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
think you know Ely what we need is more
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
more Staffing in the department to do
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
the overall mission what I will you know
 
00:20:08.789 --> 00:20:08.799 align:start position:0%
will say is that you know there's this
 
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
case and there's a couple where I don't
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
believe the law was really followed the
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
way it should have been because you got
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
to step step back and I know that
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
protective custody is what again what
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
people think was being used here I think
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
there are fixes here that take care of
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
that so that will largely go away if you
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
look at the conf
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
a there needs to be that assessment and
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
the assessments are done um largely from
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
the property line or from statements of
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
people who are allowed on the property
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
because remember we can't go trespass we
 
00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
can't just go in and say we want to look
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
at your animals and that was part of the
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
problem that went on in the Lee
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
situation as they came in as we want to
 
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
help you we want to you know Assist you
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
um and that really wasn't what went on
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
but in most cases you're going to have
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
the the court order and so now the
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
police department when are handling it
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
correctly are going to reach out to us
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
and we are going to coordinate with them
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
when we go to issue the uh
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
actual um yeah the actual court order so
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to be with the police uh
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
staff from my office is going to be
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
there doing an evaluation of the animals
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
on site at that time and then if the
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
police follow our recommendations things
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
tend to go
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
well sometimes the problem is and this
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
is part of the the issue of not having a
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
cost of care in in the past where we
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
wanted all of the horses in a situation
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
seized they were afraid of the cost
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
being the town so for weeks and weeks we
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
kept going back we kept watching the
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
animals they didn't see deterior
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
until I finally told that Police
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
Department I was not sending any people
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
there anymore because what you were
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
doing to my people was cruel and unusual
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
punishment essentially because they were
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
watching animals just get worse and
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
worse um but when they follow our
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations and say yes these are
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
the animals that we believe should be
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
seized things go go well and things um
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
are not terrible there's these couple of
 
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.950 align:start position:0%
are not terrible there's these couple of
outliers

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
outliers
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
um and and I think the bill addresses um
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
most of those if not all of them um I
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
have some suggestions to to make the
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
bill better that I gave to your your
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um but you know there is
 
00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
definitely a problem here but it's
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
generally when the agencies do not
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
consult with the Department prior and
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
again you know we get back to Staffing
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
level and not every case requires
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
requires that but there aren't that many
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
seizures of large animals representative
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah I'm just looking at the clock
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
and we have a hearing coming up at 10:
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh and uh I this is extremely
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
complicated we're not going to get it
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
solved this morning uh even if we you
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
know just blew through to worked till
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
noon uh so I think this might need to go
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh and uh have some have a
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
chance for some more thorough work okay
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
I think that's a um a a good um
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion um let's see who is on
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee all right hold
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
on um let's see the animal protection
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
and Licensing committee subcommittee
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay so uh representative Kat chairs
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
that we have representative Kenny
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
Freeman H Haskins and
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
suus so um I will consult with them uh
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
with at least representative kto if I
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
can get a hold of her I know she's had a
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
death in the family but um we'll see
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
what we can do and if she's not
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
available we'll we'll have someone else
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
who can share that and as a um as a
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
reminder uh everyone on the committee is
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
welcome to go to the subcommittee
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
hearing and participate fully except for
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
it except for voting so um right so I I
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
think that this is not trying to exclude
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
anybody this is just trying to move it
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
to a more efficient venue yes um I I
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
would like to try and maybe arrange
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
something that we can do either Friday
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
this Friday or Monday because time is of
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
the essence now we're kind of getting
 
00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
you know bearing down on uh on our March
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
20th uh date of getting all our bills
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
out and um yeah bill is going to need a
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of work and uh it also takes
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
time to draft it through o El
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative King uh question so I
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
think based on what I've heard so far it
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a lot of support
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
within the committee for this bill but
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot of work that needs to
 
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
be done if the subcommittee is not
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
really able
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
to uh fix it all before our end date um
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
would it be amendable to um the chair
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill and then work on it
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
over the summer and then come back with
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
something that really is solid or do you
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
feel that it needs to be done now I I
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be done now yeah I
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
don't want to wait another year and um I
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
think that you know we have enough
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
information right now to make uh
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
substantial changes to the bill well you
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
know the changes that we have discussed
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
and points that were brought up during
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and so forth um some of the
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
more minor
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
points will have to be discussed in the
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee but I'm going to uh
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of days work on the
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
changes that are we know that we want to
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
make and some of the other things will
 
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
just have to be discussed in the
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative Bixby yeah
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
so uh another possibility might be I
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
there are clearly some things that need
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
to happen right away uh there are other
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
things that could perhaps be um done at
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
you know uh on a long longer time scale
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh it might be possible to add a section
 
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
to the bill that creates a study
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
committee to study the entire chapter
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
and make further recommendations about
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
it rather than uh than just these
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
isolated points that's a very good point
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
thank you okay with that I'm going
 
00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:55.149 align:start position:0%
thank you okay with that I'm going
to

00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
yeah get my magic gabble out um for the
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
next for the hearing um so with that I'm
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
going to end our work session for this
 
00:27:03.279 --> 00:27:04.630 align:start position:0%
going to end our work session for this
particular

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%

bodies to regulate the musling of dogs
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%

thanks to the committee uh for giving me
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
your time and attention today my name is
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
jod n and I rep I represent the good
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
folks of cheser 4 over there in Keen
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
this particular piece of legislation um
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
is a simple and straightforward tweak
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
enabling local governing bodies to
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
regulate musling requirements for dogs
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
licensed in that municipality as you
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
know we are a Dylan's rule state and so
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
of course Authority must be expressly
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
granted to localities in order for them
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
to do this a few months back our city
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
council um in Keen attempted to do the
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
right thing in responding to a serious
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
concern from a constituent after a
 
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
tragic encounter with a known aggressive
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
dog in order to provide for the safety
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the broader community of people and
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
also our fur babies um the Keen city
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
leaders proposed that demonstrably
 
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
aggressive dogs be required to wear a
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
protective muzzle when in public I want
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
to also take this opportunity uh to
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that this is not only in
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
the interest of the broader public but
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
also the aggressive animal and their
 
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
owners as well um as allowing this dog
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
to be put in situations for whatever
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
reason um that for whatever reason have
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
proven to elicit dangerous and seemingly
 
00:30:59.789 --> 00:30:59.799 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable behavior is likely is
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
like playing Russian roulette the most
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
Humane solution in this situation is a
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
preventative one unfortunately in site
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
of in spite of their good intentions
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
according to the law this was not under
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
the council's uh purview so it's up to
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
us to pass legislation that will allow
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
the city to implement a reasonable and
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
effective solution my bill today very
 
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
simply allows them to do the right thing
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
for their constituents and with that um
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
if it's okay with you I need to SK
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
skattle to get to executive committee in
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
my own session but I would really like
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
to pass it off next um to Deb to share
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
the story that inspired what we are
 
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
informally in affectionately calling
 
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.789 align:start position:0%
informally in affectionately calling
suzette's

00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
suzette's
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
law okay thank you who who did you say
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
dog's jaw off of her leg
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
um come to find out uh the police
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
department told me uh which I did report
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
immediately of course um that uh the dog
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
that attacked my dog had an aggressive
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
history and had a couple of months
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
before um had mauled another dog uh
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
during a downtown uh Pride Fest
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
event um if the uh Community had
 
00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
been aware or allowed to order the owner
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
to muzzle that dog my dog or any other
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
dog would not have been attacked um and
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
it was a preventable solution so so I
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
would request you strongly consider the
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
fact that when dogs have a vicious dog
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
or pardon me when people have a vicious
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
dog or a dog with a bite history that
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
when they bring that dog into public
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
wear a preventative
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
muzzle thank you okay questions from the
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
committee oh representative King thank
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for your
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
testimony today um I think I would have
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
asked this question of the sponsor but
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I couldn't um but in your
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
case was the dog um like brought out by
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
the owner or did it escape a fenc yard
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
or was it always allowed to ro free I'm
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
just curious what the what the situation
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
was with that dog being out on the loose
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
at that time sure the dog was not loose
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh we were walking on a sidewalk and the
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
owner uh did have a leash on the dog he
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
had his head turned and was bagging uh
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
feces and I think think his attention
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
was not on the dog and the dog broke
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
away okay and we were on a public road
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
welcome um represent
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
Howard um I had a similar experience
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
with with a dog that I was watching and
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
um the the dog that attacked it was his
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
second attack and um he was deemed a
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
vicious dog and would have been put down
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
on the third
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know the police told us that he'd be
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
put down on his third offense so he's
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
now tied up he's he's a good dog but um
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
it seems like musling is a is a superior
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
um alternative to life-threatening
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
punishment would you agree agreed it's a
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
alternative okay any other questions
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
committee and did uh I have a question
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
did you I know you said you called this
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
in as a report to the
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
police did you speak to anyone else um
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
from the state or the Department of
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
Agriculture or
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
anybody I did speak before uh the city
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
council in Kean in Keen yes so were were
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen or the I don't know what
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
they're in Keen what they are did do
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
they have like an animal control officer
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
that knew about this
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
dog there was no Animal control officer
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
in Keen at the time which did compound
 
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
in Keen at the time which did compound
the

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
problem do you feel that uh if they had
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
had an animal control
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
officer uh that maybe something would
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
have done been done about the dog the
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
dog owner or the
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
dog um I was informed by the officer
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
that was working uh with me on the case
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
that the uh owner was uh contacted and
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
the dog was
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
quarantined um subsequently um I don't
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
walk in that area of the neighborhood
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
anymore I'm now fearful um and the dog
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
has been aggressive to other dogs but
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
this owner continues to take that dog
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
out on public
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
sidewalks okay but because there's no
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
Authority for the police to say you need
 
00:36:59.230 --> 00:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
to muzzle the dog if you take it out
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
so but the dog is is on a leash and is
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
under the control of the person well it
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
was on a leash and under the control of
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
that person at the time of the incident
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
okay um I I believe that there there are
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
some statutes having to do with um
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
vicious dogs or whatever represent Bixby
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes to find that uh just if we look at
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
the bill uh the existing language is
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
that the local governing body may make
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
such additional laws and regulations
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
concerning the licensing and restraining
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
of dogs as it deems reasonable and
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh apparently the city's
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
Council uh made the um assessment that
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
musling was not uh covered by
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
that because uh that musling would not
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
be strictly would would not fit into the
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
the definition of of
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
restraining um that's you know I I can't
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
speak to what the what the you know that
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
decision by the city's Council but um I
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh it probably I if if that
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
is a gray area I don't see a problem in
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
in fixing
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
it okay well um thank you I appreciate
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%

the city of Kean at this point feel as

if this um that we need this kind of
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
like enabling legislation um to be able
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%

rabies treatments
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
um it was a difficult time and this uh
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
owner of the other dog is not a
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
responsible owner and well known to the
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
police department
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
as being a aggressive person and I
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want to pursue it I was
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
fearful um I didn't want to go out in
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
public um it
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
and now when I go out in public on the
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
sidewalks I'm always looking for other
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
dogs and I'm wondering are they vicious
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
are they going to bite us um and I never
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
thought of that before the incident um I
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
love dogs I've always had dogs um and
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
now I think a a responsible owner if
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
their dog has a bite history really
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
should put a muzzle on their dogs if
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
they continue to take them out in public
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
areas because this was all happened on a
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
sidewalk on a very public
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
Street yeah there's
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
um there's two local um local um
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
constituents that have come to me
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
recently this is in actually some of it
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
was during election time um one of them
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
was actually um attacked by a dog um not
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
on a leash and nothing has been done um
 
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
ripped the whole back of her leg so I
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
just um I haven't really um spent time
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
on this and hearing now this another
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
story here that there just doesn't seem
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
to be a um even a legal pathway that
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
these things are taken care of um it's
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's quite concerning so thank you for
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony and I'm sorry what took
 
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:49.720 align:start position:0%
place thank you very much I appreciate
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
that um so I I do see that we have in
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
statute um musling and restraining
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
dogs and that there are penalties for
 
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.270 align:start position:0%
dogs and that there are penalties for
vicious

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
vicious
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
offense um $100 for first vicious
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
offense $400 for second or subsequent
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
vicious offense was anybody fined in
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
this uh in this attack that happened I
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
was told that the owner was fined
 
00:42:22.349 --> 00:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
um not to be flip but the dog doesn't
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
care if it gets fined or not it's still
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
going to bite the next dog or the next
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
person that's going by if they have a
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
bike history um that's the bottom
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
line representive King thank you again
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
Madam chair um one more question yes um
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
let's say this bill were to get passed
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
and municipalities have the authority
 
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
now to muzzle dogs um it it sounds good
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
the idea of muzzling that dog but would
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
you feel comfortable having your dog
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
muzzled as well and all dogs being
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
muzzled because I'm not sure how the
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
municipality would would create
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
something that would only muzzle the bad
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
dogs you
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
know well dogs that have a reported bite
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
history okay so you in your idea in your
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
ideal the the M municipalities would
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
create regulations for only dogs um that
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
have a bite history to be muzzled right
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
okay I don't mean to have every dog
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
muzzled in public but if you have a
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
known aggressive dog y yep okay but just
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
so just so we're aware I think if if I
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly this might allow
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity for a municipality
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
to muzzle all dogs that that is that you
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
don't think that would happen Okay no
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
Okay I do not I don't think that's
 
00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.390 align:start position:0%
Okay I do not I don't think that's
necessary

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
but so so the whole premise is that if
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
that dog had been muzzled because it
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
already had a bite history it would have
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
been prevented and that and that's my
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
take on it representative Howard thank
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um so in this in that
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
scenario who is keeping track of the
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
vicious dogs is where is the database
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
that that would keep track of dogs that
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
need to be muzzled well I would assume
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
the Animal control officer so you have
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%

uh first I'd like to thank
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
the commission leader a chairperson and
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for allowing me
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
to expect my opinion I'm representing
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
myself my name is Daniel doam I live in
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
the town of gilmont and I've been a
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
resident of bellnap County all my life
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
which is 81 years
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh there was a house in the dog in the
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
house when I was born and there'll be
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
one in the house when I
 
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
pass uh I own hunting dogs hting
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
dogs and uh house pets if you want to
 
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
say that this thing is kind of vague to
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
me a lot of
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
it um comes to morals ethics common
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
sense and you can't legislate that but
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know nothing is said about
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs herting dogs you can't have
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs wearing muzzles in the
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
woods they're just going to get caught
 
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.430 align:start position:0%
woods they're just going to get caught
up

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
and uh you know it's going to be a
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
disaster certain muzzles don't allow
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
them to back a hunting dog needs to
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
bark um same with
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
hering they don't need to necessarily
 
00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:20.390 align:start position:0%
hering they don't need to necessarily
bite

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
bite
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
livestock uh especially sheep but with
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
cattle sometimes you have an honor
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
animal and a little nip will
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
get them going but they can't do this
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
with muzzles on
 
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
so without you know the way it's worded
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
I I'm just cuz I'm afraid how it's going
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
to come out but it also would seem to me
 
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh if you had to regulate
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
this uh I don't know how you in a
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
municipality or whatever that it would
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
be Statewide just like the leash laws
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
not each town or what whatever different
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm opposed to as written and as I
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
said because of being H having hunting
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
dogs hurting dogs and just a dog around
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
the I live in the country I don't have a
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
neighbor in sight of my house I like
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
having a
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
watchdog and one that isn't necessarily
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
muzzled he can't do his job if he's
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
muzzled as far as hurting it's when you
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
got sheep and
 
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
cattle uh the biggest problems they have
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
is during lambing time or cing time and
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
with coyotes
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
Predators uh a hurting dog can't do his
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
thing if he's
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
muzzled and I guess that's all I got to
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
say and I'll try to answer anybody's
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions if they have
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
them uh do you think that a a
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
um do you think that a a a hurting dog
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
or a hunting
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
dog that a city council might want to
 
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.069 align:start position:0%
dog that a city council might want to
muzzle

00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
muzzle
 
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
them I'm not sure I don't how this is
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know all going to play out but uh I
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
have my fears and I'd want to see a
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
better description of you know the law
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
before I would support
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you representa H Haskins
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you Mr
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
dockham for coming today to testify we
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your presence here would you
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
be more comfortable with the bill if it
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
expressly said that having once bitten
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
another animal or a person that they
 
00:48:47.069 --> 00:48:47.079 align:start position:0%
should be muzzled if they're on a
 
00:48:47.079 --> 00:48:48.710 align:start position:0%
should be muzzled if they're on a
public

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
sidewalk no not no in public as what
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
happened to this unfortunate situation
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
but you know I I don't think there's
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
anything in there that exempts hunting
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
dogs or herting dogs and uh so therefore
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know that would be my main
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
opposition so the Once Bitten part sorry
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
follow up Madam chair oh yes sure the
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
Once Bitten part doesn't reach you
 
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
as no uh as I said I've had dogs all my
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
life both hunting and herting I've never
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
had one that was ugly with people yeah I
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't personally keep an ugly dog all
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
right my house dog and what I call Watch
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
Dog would probably not bite anyone but
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
surely would you know try to deter them
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
and they're a deterrent yes for for that
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
type of thing but I I I guess I could
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
say the cattle dog I got now if somebody
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
started to grab me or rough housee me
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
that dog would intervene but otherwise
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
it would not sure
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
understood thank
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you um represent Scully
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
um grber I'm sorry would you like to
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
take your seat uh representative Howard
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
you had a question yes thank you madam
 
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
chair so so it would be more clear to
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
you or it would feel more um more
 
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate to to classify it by
 
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions of of certain types of dogs
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
rather than to speci specify dogs that
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
had already been deemed a
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
danger right well I I you know of course
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs and hurting dogs really
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
aren't out in the
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
public but I still would like to see
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
some kind of wording to that effect I
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
mean if it has I don't know how you
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
would word it any municipality or
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
whatever uh they had to be muzzled that
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't bother me I don't take my
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs to town my hurting dogs
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
either so but you know uh to me the way
 
00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:55.109 align:start position:0%
either so but you know uh to me the way
it's

00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
written uh could be being up to any kind
 
00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.670 align:start position:0%
written uh could be being up to any kind
of

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation okay any other
 
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
questions yes seeing uh representative
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
miby so just as a clarification of the
 
00:51:11.309 --> 00:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
way that the bill Works uh there are
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
certain powers that the state reserves
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
to itself in fact Mo s the powers of law
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
are reserved by the state unless they're
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
directly granted to
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
communities and which means that the
 
00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
issue here is that without our giving uh
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities permission they can't
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
make any rules about
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
musling uh what this bill would be doing
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
is just giving towns the permission to
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
do that and then if your town were to uh
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
create an ordinance you would have have
 
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh participate in
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
your Town's decision about creating that
 
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.589 align:start position:0%
your Town's decision about creating that
or

00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance so uh does that change your
 
00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.390 align:start position:0%
ordinance so uh does that change your
your

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
um feeling about the bill no I think
 
00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
that it should be like the leash laws
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
okay and otherw
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide okay thank you okay any other
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir for coming this
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%

sure uh the next person to come speak is
Bobby

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
Bobby
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
Williams good morning Mr Williams
 
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
agriculture hello thank you for having
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
me um my name is Bobby Williams I'm a
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
city counselor on the Keane city council
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
so um after uh Deb's dog suffered this
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunate attack she came to me um to
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
ask that the city do something about uh
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
vicious dogs that had a record of
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
attacking other dogs and so um I I did
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
bring it uh as a suggested ordinance to
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
the city council and um when we were in
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
committee um you know there was a lot of
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
positive feedback on the idea but um the
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
um that uh there was just a Twist in the
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
way the law was written that that meant
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
that we weren't not empowered to to do
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
um do this musling and that is that um
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
you know uh representative Bixby uh
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um that there is you know
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
existing existing language about
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
restraining drugs and and one would
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
think and I thought at the time that
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
that would apply to musling um however
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
since there's another section of the law
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
um that talks about a rabies outbreak
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
and says that in the event of a rabies
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
outbreak um municipalities can order
 
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
dogs to be muzzled um because that
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
section of law talks about musling um it
 
00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
was assumed that um you know that was
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
what we were allowed to do for musling
 
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
and that that uh superseded um the law
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
about restraining in the other section
 
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
of the law so um I don't think it was
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
ever intentionally written to uh exclude
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
the uh you know a municipality's um
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
ability to use musling as a restraint
 
00:54:26.789 --> 00:54:26.799 align:start position:0%
but because this other section of the
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
law regarding rabies um came in um that
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
changed the meaning such that we were
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
not able to um pass an ordinance to uh
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
address um you know this concern that a
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
lot of people have expressed about um
 
00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
dogs that have a history of of attacking
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
other dogs in public um we did
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
subsequently you know looking for what
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
we could do um there
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
were uh you know some finds that that we
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
we raised the fine for a a vicious a
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
vicious dog um attacking another we
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
raised that uh from from $50 to the
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
maximum of $100 um I don't really feel
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
that that's an effective way to prevent
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing um but it was it was
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
what we were able to do um and so we you
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
know we kind of feel like um you know
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
being being a city we should we should
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
be empowered to protect the public
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
safety of our citizens and that this
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
this is preventing us from doing that
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
and so um you all have a letter on your
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
desk from our mayor um that expresses uh
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
you know it was a unanimous vote uh by
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
the city council to send you this letter
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
expressing support for for this measure
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
so um with that um having explained uh
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
represent happened thank you madam chair
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming today um you
 
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
might be the exact person to talk to on
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
this issue um you we just heard from the
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
previous testifier that there's some
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
fear that um the the the the law might
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
be too broad and then a city could
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
create an ordinance that's too broad and
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
next thing you know you're affecting
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
people that live out in the country and
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
their hunting dogs and their guard dogs
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that um can you explain
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
to us how you would create uh create or
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
craft an ordinance that would help to
 
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
address the issue at hand without being
 
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.910 align:start position:0%
address the issue at hand without being
overly

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
overly
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
broad um
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you that that's a good question uh
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
first of all um we would we would make
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the ordinance apply to dogs that
 
00:56:37.029 --> 00:56:37.039 align:start position:0%
are in public so if your dog is on
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
private hunting land um you know this
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply uh second
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't really want to
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
make this uh a permanent ban for dogs
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know dogs that have an offense to
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
never be allowed to go uh unmuzzled
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
again I might say you know 18 months or
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
or two years um but eventually you know
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
even Fierce dogs get older and you know
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
we might we might want to give them a
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
second chance and then if if um if they
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
do bite again then you know maybe that
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
would be a more a more permanent thing
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
um but I would also say uh you know to
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
the gentleman's Point um you know every
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
every municipality is different has has
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
different needs uh you know the needs of
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
of keen with you know crowded sidewalks
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
dogs walking around they're they're
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
different from um you know a place a
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
place out in the country
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
and you know this is an opportunity for
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
the municipal leaders the city
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
councilors or Selectmen to you know
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
respond to you know what are the needs
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
of their particular
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
area and um I would also say that
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
um I know that dog owners are very
 
00:57:46.109 --> 00:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
passionate about their dogs they love
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
their dogs you know we all love dogs um
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
and in the event that this would come up
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
before uh the city council or or any um
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal organization um every uh every
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
local lawmaker is going to be hearing
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
from their constituents about what what
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
they think about this which is great and
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's how it's supposed to work
 
00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
um but I would I would be very surprised
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
if uh you know a city council um was
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
particularly heavy-handed on this
 
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
because we know that there is a lot of
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
um constituent interest in things like
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs and making sure that
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
everyone's rights are maintained and um
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
I I don't think this is this is a case
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
where anyone would be eager to overstep
 
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
but at the same time you know we do have
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
a duty to our public to make sure that
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
um they will be safe in the streets from
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
from a dog that might attack thank you
 
00:58:37.359 --> 00:58:38.349 align:start position:0%
from a dog that might attack thank you
very

00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
much any other questions representative
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
Penza uh thank you madam
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
chair um looking over the legislation
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
it's literally just adding in one word
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
and um and I think you've explained it
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
Al in regards
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
with we already have law on the books
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
that's giving um the local governing
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
bodies the right of course for licensing
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
and restraining of dogs as it deems
 
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.470 align:start position:0%
and restraining of dogs as it deems
reasonable

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.190 align:start position:0%
reasonable
so

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.950 align:start position:0%
so
if

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
um that's already all in here so I I
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
guess I the concerns that people are
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
making they don't seem to to me to be
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
valid only because we've already you
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
already have the authority to to do
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
restraining so um through your local
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances I'd like to ask about what
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
first you know there's a now it's a $100
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
fine what's second offense what's third
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
offense when is a
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
dog taken away from an owner if it
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
continues to not just bite and attack uh
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
another animal but I I my more of my
 
00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
concern is the public so when does that
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
that happen how many offenses does it
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
take before someone
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
learns I I don't have that information
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
um but uh you know the goal here would
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
be to prevent that second representative
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
penzo we have um RSA 466 colon
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
31-a which establishes penalties for uh
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
dogs and cats that are yeah well musling
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
and restraining dogs and uh it it cites
 
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
$100 for the first vicious offense $400
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
for the second or subsequent vicious
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
offense um and then there is um
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the town or city clerk
 
01:00:36.839 --> 01:00:38.470 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the town or city clerk
uh

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
to you know assess that and collect
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
monies but um it it should also have the
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
cases disposed of in a district or
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
municipal court so at some point it's
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to court as I understand
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
the statute but um in any case okay good
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to answer your question
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's great so then a court could make
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
a decision if okay that dog is you know
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
deemed as far as I understand okay thank
 
01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
you um represent Gruber you had a
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
question yes uh thank you madam chair uh
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming to testify
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh this appears this the what we're
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
looking at here is an enabling
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislation so that local government
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
through their due process can decide
 
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
whether they would like to adopt a
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
musling ordinance um right now you
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
currently have authority to take away a
 
01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:26.549 align:start position:0%
currently have authority to take away a
dog

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
dog
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh my question is is does this give you
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
another valuable tool along the way
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
before taking away a dog it seems to me
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
that uh providing you a broader toolbox
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
before you get to more serious action
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
would actually uh be well received by
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
Community can you comment on that uh
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I would say that's that's
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely the intention here um you
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
know we want uh nobody nobody wants to
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
see a dog taken away no one wants to see
 
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
a dog put down um but this is you know
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
something that we can do that uh creates
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
you know a measure of protection for the
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
public without having to take those
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
extreme steps thank you any other
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
questions represent H Haskins thank you
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I'm not sure Mr Williams
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
is if you're the person to answer this
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
question the bill doesn't say after one
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
bite so um would you be comfortable in
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
your uh City to leave that up to
 
01:02:29.269 --> 01:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
local government is
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
there I mean we keep talking about it
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
after one bite but the bill doesn't say
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
that so would that be sufficient for you
 
01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:40.839 align:start position:0%
if musling were added as this bill
 
01:02:40.839 --> 01:02:41.789 align:start position:0%
if musling were added as this bill
currently

01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:41.799 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
reads uh yeah I believe um I don't have
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
the language in front of me but you know
 
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
the intention was always to apply to
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
vicious dogs which are defined in
 
01:02:54.069 --> 01:02:54.079 align:start position:0%
statute as doesn't say that
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
either well in our in our city council
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
deliberations we have always talked
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
about this as applying to Vici vicious
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
dogs which are defined as dogs that have
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
bitten represent yeah just uh for your
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
information the reference stat in
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
statute for a vicious dog is 466 colum
 
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
31 if I may ask does that mean that that
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be in this particular
 
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
bill because it's in the it statute
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
musling is not uh listed as a remedy
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%
46631 so the definition of vicious is
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
here but it doesn't and but the remedy
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
is a range of things from uh fines to
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
confiscation U musling is not listed as
 
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
a remedy in 466a thank you thank you any
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Howard
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair this just sort of
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
briefly um I know that in other towns
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
and cities they have allow musling for
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
dog breeds certain breeds of dogs and um
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
that that would not be part of your
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
ordinance would it no I wouldn't be
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
opposed to any um any breed based uh
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
musling ordinance um this is this is
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
behavior based and I think that's how it
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
should be thank you any other
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
much for taking the time to come and and
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%

01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
Baker good morning um my name is Kyle
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
Baker I'm with the law from WTH young
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
and Pignatelli and I'm here on behalf of
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Wildlife Federation
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Wildlife Federation is a
 
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
92-year-old nonpartisan nonprofit
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
organization that advocates for the
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
ability to hunt fish and trap in New
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we're here to talk some of
 
01:04:57.069 --> 01:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
our concerns have already been outlined
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
by Mr doam um we're mainly concerned
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
with the potential unintended
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
consequences and effects on hunting dogs
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
um hunting dogs are currently Exempted
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
um under 466 um 31 regarding um sort of
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
the leash law is the atlarge um
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that a dog be on a leash um
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
when it's off of the owner's property
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs are Exempted from there um
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
hunting dogs are highly trained um
 
01:05:23.789 --> 01:05:23.799 align:start position:0%
otherwise no one would be hunting with
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
them because they would be ineffective
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
so um we you know there's some concerns
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
um that we have because of that um 466
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
also um as we've it's already been
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned here um delves into what the
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
definition of a a vicious dog would be
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
um talks about specifically mentions a
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
dog that is out of control um whether or
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
not it's under the on the leash um it
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify it says if it bites
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
another dog um another domestic animal
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
or game animal it would be considered
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
and it allows law enforcement to seize
 
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
the dog um in a court order to determine
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
what what um what could happen there so
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
um understanding that um there's a
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
desire to move something away to um stop
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
a attack having to happen before the law
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
kicks in to do something about it um we
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
would suggest you know adding some more
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
specificity around it um it sounds like
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
Keen wants to do a fantastic thoughtful
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
job of designing an ordinance but uh
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
we'd feel more comfortable if there was
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
a few more guardrails in place around um
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
how uh musling would be impacted um take
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
licensing muzzling and restraining as
 
01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's listed in 466 39 are three very
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
different things um and have very
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
different effects on the dog so um
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
potentially an idea might be removing
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
musling from 466 39 and coming up with a
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
more specific um parameter along the
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
lines of saying that a municipality May
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
create an ordinance requiring uh
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins you talked about
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
it um requiring a dog that has a history
 
01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
of biting other dogs um to be muzzled um
 
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:53.799 align:start position:0%
and coming up with something a little
 
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
bit more uh specific around there I
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
think would definitely address our
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
concerns um but happy to work with the
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
committee of the sponsor and The
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
Advocates or answer any questions that
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
folks may
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
have represent Bixby do you think uh
 
01:07:10.829 --> 01:07:10.839 align:start position:0%
this uh a provision for musling would be
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
better located in 46631 or 31a I think
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
in you know 31 is uh is pretty has a lot
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
of specifics I think it's like a through
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
t or something along those lines there's
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of specific so maybe making it a
 
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
remedy for the court uh when the court
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
is is issuing an order on what what
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
happens in those cases that a court
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
order may include uh requiring that dog
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
to be muzzled when it's in a public
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
place um allows for some more due
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
process and ability to to folks to make
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
their case as well rather than just a
 
01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:39.630 align:start position:0%
their case as well rather than just a
blanket

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
blanket
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance uh go ahead so uh so I I'm I'm
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about the of of about a case
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
having to go through the court because
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
it seems like this is something that
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
could be done better at the
 
01:07:56.109 --> 01:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
administrative level Within in the
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
municipality rather than requiring it to
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
go through the court cycle which can be
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
very long and drawn out and expensive
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah no uh I I guess I'm sort of
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
agnostic on where where it happens as
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
far as that I think as long as there's
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
some sort of specificity that says you
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
know if a municipality or you know the
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
city of Keane since they're here I'll
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
use them as an example and saying we
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
don't want we want if a dog has a
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
history of biting other dogs if that dog
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
wants to operate on Main Street um and
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
they want to be walked on Main Street it
 
01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
has to have a muzzle okay versus just
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
saying if someone is out on Town land
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
with their dogs it has to have a muzzle
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
on it um my reading and I I don't think
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
it obviously I don't think it's the
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation to be Broad
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
and capture all dogs but if I want to
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
use my hunting dogs on Town pasture land
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the town May approve bird hunting on
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
its pasture land and I'm using my dogs
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
on pasture land and they have an
 
01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
ordinance in place that says um all dogs
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
in public must be have a Melana and I
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't think that's any body's intent um
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
but the language here would allow for
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
something along those lines and that's
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
why we have the concern so as long as
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of guard rails whether
 
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
that's a remedy for the court or just
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
saying that a municipality can pass an
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
ordinance regarding a dog with a
 
01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
violence violence history um something
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
along those lines would be amenable to
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
us followup yeah so uh so the key thing
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
would be to make sure that the that what
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
whatever we pass in uh indicates that
 
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
musling is
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
a remedy for a dog that is behaving
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
viciously yeah exactly okay thank
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
happened and
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh I do believe that when a dog
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
attacks for the first time the second it
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
should be muzzled it should be
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
muzzled that's all I can
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
say okay any other questions from the
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%

01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
morning good morning chair Aaron members
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Stacy oer
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
I'm the New England government relations
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
manager for the American Kennel Club
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
we're a recognized expert in K9 Health
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
breeding training and responsible dog
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
ownership I wanted to comment um this
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
morning on Senate excuse me House Bill
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
250 and note that this committee
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
entertained a bill last session for
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
instance where similar uh issue had
 
01:11:59.070 --> 01:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
happened with dangerous dogs and asking
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
for additional tools um the American
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
Kennel Club believes that there should
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
be a response based on the deed not the
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
breed of the dog and unfortunately
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
across the country our department does
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
see on occasion where a county or a city
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
or an ordinance in response to a a
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
particular attack May adopt
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
discriminatory language uh based on a
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
breed whether it's a pitbull or maybe it
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
was a German shepherd and what we know
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
is that when there is that type of
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination for instance uh what can
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
happen to dog owners is they can be
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
discriminated against even in their
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
rental insurance or their homeowners
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
insurance where insurers will say oh you
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
want a ro you own a Rottweiler we either
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
won't provide insurance or we're going
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
to escalate the premium even though your
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
particular dog may not have any
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous Behavior so in looking at the
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
bill I think it f fails to recognize
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
that the attempt here the is to
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
associate muzzling requirements with a
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
dog that has been identified as
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous I will say that the
 
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
international Municipal Lawyers
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
Association has model ordinance language
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
on how to go about identifying a
 
01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous dog what is a
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous dog it has all sorts of due
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
process protections it's quite lengthy
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to share it with committee
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
but in looking at the RSA uh
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
specifically that you were referring to
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has on the books um
 
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
466 colon
 
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
31 it defines vicious dog under
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
two um G if whether alone or in a pack
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
with other dogs it bites attacks or
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
prays on game animals domestic animals
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
fowl or human beings so that's a a a
 
01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
broad uh definition but there's no
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
procedure or process for
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
identifying um for the town to identify
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
or label a particular dog as dangerous
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
and then even monitor their behavior on
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
whether there's subsequent attacks or
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
incidents where the owner uh failed to
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
comply with the language in your statute
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
that says they could have an order to
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
restrain the dog I think it's arguable
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
whether restrain includes muzzling but
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
likewise just putting mu ing in here may
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
not be sufficient um your statute also
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
allows taking custody of the animal and
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
your hearing testimony where that may
 
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
not be the really the even the second
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
line of action that you'd like to take
 
01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to note that some
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
states have statutes that really provide
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
some guidance to municipalities around
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
an ordinance that they might want to
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
consider adopting and some of the uh
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
tools that are included are not just
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
muzzling but I thought I would just name
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
a few um like I said almost a statutory
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
road map to help cities and um uh towns
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
to identify you they may want to adopt
 
01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
an ordinance that there needs to be a
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
way to identify a dog once it's labeled
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
as dangerous so requiring a microchip or
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
a tattoo or something of that nature so
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
you can track it um might also require
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
remedial action that the owner go to
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
behavior training uh with the dog so
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
that that behavior is not
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
repeated um it may outline ways to
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
humanely restrain the dog other than
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
just saying when it's on when it's out
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
off your property you have to um have it
 
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
muzzled and even proof of insurance
 
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
against claims of loss damage injury to
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
people animals or property so these are
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
all the kinds of Provisions that
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually put into place I think a a
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
public safety mechanis ISM to ensure
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
that someone that owns a dangerous dog
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
is held accountable um the last thing
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'll say is that the statute appears to
 
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
not address instances where and
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
typically uh it comes down to in
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
identifying a dog is dangerous whether
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
or not the dog was provoked and I don't
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
see any language in your Statute in that
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
regard so uh oftentimes in state law
 
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.350 align:start position:0%
regard so uh oftentimes in state law
you'll

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
see okay if there was a bite injury or
 
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
whatnot were these exceptions in place
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh was the person trespassing clear
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's not the incident here uh was the
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
dog provoked have you ever seen young
 
01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
kids go by a vehicle and stick sticks
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
into a window to try and provoke you
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
know provoke an animal in there and
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
tease it um so I'm happy to provide that
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
kind of language if the committee wanted
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
to look at what other states have had
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
almost as some kind of goalposts or
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
whatever for their statute so thank you
 
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
for your attention I'd be delighted to
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
see that kind of language
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
personally any questions for Miss obber
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
um representative Howard thank you madam
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
chair um so would you would you make an
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
exception for a dog that was provoked
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
but went but did you know did great
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
bodily harm to another pet or or a
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
person so typically what we see is there
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
could be when I talked about the due
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
process a procedure where um the dog
 
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
owner would get a complaint and in short
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
order there would be a hearing of Select
 
01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
board members or sometimes it's even the
 
01:17:29.310 --> 01:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
Animal control officer themselves in
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
trying to hear from both sides of the
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
story and making a determination whether
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
or not the dog has been labeled
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous and frequently there's even a
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
process for taking that label off as you
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
heard earlier sometimes after
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
remediation behavior training maybe that
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
label is no longer appropriate um so I'm
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
happy to provide language around that
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
process that could local authorities
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
could use representative uh Bixby yeah
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
so um I I would love to see that that
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
model language do you have a sense of
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
whether it would make more sense to
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
include that in uh 431 or 431a or in uh
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
439 which the current bill uses uh um so
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
466 colon
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
31a in my experience from an attorney
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
drafting standpoint I've seen it
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
typically under the authority of
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities so under the statute that
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
allows municipalities to license dogs
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
and gives them all of that kind of
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
control because that's where the lo you
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
know it's local laws that typically are
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
where uh control of dogs takes place um
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
you already have over in another section
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
however the provisions you know around
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
addressing dogs as a menace nuisance or
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh vicious dog
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
so I can't answer specifically for New
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but you have two places I
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
think where it logically could go
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions from
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you very
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
much for coming and testifying on this
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
bill do representative Scully please
 
01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
take your seat uh you can bring the blue
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
sheet with you if you like bring the
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
blue sheet with you if you like for
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
um okay let's see here I'm going to say
 
01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
we have on the online port portal we
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
have seven people in support of this
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
sheet we have three people in support
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
and three people in
 
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
opposition and with that I'm going to
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
close out the hearing for 200 uh
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
hp250 and I want to thank everybody who
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
showed up today to come and testify on
 
01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.870 align:start position:0%
showed up today to come and testify on
that

01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill um okay moving right along we have
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
at 11:00 here uh HB
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
424 directing the Department of
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food to create
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
fors for businesses to request
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
information about service animals and
 
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
protection of business owners from
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
requests to accommodate customers with
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
animals so um before we have um our
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
start our hearing I did request um our
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
committee researcher to give us provide
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
us some information on state and federal
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
laws governing service animals so that
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
we are familiar with um you know what
 
01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
what the different requirements are um
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
the questions that I asked her to
 
01:20:49.229 --> 01:20:49.239 align:start position:0%
research were what does New Hampshire
 
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
law require regarding service animals
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
what does federal law require regarding
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
service animals do service animals have
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
registered is there a mechanism to
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
determine the legitimacy of a purported
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
service animal is it legally permissible
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
to ask a service animal owner for
 
01:21:09.790 --> 01:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
documentation to prove the service
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
animal status is there a difference
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
between a service animal and an
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
emotional support animal what species of
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
animals are accepted as service animals
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
what are businesses required to do
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
regarding service animals and are there
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
any locations where use of service
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
animals are prohibited so I'm just going
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
to pass copies of this report out to you
 
01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
you can look at it at uh after this
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
hearing to become more familiar with uh
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
how we deal with this and then
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
hearing does everybody have a copy of
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
the bill by the
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
four does everybody have a copy of the
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
um I am going to open up the hearing for
 
01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.510 align:start position:0%
um I am going to open up the hearing for
HB

01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
424 and I invite representative
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
Stringham to introduce the bill to our
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
committee good morning and thank you for
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
coming good morning uh thank you madam
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh my name is Jerry Stringham I
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
represent Grafton County Third District
 
01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh which includes the town of Lincoln
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
and Woodstock and
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
Easton uh an area filled with uh lots of
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants and hotels brings in lots of
 
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
visitors uh not from uh just New England
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
but from all over the country and in
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
fact all over the world
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh so uh uh the issue uh with this bill
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh is particularly uh significant for
 
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
for those in my district uh House Bill
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
424 is called directing the Department
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture markets and food to
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
create forms for businesses to request
 
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
information about service animals and
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
protection of business owners from
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
requests to accommodate customers with
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
fraudulent or untrained service animals
 
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
so uh you in in part I'm I'm sure you've
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
all experienced and we know that there's
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh how critical service animals are for
 
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
our disabled population and how much uh
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
how the uh fed federal laws require
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
access for people who who need a service
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
animal to function normally uh and uh we
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
also know that there's uh been uh
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
widespread uh uh distribution ution of
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
artificial vests and things that people
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
are taking advantage of of the service
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
animal requirements by saying their dog
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
is a service animal when in reality it's
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
either a pet or perhaps just a comfort
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
animal of some type and it's gotten to
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
the to the uh to the level where it's a
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
major problem uh uh perhaps for for all
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
businesses but uh particularly for
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
restaurants and
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
hotels um so HB 424 deals with the
 
01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.669 align:start position:0%
hotels um so HB 424 deals with the
individuals

01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting uh the service animal
 
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
status of their pets so they can access
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh restaurants and a hotel in a way uh
 
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
this this was brought to me by local uh
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
hotels originally uh but um uh groups
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire uh lodging and
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association and individual
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant owners said this is not this
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
is a daily occurrence where animals that
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
that uh most certainly don't appear to
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
be service animals are being represented
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
that way um I'm glad you you've done the
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh the research you've had uh we're very
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
very very restricted on what we can do
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire uh without
 
01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:15.639 align:start position:0%
violating the Americans with
 
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act so uh part part of this
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
process uh was um you know to seek out
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
those that we would need uh uh support
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
of and input from to come up with the
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
right rules for example I met with uh
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
Sean Lock who is in the Attorney
 
01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:37.239 align:start position:0%
General's office with over five years of
 
01:25:39.629 --> 01:25:39.639 align:start position:0%
experience in Disability Policy and
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
there's people here from the disability
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
rights Center uh and uh involved in that
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
area as well as talking with the the Bia
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
and uh the New Hampshire um lodging and
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
so the the the laws and and disclosures
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
largely address the importance rights to
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
those granted with need and disservice
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
animal blind is the most common but
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
there are there are other ones that are
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
that are done as well but the the
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
federal laws themselves there are no
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
real requirements for in my view no real
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
requirements to qualify a service animal
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
they don't have to be professionally
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
trained you as an individual can certify
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
that your pet is a service animal and
 
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
that it it takes uh it takes over a
 
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
function that you need taken care of
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
because of some disability so an example
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
of that might be I hurt my back and I
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
teach my dog that if I accidentally drop
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
a tennis ball that he'll go pick it up
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
and bring it back to me and so I don't
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
have to bend over and pick it up so
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's an a function so it's essentially
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
playing uh catch or fetch with a with an
 
01:26:59.159 --> 01:27:00.750 align:start position:0%
playing uh catch or fetch with a with an
animal

01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
animal
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
that that could legitimately say that I
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
could represent that my dog is a is a
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
service dog with something that minor
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's part of federal
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
law um and um so and we're also
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
restricted on how much we can ask you're
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to ask if it's not obvious what
 
01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
the what the uh dis ability is that you
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
have you can ask what is the disability
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's uh being taken care of and is
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
your is your pet a service animal those
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
are the only two questions and uh in my
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
uh experience even you know lowlevel or
 
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
floral Level Restaurant workers and uh
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
are are familiar with that and follow
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
that um the uh I did provide a copy of
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh this notice uh and there's there's
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody this is available
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh from the governor's Commission on
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
disability which says it it's illegal to
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
misrepresent a pet as a service animal
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
um and you know G given given the
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
definition of a Ser service Animal by
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
federal law I I don't think we're we've
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
going to see any uh any people you know
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
being fine $1,200 successfully uh with
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
that but still this this has been
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
somewhat helpful for people who come in
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
and try to check in a hotel or or make a
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
reservation and claim their dog as a
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
service dog and they just at least have
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
this up the idea of uh uh having a form
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
or something that could be filled out is
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
also to put in uh have it be directly
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
visible to people at the point when
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
they're asking uh for service for for
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
Mis branded animal uh what their
 
01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
expectations are things like if you do
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
have a a service pet you're expected to
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
keep them under control at all time
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're expected to be in in in almost
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
all circumstances in your presence so uh
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
these are the things that uh the hotels
 
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
and restaurants say at least there's
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
some dialogue uh that can can occur
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
before uh the pet Co pet uh is is
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
granted access to the service
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh the conversations that I've had um uh
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
the the the challenges with the for is
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you're asking extra
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
things for um people with legitimate
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
service animals and you know we're
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
really have to deal with both sides of
 
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
this we can't this anything we do can't
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
violate uh the Ada as it exists today
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
um uh the conversations with the
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office basic one of
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
the when you're checking into a hotel or
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
making a reservation normally you are
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
filling out a form of some type
 
01:30:07.629 --> 01:30:07.639 align:start position:0%
electronically and uh at the point where
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
you you could ask whether they plan to
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
bring a pet uh that would be um it would
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
be reasonable to um at least ask these
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
two questions and then have the other
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
information about having a pet at at the
 
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.149 align:start position:0%
information about having a pet at at the
facility

01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
um uh in plain sight and and reacted to
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
it so um you know uh you know just given
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
given the uh uh the restrictions of the
 
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
Ada um uh you know when when I drafted
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
this bill I was thinking both
 
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants and
 
01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
hotels uh hotels very commonly have have
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
you fill out a form of some type to stay
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
there so that would be less of a stretch
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
to try to uh uh increase these notice
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions with without
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
um uh without in any way violating the
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
very important rights that we give our
 
01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
disabled so um uh you know I I believe
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's reasonable and possible to do
 
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
that and uh and and perhaps reduce some
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
of the chaos uh that's going on in some
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
of these facilities and uh at least at
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
least one restaurant I know of when when
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
they shut down uh talked about uh the
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
the annoyance of of uh having misbranded
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
animals being part of their customer
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
base and what they did and that was
 
01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:42.070 align:start position:0%
base and what they did and that was
just

01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's not not not fair for them either
 
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.149 align:start position:0%
uh it's not not not fair for them either
so

01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
um uh I guess with that I'll open up and
 
01:31:54.189 --> 01:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
see if you have any questions okay thank
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
you before we take questions I'd like my
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
U members to take their
 
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
seats thank you for waiting and being
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
patient representative King thank you
 
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for the bill
 
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
and testifying and taking
 
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
questions um I I like easy solutions and
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of I at least I
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
think I thought of a solution that to me
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
seems simple and that is like with the
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
disabled and they have the blue placards
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
that they hang up on their uh rearview
 
01:32:29.189 --> 01:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
mirror or on their license plate and
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
pretty much all the businesses support
 
01:32:33.629 --> 01:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
that with some extra parking spaces
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
nobody needs to explain to anybody else
 
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
why they have that blue placard uh it's
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
private business but it's accepted that
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
there it is um why can't there be
 
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
something similar like that for dogs
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
which is you know you get your doctor's
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
written permission slip to have one and
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
then you get your dog from an accredited
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
whatever and and long story short you
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
eventually get like a state issued green
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
placard or something that goes around
 
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
the dog's neck or is attached to the
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
back you normally they wear these vests
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's a big sticker on
 
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
there and then that way everybody can
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
just easily recognize yep that is a
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
certified trained service dog you know
 
01:33:24.870 --> 01:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
and yeah there might be some fraud about
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
somebody who like carries that dog with
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
them it's really their dad's dog but
 
01:33:31.870 --> 01:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
they take it with them to the store um
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
that might happen some but generally
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
speaking that placard is going to be
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
pretty difficult to come by and the it
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
would greatly reduce the amount of Fraud
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
and Abuse around that instead of having
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
to bother or put a burden on business
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
owners to have to fill out paperwork or
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's just yep I see
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
that Dog's good come on in nope that dog
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a placard can't come in
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on that uh I mean
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
I would love it but it's violation of
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
the Americans with Disabilities Act
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
which specifically says you can't have
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
any licensing type requirements for that
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
they don't they they can't uh you can't
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
require them to be registered you can't
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
require them to um have completed formal
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
training or have a c certificate like
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
that that's my understanding of of the
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
Ada is that's that's not not um we we
 
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
can't do that they do have those vests
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
and little cards that people do but you
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
can order them if somebody has a
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
computer look up on Amazon right now you
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
can buy them and and put them on that's
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
about all that exists and so um that I
 
01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
would have loved that solution if that
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
if it was something that everybody could
 
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
agree to followup follow up um okay I'm
 
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with what you're
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
referring to but I'm just curious what I
 
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
mean do you know the reason why that is
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
because I mean it's not a hippo viol
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
people don't consider it a hippo
 
01:35:00.189 --> 01:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
violation to put a blue placard up on
 
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
your car you're telling the whole world
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
that you've got a disability but we
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
still don't consider that a hippo
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
violation do you under do you know why
 
01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government thinks it would
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
be a hippo violation to have a placard
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
on your dog or it's not a hippo
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
violation or an ADA violation why why is
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
that do did do they provide a reasoning
 
01:35:21.229 --> 01:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know I think when they created
 
01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
created this U my understanding is they
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
just felt like it would be too
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
burdensome uh a requirement for those
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
who need service animals to have to go
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
through that process and so it's written
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
into the uh Ada at least one of them is
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
one of the documents that I've they've
 
01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
given you and uh there are other people
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
here who can who who live with uh making
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
sure that the lives of our disabled are
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
highquality ones that are speaking as
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
well that uh both understand the
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
understand the needs for our businesses
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
but also the Urgent protection of the
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
disabled as well sorry um thank you and
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
I only have one pink card so if anybody
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
wants to speak please make sure you send
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair
 
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
um I just had a question in regards with
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
the notice that you um had talked about
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
so so this is basically um the
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
businesses have been putting this have
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
been posting this and you're saying it's
 
01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.189 align:start position:0%
been posting this and you're saying it's
been

01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
successful I think I think they they
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
found they were getting some um it was
 
01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
helpful it was helpful not not adequate
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
but better than better than uh when they
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
did when I was first approached the
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
first time they did not know about this
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
notice so and then you know said let me
 
01:36:51.149 --> 01:36:51.159 align:start position:0%
know how this works and then said well
 
01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:54.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it's helpful in having a discussion
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
when somebody comes in with clearly a
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
non-service animal which is most of the
 
01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
time an animal shows up at these
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
businesses it's usually not really a
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
service animal because they recognize
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
the service animals almost right away
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
given their temperament and training and
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
so on followup followup um there's a
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
there's a gentleman that comes to our
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
church that um has a a service dog um he
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
was in the military and
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
has this is I can't tell you if if he
 
01:37:29.950 --> 01:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
could do this all day long because it
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
really really bothers him um
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
this fakeness that's out there um
 
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
because it it hurts it hurts their work
 
01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.669 align:start position:0%
because it it hurts it hurts their work
now

01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
um You can tell the difference really
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
you can by the ones that you're buying
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
online which if everybody hasn't um seen
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
that it's it's really easy to get
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
um and slap it on an animal and act as
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
if it's their service animal so um maybe
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
there's a a way to show um information
 
01:38:07.790 --> 01:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
wise of that
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
legitimacy like ones that you know I
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
know you can see where his dog came from
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
um uh it's credible organization that is
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
teaching training service dogs matching
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
all of that kind of stuff versus I mean
 
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
you can tell from the criteria that's on
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
his animal and you're not allowed to
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
touch his animal so that's what I'm is
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
there a way like I I know this notice
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
piece but is there more that could be
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
done in a sense to say okay um we know
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
that this is not legit but this is do
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm saying like in just um
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
having having that be out
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
there well I think we have you know we
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
have some good people to ask that about
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
I know that you know I've been been
 
01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:56.679 align:start position:0%
frustrated by the exact language of the
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act
 
01:39:02.669 --> 01:39:02.679 align:start position:0%
provision here and um you know I trust
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
that they put them there for a good
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
reason but it it it is creating some
 
01:39:10.109 --> 01:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
chaos and and
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
um you my understanding of the federal
 
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
law is that there's no requirement that
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
the dog have anything on them in in any
 
01:39:24.189 --> 01:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
way and uh it's really a a a self
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's the the individual himself who says
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's a service dog and what
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
disability uh it helps helps him or her
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
with thank you for the question do you
 
01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
know do you know if there's any uh um
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
um impetus to change federal law the Ada
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
law to to allow
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
for any kind
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
of better designation of service animals
 
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:55.159 align:start position:0%
you know I I would I would consider it a
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable you know partial outcome of
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
this process is to ask the federal
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
government to do something and what that
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
might be um but as far as I know there's
 
01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.229 align:start position:0%
might be um but as far as I know there's
no

01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
pending uh nothing uh okay currently uh
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
in the loop okay representative wheeler
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
you had a question and then over to this
 
01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
side Gully thank you madam chair thank
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
you representative Stringham for taking
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
my question good to see you as well my
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
question is representative King asked
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
about the blue placard which I thought
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
was a good question and I am too
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
frustrated to hear about the
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
Ada's lack of thoughtfulness when it
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
comes to these issues but I'm wondering
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
if the blue form is not compliant with
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
Ada standards is the form that's
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
outlined here compliant with Ada
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
standards as far as you understand I you
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
I'm you know having had the
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
conversations with with uh uh
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
individuals uh who are in this room and
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
with Sean Sean Lock I I don't think the
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
form uh uh I I think they would have
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
concerns um that it's too far-reaching
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
at this point uh and um
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh I feel very very good about the
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
experience and skill levels the those
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
people bring to the process um and um
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know ultimately it's really uh
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
you know for businesses to want to have
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
engage uh uh more with you know their
 
01:41:38.109 --> 01:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
their important customers
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
about what to expect when they come to
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
the to the uh uh to their
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
establishment um you know we really need
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
the uh Attorney General's office to kind
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
of set those bounds you know based on
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
Federal and State law so um uh which is
 
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
which is why I did that uh Outreach
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
after submitting this bill so um you
 
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
know part part of the bill also talks
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
about having a study committee uh and um
 
01:42:13.709 --> 01:42:13.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know to work out any details but
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
part part of that is um part of the
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
reason why focused on the lodging is
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
because interaction between uh an
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
establishment and their customer using a
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
form uh to make a reservation is common
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
whereas it's fairly incommon for
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants followup Madam shair
 
01:42:36.669 --> 01:42:36.679 align:start position:0%
followup yep thank you so you kind of
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
got to my follow-up question there and
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
your answer would you be amenable to
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
removing the first section of the bill
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
and making it simply a study committee
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
to study this issue over the course of
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
the summer and come back with a
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
potential solution having worked with
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
the attorney General's office and other
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on this
 
01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
issue and hopefully this esteemed
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
committee absolutely yeah absolutely
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative Scully then Howard
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chair and um good
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for putting this
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
before as I think this is something that
 
01:43:13.589 --> 01:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
should be considered I I would think
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
that um businesses assume a liability
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
when somebody walks in the door with
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
their dog and presents it as a a service
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
animal and I think think this is a good
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
idea to May at least get them to certify
 
01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
they may be lying but at least you have
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
on record that they are I was wondering
 
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
if there was any potential for offering
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
relief to businesses from potential
 
01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
liability if they go to the trouble of
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
getting this completed and the person
 
01:43:42.030 --> 01:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
lied to them and their dog ends up
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
biting somebody while they're in
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
there uh you know I I I I guess most of
 
01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:50.679 align:start position:0%
the businesses I deal with just you know
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
don't want the hassle so it's hard to
 
01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
kick out somebody and there's dogs who
 
01:43:57.030 --> 01:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
come in and eat Foods off other people's
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
plates and uh uh and uh uh you know even
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
get so excited they uh you know p on the
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
floor or something like that and Y um
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
and sometimes even asking those people
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
to leave in those circumstances is uh is
 
01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:16.109 align:start position:0%
to leave in those circumstances is uh is
not

01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
um is not uh very uh helpful or easy for
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
them it doesn't doesn't give you good
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
ratings on Yelp let me put it that
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
way so um you know they I mean there is
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
assumed liability by in the part of the
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
pet owner if the pet does do damage at
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
the restaurant excuse me could you pull
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
the mic a little closer to you sure
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
sorry about that thank you so there is
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
there is assumed liability on the part
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
of the part of the pets assuming you
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
know who the person you know but um I
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't know of too many cases where
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
where um these businesses really want to
 
01:45:00.310 --> 01:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
pursue something like that
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
so but thank you for the question okay
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative Howard then Bixby then
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair um so my
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is that your hands are
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
tied by the Ada laws including you can't
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
even ask what the disability is or what
 
01:45:18.990 --> 01:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
the service dog provides so you you can
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
ask what the disability is oh I've I've
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
always had push back from the I you know
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know what would happen if they
 
01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:27.750 align:start position:0%
I don't know what would happen if they
don't

01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
answer and whether you could you you
 
01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
just say is this a service dog and what
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
is the disability and those are the only
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
two questions you can ask okay so my
 
01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
question was about the form whether or
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
not it it probes to more deeply than it
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
than it's allowed to and also um I
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to sort of um piggyback on to uh
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative Wheeler's idea of having
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
this be a study with part of the outcome
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
being um a a an application to the
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
federal um lawmakers about changing
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
loosening this up because I do think
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
there is a broad abuse of this um
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
designation of
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
pets thank you um I appreciate that
 
01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
pets thank you um I appreciate that
repres

01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
repres
 
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
Biby yeah um I just wanted to uh get a
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
little clarification are dogs the only
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh species that are allowed to be
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh no there's other animals although
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
dogs are the by far the most
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
common but I think I've seen miniature
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
horses are even in the specifically
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
listed in the Ada uh documents but what
 
01:46:41.589 --> 01:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
else is I'm not sure thank you I've
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
actually seen helper
 
01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
monkeys yep yeah um representative
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
Penza uh thank you madam chair uh thank
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I have a
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
um what can a business owner do now so I
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
have personally witnessed and received
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
phone calls from constituents um
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
actually some that came before I was
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
elected um first term and where dog ate
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
food off of um another guests um it it
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
was awful that um I was actually at a
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant where the dog defecated on
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
the floor I mean I just
 
01:47:33.589 --> 01:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
where um but that the this dog that did
 
01:47:35.950 --> 01:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
that when I was there did not have like
 
01:47:38.669 --> 01:47:38.679 align:start position:0%
a jacket on or anything it was just you
 
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
know this is my service
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
animal where right now in the law um is
 
01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
there any um outlet for a business owner
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
well I don't know if I'm the best person
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
to answer I do know that the
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
establishments have the absolute right
 
01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
to ask any anybody who's brought a
 
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
service animal in uh to if that is not
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
being properly controlled and behaved to
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
to leave immediately uh they are also
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
required to offer the services to them
 
01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
without the dog if the dog leaves um but
 
01:48:24.589 --> 01:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
so that's part of what's in uh um uh law
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
whether they're uh whether there's
 
01:48:30.390 --> 01:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for any Financial
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
restitution through whatever civil
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
process might be available I don't know
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay representative
 
01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
Skully I'm sorry guber I'm getting
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
everybody mixed up today great thank you
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
grber thank you m chair um I'm still
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get up the speed of the
 
01:48:49.149 --> 01:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
difference between a service dog and a
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
comfort dog the Ada publication got
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
here um it says the service animals are
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
dog they only this dog but you mentioned
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
it might be a horse so I'm really
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
confused and then the other issue is
 
01:49:08.109 --> 01:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
they service dogs have to uh help with a
 
01:49:10.589 --> 01:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
disability and um it includes
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
psychological disability uh so if you
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
have an anxiety attack and you can show
 
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
that the dog helps you with the anxiety
 
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
attack it's a service dog so I'm really
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
confused the difference between a
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
comfort dog I think we have definition
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
problems it's going to be difficult to
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
create legislation in a system until we
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
get these definitions really defined
 
01:49:30.589 --> 01:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
somehow any comments on these
 
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
definitions and how overlapping they
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
appear to be um well a comfort dog or or
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
animals is ordinarily you may be
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
prescribed by could be prescribed by a
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
physician to help calm somebody down but
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of the Ada and the federal law
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's service animals and then there's
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
non-service anim animals in terms of uh
 
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
these rights of access to public
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
accommodations so I mean I'm not a
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer but the the
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
um um you know all all the all the all
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
restaurants and hotels are not
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
obligated uh typically to take
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
non-service dogs they can set up their
 
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
own rules as they want but service
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
animals are um absolutely
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
you know granted the
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
accommodations and uh I think also
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
granted not just the service uh the
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
individual with a disability but also uh
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
the trainer of the animal uh would be gr
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
granted access along with the service
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
animal so but if if you if
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
um um so I guess that's about as much
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
depth as I can go into right now but uh
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
people a lot of times they show up and
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
first they're they're a comfort animal
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
and then they realize that that's not
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
going to get them into the into the
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
hotel so it becomes a service dog at
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
some point or service
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
animal that's where we have the problem
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
represent Penza I know time sorry madam
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
chair all right just real quick um
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
because I think that this could possibly
 
01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:19.800 align:start position:0%
be helpful because we're there's a lot
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
of conversation that has been brought up
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
about a lot of these things are going to
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
um really need to be handled on the
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
federal level um or there needs to be uh
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
further definitions and and um some
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
clarifications that are taking place
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
there um would it be helpful if our
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
committee came together and um you know
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
with a letter to our federal delegation
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
asking them to um to kind of step into
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
this issue maybe we can even uh speak to
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
our friends on the other side of the
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
aisle that are part of their um
 
01:51:55.950 --> 01:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
environment uh agriculture committee and
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
um and and see if we could do a joint
 
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
letter that to our federal delegation in
 
01:52:02.669 --> 01:52:02.679 align:start position:0%
regards with this um especially if this
 
01:52:04.069 --> 01:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
is going to be something that turns into
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
a study committee just to bring some
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
attention to it because I it's been an
 
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
issue covid is really where I feel it
 
01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
this kind of went um to the point okay
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
yeah exploded so um what Would You Do
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
you think that would be a good idea
 
01:52:20.119 --> 01:52:22.750 align:start position:0%
you think that would be a good idea
helpful

01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
just just for the federal government to
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
know that we're looking at at Poss
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
possibly suggesting reforms uh on this
 
01:52:34.109 --> 01:52:34.119 align:start position:0%
and that um you know we're going to have
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
a coalition representing or a committee
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
representing kind of all sides so that
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh if there are suggestions that fully
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
protect the disabled and their their
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
rights and their accesses but uh uh
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
could impact the
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
um the misbranding and and uh abuse
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
really of of the law I it sounds like a
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable idea to me I just I just
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
would want
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
everybody uh that that really
 
01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:08.679 align:start position:0%
understands the life of the disabled as
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
well as those who understand what it's
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
like to run a a business that uh
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
operates that way uh be included thank
 
01:53:21.589 --> 01:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby yeah um I'm was
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
just looking at the study committee
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
section of the bill as written uh and I
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
noticed that you have three members of
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate and a quorum of
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
four um have you ever seen three members
 
01:53:45.149 --> 01:53:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
committee yeah that's probably more than
 
01:53:50.229 --> 01:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
we need in the Senate so so if we change
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
that to one Senator and a quorum of
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
three you would be fine with it yeah
 
01:53:55.629 --> 01:53:55.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%

lengthy
 
01:54:10.030 --> 01:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
questions um we have two more pink cards
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%

01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
our Commissioner of Department of
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
Agriculture Sean
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you madam chairman
 
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:54:31.709 --> 01:54:31.719 align:start position:0%
I am Sean
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
Jasper commissioner of the Department of
 
01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food uh I'm
 
01:54:38.790 --> 01:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
going to bite my tongue on all my
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
personal feelings here but I will so
 
01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:45.639 align:start position:0%
I'll just stick to the to the issue um
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture is not the
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
place for the form to be created I would
 
01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
would suggest and you will hear from
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr SE on from the governor's uh
 
01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability I would suggest
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying that he's he's agreed
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
but certainly they would be in a better
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
better position to create a form I have
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
looked at the law I don't think a a form
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
could be created such as this that would
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
meet the uh federal law and so if you
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
decided to send it to the Department of
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um unless the the Attorney
 
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
General's office signed off on it I
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
would have to decline to to create a
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
form that violated the Americans with
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
Disability Act that's just not something
 
01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
that I would be willing to do but in no
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
case should a form like this be on us
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
because it really doesn't have anything
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
to do with agriculture even though we
 
01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:42.679 align:start position:0%
regulate the pet trade still not not the
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
place where I believe it should be and I
 
01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719 align:start position:0%
will conclude with that okay thank you
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
any questions for the
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner okay thank you very much I
 
01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
believe there's a pink card that needs
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
morning good morning my name is Karen
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director for
 
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
the disability rights Center which is
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's protection and advocacy
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
system for people with disabilities and
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we've I've ever been
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
before this committee but I've only been
 
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
policy director for about three and a
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
half years or so so well welcome thank
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
you um so I I understand that you did
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
secure some really robust research I
 
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that before I came but I
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
thought it might be handy for you to
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
have just a one pager with a highlight
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
on it which what I'm circulating or
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
what's being circulated is the Federal
 
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
Regulation the Ada regulation that's
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
pertinent to this bill that has to do
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
with service animals and the questions
 
01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
can be that can be asked and the
 
01:56:59.310 --> 01:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition against requiring any
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
documentation so um so to be clear our
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
office opposes this bill because we feel
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
that it clearly violates the Americans
 
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
with Disabilities Act and that it could
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
create potential liability for the
 
01:57:18.149 --> 01:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
restaurants especially or other um
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
public accommodations that might attempt
 
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
to rely on this for form whether it's
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
done by the agriculture department or
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission because um it
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
far exceeds what's what is um
 
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
permissible under federal law so um as
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
you know the Americans with Disabilities
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
Act was passed originally back in I
 
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
believe 1990 to ensure that people with
 
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities have equal access to
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
government programs employment and in
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
this what's relevant here public
 
01:57:54.069 --> 01:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
accommodations and it requires um public
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
accommodations we'll just limit it to
 
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
that since that's what this is about to
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
make reasonable accommodations to their
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
or modifications to their policies or
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
practices to enable people with
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities to have equal access to use
 
01:58:08.189 --> 01:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
and enjoy their
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
accommodations and the ability to have a
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
service animal if that's required is
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
such an
 
01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
accommodation so what you will knowe
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
when you look at the regulation is that
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
there are only two permissible questions
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
that may be asked and and they does
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
actually does not permit a public
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
accommodation to ask a patron what is
 
01:58:27.719 --> 01:58:28.550 align:start position:0%
accommodation to ask a patron what is
your

01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
disability um it a a per a um an
 
01:58:36.189 --> 01:58:36.199 align:start position:0%
accommodation can ask whether um an
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
animal is required because of a
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
disability and what activity that um
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
what service that animal has been
 
01:58:48.270 --> 01:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
trained to perform that's it um and it
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
also specifically provides that um a
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
public comination cannot require a
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
person with a disability to provide
 
01:58:59.390 --> 01:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
documentation now this sounds all very
 
01:59:02.109 --> 01:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
Broad and perhaps concerning given the
 
01:59:06.069 --> 01:59:06.079 align:start position:0%
kinds of um issues that you've discussed
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
and that prompted um The Spill to be
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
filed um but there are some also some
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
guard rails in the Ada and there are
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
some existing Provisions in our state
 
01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
law that address this so for someone
 
01:59:22.109 --> 01:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
with a disability who uses a service
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
animal they are expected to maintain
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
control of that animal um if that animal
 
01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
starts doing things that are
 
01:59:33.069 --> 01:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
inappropriate like eating someone's food
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
defecating um the public accommodation
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
can ask that that person leave and and
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
and actually require them to leave um we
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
also have um remedies in our state law
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
for someone who unlawfully uses a
 
01:59:51.629 --> 01:59:51.639 align:start position:0%
service animal so if someone were to
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
protect prend that their pet is an an is
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
a service animal and the um owner of the
 
01:59:59.000 --> 01:59:59.910 align:start position:0%
a service animal and the um owner of the
public

01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
accommodation um doesn't think this is a
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
legit service animal um they can well
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
they can ask the two questions but if
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
they're still not satisfied they could
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
contact the police it's a misdemeanor to
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
misrepresent your animal your pet as a
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
service animal so that's in 167
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
d8 which um probably your researcher I
 
02:00:23.229 --> 02:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
should have made copies of that for you
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
all but I didn't um I'm I'm assuming
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
your researcher uncovered um RSA 167 d8
 
02:00:33.510 --> 02:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
which um talks about what's prohibited
 
02:00:36.189 --> 02:00:36.199 align:start position:0%
um which has to do with um it does have
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
to do with um if you go to um four
 
02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
unlawful for any person to represent
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
that such person has a disability or is
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
a service um animal trainer um so and I
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
also believe it prohibits them for oh
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
yes and number two you can't represent
 
02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
that an animal is a service animal um if
 
02:00:59.470 --> 02:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
the animal's not a service animal and
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
then the next section of the law
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
um well actually the two sections later
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
167 d10 is the is where you will find
 
02:01:11.069 --> 02:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
the provisions which make such um
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
activities misdemeanors under our
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
current law so I think that there it
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like there are some issues here
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
and that there are people who oh I'm
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry representative
 
02:01:26.189 --> 02:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
wheeler were you no no no I was just
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
trying to get the just trying to get the
 
02:01:29.310 --> 02:01:29.320 align:start position:0%
attention of the chair so that I could
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
ask a question when you were done I
 
02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to interrupt you no continue
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
and and we'll have plenty of questions
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of questions just lost my
 
02:01:43.069 --> 02:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
um so so I guess I've totally lost my
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
train of thought here but what I'll try
 
02:01:52.069 --> 02:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
to I'll try to regroup um so I guess you
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
know I think what it comes down to is
 
02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
that there may be more training required
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
for our owners of public accommodations
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
to understand what the Ada requires of
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of what questions
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
they may ask what they can ask what it
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
requires in terms of the person with a
 
02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
disability who is the Handler who has
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know and the control that's required
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
as as well as what the state law
 
02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
provides around people who are not
 
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
entitled to have disab um service
 
02:02:23.709 --> 02:02:23.719 align:start position:0%
animals and it also might require some
 
02:02:26.669 --> 02:02:26.679 align:start position:0%
education of our local law enforcement
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
um in case they're not aware of the
 
02:02:32.109 --> 02:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
penalty that's available if someone is
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
violating the law but but what we don't
 
02:02:36.990 --> 02:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
want to do is punish people with
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities or make them feel unwelcome
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
require them to go through additional
 
02:02:43.709 --> 02:02:43.719 align:start position:0%
Hoops um that people who don't
 
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
experience a disability would have to go
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
through so I'm happy to take any
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you yeah we we
 
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with that statement and
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
we don't want to um cause problems for
 
02:02:58.990 --> 02:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
people with legitimate
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities so um
 
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
but given given what we've heard
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
already how how does a a a a an
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
establishment owner deal with that
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
situation given that they can't ask for
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
any kind of proof I
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
mean that that's just I mean they can
 
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
ask those two questions I had you know
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
even earlier today in an earlier hearing
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
somebody brought a dog into the
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee room which is not
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
allowed and the only question I can ask
 
02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
is you know is that a service
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
animal I I don't know for sure if it's
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
it was or was not but that's all I can
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
ask well right you could ask whether um
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's required because they need to have
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
this animal because of a disability and
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
what service that animal um has been
 
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
trained to perform what task or work
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
that animal has been trained to perform
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
you could ask those two questions and it
 
02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
is possible that someone could lie about
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
that right and I mean it would be great
 
02:04:06.549 --> 02:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
if we lived in a society where everyone
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
was honest all the time and we didn't
 
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
you know and and we didn't actually need
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
police because everyone just compli with
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
the law but we don't and this is
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
probably one that people do violate and
 
02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
it's possible that some people could get
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
away with it um I suppose if it's a
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
situation where someone's someone's
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
gaming it they're getting away with it
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
but the animal is staying right at their
 
02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
feet not bothering anyone not doing
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
anything that person just got away with
 
02:04:34.669 --> 02:04:34.679 align:start position:0%
something that they shouldn't have right
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
but probably there's not any harm done
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
but the thing is you know it's all well
 
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
and good that we have a notice that we
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
can say that you know it's illegal to
 
02:04:48.270 --> 02:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
misrepresent but there's no way to ask
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
for proof to to see to to
 
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
see that that that they are
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting I think that the reason
 
02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
is if I had to surmise when the Ada was
 
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
passed and when the requirements were
 
02:05:03.310 --> 02:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
put into place around the Ada and when
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
you're looking at public accommodations
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
these are places that people like a
 
02:05:09.629 --> 02:05:09.639 align:start position:0%
store you go in for five minutes you
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
know or it's a restaurant that you're
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
there for an hour or it's you know
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
you're getting a cup of coffee or you
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
know so these are I mean but it applies
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
to other you know facilities where you
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
might stay longer as well but um so the
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
idea was not was to not have barriers
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
for people with
 
02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities um does that mean that
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
someone isn't going to try to take
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
advantage and I think that the guard
 
02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
rails there are that there are certain
 
02:05:38.669 --> 02:05:38.679 align:start position:0%
expectations for how the person with a
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
disability um is responsible for their
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
service animal and and how well behaved
 
02:05:47.069 --> 02:05:47.079 align:start position:0%
that service animal has to be things
 
02:05:49.549 --> 02:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
like that and it is possible that
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
someone could have a very well- behaved
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
animal and get away with it and there's
 
02:05:55.149 --> 02:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
I mean there's other things that people
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
get away with in our society too
 
02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:58.270 align:start position:0%
get away with in our society too
representative

02:05:58.270 --> 02:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you madam chair and I'm
 
02:06:02.350 --> 02:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
sorry Karen for interrupting you I
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that's okay should have
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
remembered what I learned in school
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
don't raise your hand while someone's
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
talking but I have a question for you
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your concerns and
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely I what Madame chair said is
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
100% right none of us want to be making
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
people who have disabilities go through
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of hoop that doesn't exist for
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
anyone else because that creates a bad
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
dichotomy that we don't want in our
 
02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
society but what I'm wondering is would
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
the disability rights organization be
 
02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:32.069 align:start position:0%
the disability rights organization be
open

02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:06:34.589 --> 02:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
to would their opposition be removed
 
02:06:37.149 --> 02:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
from this bill or maybe even support a
 
02:06:40.589 --> 02:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
study committee on this issue given the
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
what businesses are coming before and
 
02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
saying to representatives and others
 
02:06:47.709 --> 02:06:47.719 align:start position:0%
about the chaos that they're facing even
 
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
if that study committee ends up being
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
the result of which we talk about
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
maybe training programs for these
 
02:06:59.830 --> 02:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
businesses and police officers to better
 
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
know the Ada or something along those
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
lines but do you think it would be a
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
good idea to beyond the hour that we
 
02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
have here today take a look at this
 
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
issue as a state in a study committee it
 
02:07:12.549 --> 02:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
sounds like people have concerns I don't
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
see us objecting to a study committee
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
just please don't put me on
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
it un spread you thinly but it would
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:25.950 --> 02:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
um I you know it sounds like there are
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
some concerns and there could and I
 
02:07:31.149 --> 02:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
could see um you know you can't dictate
 
02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
what a study committee is going to
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
conclude right um but if a study
 
02:07:38.589 --> 02:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
committee thinks that it would be
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to consider training on Ada
 
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't see the harm of having people
 
02:07:48.189 --> 02:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
being more educated about the Ada right
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't so I I don't you know
 
02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
if this if the study committee came out
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
with a recommendation that um you know
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
we charge everyone five dollars to bring
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
their service dog into a facility you
 
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
know of course we would object to that
 
02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:03.629 align:start position:0%
know of course we would object to that
um

02:08:03.629 --> 02:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:07.149 --> 02:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
but yeah have at it representative
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you madam chair and and
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this valuable
 
02:08:13.149 --> 02:08:13.159 align:start position:0%
Insight do you have a copy of the
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
legislation uh I do uh the only question
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is you said you felt it
 
02:08:20.549 --> 02:08:20.559 align:start position:0%
violated the Americans with disability
 
02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:22.030 align:start position:0%
violated the Americans with disability
Acts

02:08:22.030 --> 02:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
Acts
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
could you please if you can um tell me
 
02:08:26.430 --> 02:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
which one of the specific questions that
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
are being asked do you consider to be a
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
violation of that act well first
 
02:08:33.470 --> 02:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
requiring a form at all would violate
 
02:08:36.669 --> 02:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
the a because that's documentation and
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
public accommodations are prohibited
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
from requiring
 
02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
documentation right that would okay was
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
this may I follow up please sure thank
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
you because it seemed like the form had
 
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
had everything to do with the animal and
 
02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
not the person
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
so I didn't know if that actually would
 
02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
be a violation yeah requiring any kind
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
of documentation would would prohibit
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
the Ada because you can't require
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
documentation about the animal about and
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
and or and also it exceeds the questions
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
that you could ask so the name of the
 
02:09:12.669 --> 02:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
service animal the name of the service
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
animal's owner um the state in which the
 
02:09:19.629 --> 02:09:19.639 align:start position:0%
animals registered um the function is
 
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
performed you can ask this orally but it
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's you're not allowed to require
 
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
documentation so um I'm just looking to
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
see what then there's a notation of
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
information um in a place to sign like
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
forcing someone to sign a document to
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
enter a restaurant when no one else is
 
02:09:37.950 --> 02:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
required to sign a document when they
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
enter a restaurant would also violate
 
02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
just the
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
Ada thank you okay representative Penza
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then Bixby and then H Haskins uh
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question you're testimony was
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
great um in regards with the 167 d10 um
 
02:10:00.510 --> 02:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
and where you mentioned the misdemeanors
 
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
there was I don't know um a little bit
 
02:10:05.310 --> 02:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
of conversation in regards with you know
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
an education piece um and I think that's
 
02:10:10.830 --> 02:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
clear this is no one would ever of
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
course want to one question someone that
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
um you know has a service animal or any
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
of those types of things or put um
 
02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
anybody in that kind of situation in
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:10:25.390 --> 02:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
um as we said earlier
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
um um agrees with that statement
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
but it's such an uncomfortable situation
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
for um everyone involved a business
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
owner uh so I mean to me whenever
 
02:10:41.549 --> 02:10:41.559 align:start position:0%
there's these uncons you know
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable situations education to me
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
is key but even for like our law
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement um folks or whatever to kind
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
of understand that I
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
I just I think if people understood the
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
laws and that there was a misdemeanor
 
02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.599 align:start position:0%
but how you would go about that is what
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
where to me is kind of like a gray area
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying you're going to know
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
how somebody would go about saying okay
 
02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
this animal came into my restaurant
 
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
create created a problem they didn't
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
want to leave like anything like those
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
types of situations and I just in
 
02:11:19.629 --> 02:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
calling law enforcement in puts them in
 
02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
a you know they don't want to be as if
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
the bad guy against you know the person
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
that has a dis it's just all of the
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
Optics stink like if you I'm asking you
 
02:11:31.709 --> 02:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
multiple questions in here is is there a
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
question yes so like how would you go
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
about saying okay you know we want to
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
you know enforce 167 d10 like the like I
 
02:11:42.549 --> 02:11:42.559 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I don't know that I
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
have all the answers but when you were
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
talking about how awkward it is for
 
02:11:48.549 --> 02:11:48.559 align:start position:0%
public accommodations I was thinking
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
about how awkward it is for restaurants
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
or bars when someone is intoxicated yeah
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
and they have to ask them to leave right
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
or someone is having some other kind of
 
02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
Crisis or they are just acting
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
incredibly rudely and there are times
 
02:12:06.430 --> 02:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
when those owners those business owners
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
have to ask people to leave and it is
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
about training um and in a previous life
 
02:12:14.350 --> 02:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
when I was really young I volunteered at
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
a dropin center where um they served
 
02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
people who were homeless this was in
 
02:12:20.430 --> 02:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
Boston people who were homeless people
 
02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
who had um different kinds of
 
02:12:25.709 --> 02:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
psychiatric issues and we got training
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
to deal with people we had some pretty
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
violent clients sometimes and um and
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
that training was really helpful when I
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
was you know with one other person and
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
had to kick out someone who was you know
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
basically threatening me and you know I
 
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
my younger self was able to learn how to
 
02:12:44.910 --> 02:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
do it and got rid of you know got him to
 
02:12:47.910 --> 02:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
leave in a calm way with a calm voice
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
and you know then he proceeded to throw
 
02:12:50.750 --> 02:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
rocks at the building but at least but
 
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
after lock the door so I think that
 
02:12:56.669 --> 02:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
there is training that can be done but
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard it's scary and it's and
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
it's difficult but it can be done
 
02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:02.629 align:start position:0%
it's difficult but it can be done
representative

02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so um I'm a I'm a little bit
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
unclear about what you whether there are
 
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
actually any um requirements for what
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
makes a service animal and is there any
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
required training for service animals is
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
there anything that uh can you just say
 
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
this is a service animal and then it's a
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
service animal well it needs to be
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
trained to you need to have you need the
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
service animal or one would need it
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
because of the disability and it needs
 
02:13:36.669 --> 02:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
to be trained to perform a task but
 
02:13:40.549 --> 02:13:40.559 align:start position:0%
there's not like a requirement that Acme
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
Service Agency train a particular
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
service animal because the thing is
 
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
disability is really wide ranging
 
02:13:48.990 --> 02:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
there's all different kinds of
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities and all different kinds of
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
needs that someone might have as a
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
result of a disability and all different
 
02:13:57.830 --> 02:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of training that might be required
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
um because someone has a disability so
 
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
like for someone who is um is blind or
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
has low vision like the service animal
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
that they would require would need very
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
specific training for that purpose right
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
someone who needs a service animal
 
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
because they have a seizure disorder and
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
the service animal is detecting you know
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
whether they might be about to have a
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
seizure and is alerting them to that
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
would have very different training so so
 
02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
there's so I think maybe that's why but
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
there isn't there there's nothing
 
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
prescribed specifically which I know is
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
kind of what you want but it's not
 
02:14:38.109 --> 02:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
really there right so given that uh is
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
there any way to actually enforce uh 167
 
02:14:47.149 --> 02:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
d8 or 16767 d10 well I
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
think I think the place where it would
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
be enforcable would be where the animal
 
02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
is not under under the control of the
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
person and is acting inappropriately is
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
probably where as a practical matter a a
 
02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
public accommodation would have the
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
greatest likelihood of success because
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
they could ask the two questions like
 
02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
situation human nature isn't always the
 
02:15:13.149 --> 02:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
best nature people could misrepresent I
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
mean we'd hope that they wouldn't but if
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
they persisted in misrepresenting the
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
nature of the animal they brought into
 
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
the accommodation and that animal was
 
02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
totally well behaved I think it would be
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
really difficult I I think it would be
 
02:15:27.229 --> 02:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
unrealistic probably to expect that law
 
02:15:28.750 --> 02:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement's going to do anything about
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
it I I I I you know I wish I had a
 
02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
different answer for you representative
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
H Haskins and then representative King
 
02:15:39.069 --> 02:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
we're running a time here thank you for
 
02:15:41.549 --> 02:15:41.559 align:start position:0%
testifying today I'm intrigued by the
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
second question I was only aware that
 
02:15:47.470 --> 02:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
you could ask someone if that is a
 
02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
service dog but does the disability
 
02:15:54.149 --> 02:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
rights Community are they comfortable
 
02:15:57.310 --> 02:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
with asking somebody to describe the
 
02:16:01.549 --> 02:16:01.559 align:start position:0%
nature of the task which leads to the
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
disability I I don't know whether I I
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
can't you know the the dis there's not
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
really like a disability rights
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
Community monolith right people have
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
different feelings about this but what I
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that the law permits it
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay whether they're comfortable or not
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
the law permits this question to be
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
asked followup Madam chair followup yeah
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
so if someone were to say there's a
 
02:16:26.430 --> 02:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
whole panoply of
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
psychiatric um disabilities and so if
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
someone says because the the phrase
 
02:16:36.150 --> 02:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
Comfort dog has come up today um if
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
someone says that uh the task is
 
02:16:45.830 --> 02:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
Comfort because an anxiety disorder
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
might benefit
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
having a service dog so so this is a
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
really interesting question to untangle
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
first Comfort
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
animals um who are just kind of they're
 
02:17:03.150 --> 02:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
just animals that aren't really trained
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
they just make you feel better are not
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
protected right so they so although um
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
under the Fair Housing Act someone who
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
is a a tenant or wants to move into a
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
condominium or something like that could
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
have a comfort animal as an
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
accommodation under the fair housing act
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
that is not um recognized under the Ada
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
so that would not that that a comfort
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
animal is just an animal that makes you
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
feel better right and and but if but if
 
02:17:33.070 --> 02:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
you had anxiety you don't have to
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
disclose you have anxiety but if the
 
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
task of the um an I'm trying to you know
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
the animals is performing a task maybe
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
for the person who has anxiety who has a
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
service animal maybe the service that
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
that animal provides is reminding like
 
02:17:49.469 --> 02:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
giving them a nudge they remember to
 
02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
take their medication or it it may it
 
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
may have some other function that is
 
02:17:56.190 --> 02:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
that they really needed training for but
 
02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
they still are no under no obligation to
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
tell a public accommodation what their
 
02:18:03.709 --> 02:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
disability is okay thank you
 
02:18:03.719 --> 02:18:05.030 align:start position:0%
disability is okay thank you
representative

02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:08.669 --> 02:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair um is it
 
02:18:10.830 --> 02:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
legally allowed for an establishment to
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
refuse um all dogs for period you can't
 
02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
they could refuse not you can't refuse
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
service animals there's there's no
 
02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
establishment whatsoever what what if
 
02:18:24.190 --> 02:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
it's like a swimming pool and the
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
service animal swims the person back and
 
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
forth across the lanes like I think that
 
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
um I mean do you have to allow a service
 
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
animal in the pool too so it can carry
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
the person back and forth I I just there
 
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
has to be limits somewhere there are
 
02:18:42.910 --> 02:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
like well like a hotel for example could
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
have an area where um you know if people
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
have are allergic to animals that you
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
could have an area of the hotel like you
 
02:18:52.830 --> 02:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
could you could have an area that would
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
allow someone because you could have
 
02:18:56.429 --> 02:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
conflicting disabilities right or
 
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
conflicting situations where the animal
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
is not required as long as you basically
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
made the animal available everywhere
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
else um so I your question about the
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
pool um I I just don't know off the top
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
of my head I think I'd D on the side of
 
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
caution and let the you know unless
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
there's some reason for the animal not
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
to be there that would cause a f the the
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
other guard is fundamental alteration so
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
if if requiring um an accommodation
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
would be a fundamental alteration of the
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
public accommodation purpose or C cause
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
an undue burden then that would be a
 
02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
limit um and I haven't really thought I
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
would really need to think through the
 
02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
swimming pool issue okay thank you any
 
02:19:44.750 --> 02:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:46.349 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
representative

02:19:46.349 --> 02:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
Kenny yes thank you um I just wanted to
 
02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:51.230 align:start position:0%
Kenny yes thank you um I just wanted to
know

02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:19:54.190 --> 02:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
um if someone when it when someone gets
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
a dog that's supposed to be helping them
 
02:20:00.349 --> 02:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
do would they then get upset that other
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
people were bringing dogs in that would
 
02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
not be I mean I can't imagine being a
 
02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
handicapped person and waiting for that
 
02:20:12.590 --> 02:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
dog and loving that dog then someone
 
02:20:16.750 --> 02:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
else walks in that doesn't have that
 
02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
same connection and they're just playing
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
it why there isn't something that can be
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
done no I mean I I think that is an
 
02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
issue that I've that some people with
 
02:20:31.270 --> 02:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities feeli like you know that
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know when they're that there could
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
be people who you know don't need the
 
02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
you know especially if their animals are
 
02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
disruptive and they are doing something
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
you know that might disrupt their
 
02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
service animal I'm sure I can understand
 
02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
how that could be an issue but by the
 
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
same token this the Ada was enacted to
 
02:20:51.990 --> 02:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
protect this group group of people and
 
02:20:55.150 --> 02:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be and and you know and we
 
02:20:57.870 --> 02:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
need to be careful that any legislation
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't conflict with that or you know
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
even though some people might get away
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
with something but they
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't hey just a quick yes or no
 
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
question notice that says it is illegal
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
to misrepresent a pet as a service
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
animal with fines up to $1,200 would it
 
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
be out of bounds to um if you suspect
 
02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
that an animal is does is not a service
 
02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
animal to just point to the sign and say
 
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
say I'd like to remind you or are you
 
02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:32.950 align:start position:0%
say I'd like to remind you or are you
aware

02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
aware
 
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
um well I think it's I think that there
 
02:21:38.910 --> 02:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
might be some risk you know we live in a
 
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
very litigious Society right so um and I
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
am a lawyer but um I think that you know
 
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
there might be some concern about about
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
that the limits yeah so I don't know
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
that might be a little bit risky but
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen businesses regularly um you
 
02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
know like where I go grocery shopping
 
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
they have a sign right at the front door
 
02:22:02.110 --> 02:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
and there's like a local restaurant I
 
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
like to go to that has it on their
 
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
website so there are a lot of ways that
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
businesses get the word out there um so
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
it might be you know depending how it
 
02:22:13.510 --> 02:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
comes down if it's if it's a person
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
who's you know gaming it and they get
 
02:22:17.230 --> 02:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
this notice then they probably don't
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
have if they you know they would be hard
 
02:22:21.309 --> 02:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
pressed to bring a discrimination
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
complaint right but if if the um
 
02:22:26.429 --> 02:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
accommodation um owner was wrong about
 
02:22:29.710 --> 02:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
that then um yeah they might be opening
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
themselves up to some liability okay
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you okay any other
 
02:22:39.389 --> 02:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
questions we have one last person so I
 
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
don't know uh we would be cutting into
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
our lunchtime and I I hope that that
 
02:22:44.910 --> 02:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
would be okay with everybody otherwise
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%

02:23:17.550 --> 02:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
state agency um right within the
 
02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
organizational structure of the state
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
within the governor's office
 
02:23:23.389 --> 02:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
um we are all about education and
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
resource uh and really the Integrity of
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%

questions that you're asking today this
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
was a very robust discussion and these
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
are the questions that we see on a
 
02:23:39.550 --> 02:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
regular basis uh that uh come into our
 
02:23:42.429 --> 02:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
office as it relates to service animals
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time you know I I
 
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
think you all have a pretty good grasp
 
02:23:50.110 --> 02:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
you you have ada.gov in your possession
 
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
you have the decal which is so that
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
decal goes back to about four years ago
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
maybe six years ago a couple of few
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions ago so that's
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
actually statutory where the legislature
 
02:24:02.110 --> 02:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
decided that the governance Commission
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
on disability and Secretary of State's
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
office sh shall work together and
 
02:24:09.469 --> 02:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
produce that decal that businesses can
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
now post um as it relates to the
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation um of service animals
 
02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
so I I offer the services of the
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%

as you move forward with this um we're
 
02:24:24.429 --> 02:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
very acclimated to the Ada I'm not
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill because
 
02:24:28.750 --> 02:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
of our position in state government you
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
are all the policy makers however we we
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
do sit as a resource should this go into
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
work sessions should this go um into a
 
02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:37.950 align:start position:0%
work sessions should this go um into a
study

02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:24:40.910 --> 02:24:40.920 align:start position:0%

02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we are trying to address the
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
problem and it is a real problem of um
 
02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
of people who are misusing abusing this
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
privilege and um and causing problems uh
 
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
so so I I since you are you know one of
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
the experts here what would be your
 
02:25:28.349 --> 02:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
advice in terms of the the direction
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
that we should pursue yeah it it's a
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's a great question um and again I
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
applaud all of you because what I hear
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
you you are upholding the Integrity of
 
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
the Ada and and in the same breath you
 
02:25:42.870 --> 02:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
are looking at what can we do because if
 
02:25:44.670 --> 02:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
you are an individual with a disability
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
and you have a service animal and you
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
have the fake that's coming into the
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
same um establishment
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
there is a the individual with a
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
disability wants their rights upheld
 
02:25:58.590 --> 02:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
because they're entitled to that um
 
02:26:00.670 --> 02:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
legitimately again the discussions that
 
02:26:02.590 --> 02:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
happened today it really does go back to
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
the Americans with Disabilities Act um
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's very it it tells us in so many
 
02:26:13.309 --> 02:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
words uh if it's not obvious that it is
 
02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
a service animal then you can ask the
 
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
two questions and that's federal law and
 
02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
as you all know state law can't do
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
anything to hamper federal law so
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
therein lies it's I mean when you look
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
even myself how and I have to tell you
 
02:26:31.070 --> 02:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
because you all have great questions and
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
the question regarding the support
 
02:26:35.309 --> 02:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
animal emotional support or
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
companion there are many times when the
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
call comes into our office and there are
 
02:26:42.269 --> 02:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
times when I am dealing with the citizen
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
um in conjunction with my staff there
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
two members of the staff here with me
 
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
today it's not an answer they want to
 
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
hear but because of the Ada it depends
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
it depends and and that is because when
 
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
we're going back to federal law that's
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
what we're driven by and there sometimes
 
02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
isn't a cut and dry if the animal is
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
trained to perform a the dog because
 
02:27:09.309 --> 02:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
you're right service animal equals dog
 
02:27:13.349 --> 02:27:13.359 align:start position:0%
the doj federal has um opined that
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
miniature hes also F fit within that
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
category we never see that so the
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
one the peacock loud I'm sorry no that's
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
okay the peacock the boa constrictor we
 
02:27:28.990 --> 02:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen it in the news and at the
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
airports that is not a service animal so
 
02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
the service animal is a dog um that is
 
02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
required because of the disability and
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
is individually trained so in that
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
instance with the Comfort animal if it
 
02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
is it a comfort but if it's trained to
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
perform a task for the individual with a
 
02:27:47.950 --> 02:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
disability now we are looking at service
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
animal um there are recent legislation I
 
02:27:54.030 --> 02:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
think it was maybe last session or the
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
session before there was an addition
 
02:27:59.110 --> 02:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
that if a um dog performs the task of
 
02:28:02.750 --> 02:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
alerting an individual with diabetes
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
that they have to
 
02:28:06.190 --> 02:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
maintain that's service anim that
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
service animal can be held by the um
 
02:28:10.269 --> 02:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
individual with a disability because it
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
has to smell the breath that's typically
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
where where the the low blood sugar so
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
there in there in lies the issue um I
 
02:28:20.349 --> 02:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
you know Karen had referenced if a dog
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
is not under the Handler's control
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's when the business can take the
 
02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
action and I sincerely mean this I don't
 
02:28:28.590 --> 02:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
mean this as a cliche I think the the
 
02:28:30.910 --> 02:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and its infinite wisdom and
 
02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
obviously as signed by the governor with
 
02:28:35.389 --> 02:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
that decal that's that's what I think
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
we're all trying to do is is to limit
 
02:28:39.630 --> 02:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
the misrepresentation and The Fakes that
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
are out there because that does hurt the
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
Ada and and it does cut right into
 
02:28:45.710 --> 02:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
individuals with a disability that that
 
02:28:48.429 --> 02:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
basically have full access um with their
 
02:28:51.990 --> 02:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
dog um in a doesn't have to be doesn't
 
02:28:54.070 --> 02:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
have to go to a training school um and I
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
think you've heard that typically
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who are blind will have the
 
02:29:02.349 --> 02:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
guide dog and that is in that is trained
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
I mean I've heard don't quote me please
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
but they're into the five figures of 20
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
$30,000 uh for the training and it's an
 
02:29:13.389 --> 02:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
exhaustive very intense training with
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
the owner in the dog um and there were a
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
few schools uh that that do that but
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
other than that because we have to look
 
02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
because we're Guided by the Ada that's
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
what guides um the
 
02:29:30.030 --> 02:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh representative Bixby
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that um we've covered an
 
02:29:36.269 --> 02:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
awful lot of territory and I think that
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
what we're coming down to is do we make
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
this a committee a study committee or uh
 
02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
is is there any hope of coming up with
 
02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
something in a study committee that uh
 
02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:50.870 align:start position:0%
something in a study committee that uh
and

02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:54.429 --> 02:29:54.439 align:start position:0%
and or or basically are all the options
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
that are available already out there and
 
02:29:58.990 --> 02:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
we would be spending a lot a bunch of
 
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
time not getting anywhere with the study
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
committee yeah it it's
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
a it's a very OnPoint question and
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
comment quite honestly um if we have to
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
revert back to the Ada I because even
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
this statute uh the propos excuse me the
 
02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
proposed bill when I read it um it did
 
02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:18.680 align:start position:0%
say consistent with federal law in in
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
the uh introductory
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
sentences that is how we're driven we're
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're driven by the federal law on
 
02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:25.870 align:start position:0%
we're we're driven by the federal law on
this

02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:30:28.349 --> 02:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
one so
 
02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
essentially we don't there's not a lot
 
02:30:32.710 --> 02:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
we can do at the state level and we
 
02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
might not it might not make sense to to
 
02:30:38.070 --> 02:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
spend time studying it I with all du
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
respect I can't give that opinion to you
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay yes and I apologize for that
 
02:30:45.269 --> 02:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
represent Scully thank you madam cheer a
 
02:30:48.190 --> 02:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
quick question I promise um in your
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
opinion is requesting a somebody
 
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
certified that their dog is a service
 
02:30:55.309 --> 02:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
animal a violation of the
 
02:30:59.150 --> 02:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
Ada my my understanding is when I review
 
02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
um again ada.gov
 
02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:02.790 align:start position:0%
um again ada.gov
um

02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
certification vests
 
02:31:08.830 --> 02:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
licenses are not re are not mandated by
 
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
the Ada so we we see the vest they're on
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
Amazon they're everywhere the vest means
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
nothing it doesn't mean it's a service
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
animal so the the vest any type of
 
02:31:20.349 --> 02:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
certification National Registry we've
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
had these
 
02:31:23.710 --> 02:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
discussions that that it doesn't exist
 
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
so you couldn't go into a database and
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
say hey is this a service animal it
 
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist I'm just really stumped by
 
02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
the fact that we can do that with cars
 
02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
and tags on the cars but we can't do
 
02:31:37.269 --> 02:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
that with service animals and you know I
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that's my my thing
 
02:31:41.510 --> 02:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
represent Penza and you'd think that the
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
government would be all over this type
 
02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
of level of control because they love to
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
control everything else so um I have a
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
real quick question and has to do with
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
the notice um is there um I know that
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
you the commission has been amazing
 
02:32:00.750 --> 02:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
underneath uh the the governor um I know
 
02:32:01.950 --> 02:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of the work that you guys have
 
02:32:04.510 --> 02:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
done so is it h how's this whole process
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
work is it um you know our our
 
02:32:10.950 --> 02:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
businesses getting regular information
 
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
from you guys yearly maybe when they're
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
paying their taxes renewing whatever
 
02:32:18.469 --> 02:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
like I was just going to say you know
 
02:32:21.550 --> 02:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
education is key and so I think that
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
this type of um of information is is
 
02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
really great and can help business
 
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
owners and um and then my other question
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
is um in regards with I'm a business
 
02:32:34.670 --> 02:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
owner I don't even want to get into that
 
02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
you know welcome into my store whatever
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
it may be hey just wanted to make sure
 
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
like I'm not going to even ask them
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
they've got their dog or whatever just
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know make you familiar of
 
02:32:47.429 --> 02:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
the notice do you think that that is um
 
02:32:49.230 --> 02:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
you know a problem for a business owner
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
to to you know just say hey just wanted
 
02:32:55.670 --> 02:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
you to be aware of the law that's it
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
like you know telling someone the U you
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
know here's the law I don't understand
 
02:33:03.790 --> 02:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
how that could be against the
 
02:33:06.990 --> 02:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
law so um you had two questions uh the
 
02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
first question is um that notice um is
 
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
housed on the Secretary of State's
 
02:33:15.269 --> 02:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
website um both as a a downloadable
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
where a business can download them or if
 
02:33:20.110 --> 02:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken business owners even
 
02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
request hard copies from the secretary
 
02:33:23.830 --> 02:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
state's office and I think it's in the
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
corporate Division I think I'm not sure
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
we also make it available uh there's
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
links on our website gcds governance
 
02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability website to get
 
02:33:35.269 --> 02:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
that um notice um we also at the
 
02:33:36.990 --> 02:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
governance Commission on disability I
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
have very robust social media campaign
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
very very um very robust on fa Facebook
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
um we have posted that many times to do
 
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
the best we can to get that information
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
out when a business owner contacts the
 
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
gcd and speaks to the team we ensure
 
02:33:55.389 --> 02:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
that they're aware um of that notice to
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
at least that they can post it to a
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
second question I'm not sure if and with
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
all du respect I I don't know if that
 
02:34:06.510 --> 02:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
Karen had reference would that
 
02:34:08.670 --> 02:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
potentially open up to litigation I I
 
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
think that's where you were going I I
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know but I understand
 
02:34:14.469 --> 02:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
where the question is coming from I just
 
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't know okay okay any other questions
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate you
 
02:34:22.349 --> 02:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
coming in and um and explaining some
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
things further and um we will probably
 
02:34:28.110 --> 02:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
be talking to you or I don't know well
 
02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
we look forward to it it's definitely an
 
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
active discussion as you can tell yes
 
02:34:33.710 --> 02:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to ask for the blue
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
sheet for uh HB 424 unless anybody else
 
02:34:38.429 --> 02:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
wants to say
 
02:34:40.830 --> 02:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
anything I think we're good okay thank
 
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
you uh yeah I'm going to uh the online
 
02:34:47.590 --> 02:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh testimony we had seven people in
 
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
support seven people in opposition one
 
02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:51.269 align:start position:0%
support seven people in opposition one
person

02:34:51.269 --> 02:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
sheet we had one person in support and
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
against and with that I'm going to close
 
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
out the um hearing for HB 424 and we
 
02:35:16.110 --> 02:35:16.120 align:start position:0%

02:35:33.309 --> 02:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
with I mean that would be the
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
absolute um solution is to get a tag for
 
02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:48.630 align:start position:0%

03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
time to do a presentation from council
 
03:31:10.389 --> 03:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
state governments the a people and um so
 
03:31:12.110 --> 03:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
I I'll try and see if we can't schedule
 
03:31:13.469 --> 03:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
them to come at
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
11:00 so that'll be for Tuesday March 8
 
03:31:17.870 --> 03:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
18th and then we won't see each other
 
03:31:21.349 --> 03:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
until after we get Senate bills so we
 
03:31:25.790 --> 03:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:29.269 --> 03:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
breather well crossover is April 10th
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay so anytime after that I'm sure
 
03:31:33.510 --> 03:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
we'll start getting some bills I don't I
 
03:31:35.590 --> 03:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't haven't really looked at what the
 
03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
Senate bills are or how many there are
 
03:31:41.550 --> 03:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
but normally we get something like five
 
03:31:44.349 --> 03:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
six seven something something around
 
03:31:48.030 --> 03:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
there sometimes just one or two then
 
03:31:51.790 --> 03:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
again given how used to be that we had
 
03:31:54.510 --> 03:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
like a dozen house bills and now we're
 
03:31:58.950 --> 03:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
up to like almost three dozen yeah yeah
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
we do have there is the advantage that
 
03:32:02.830 --> 03:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate does kill a certain number
 
03:32:02.840 --> 03:32:03.910 align:start position:0%
the Senate does kill a certain number
they

03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:32:06.269 --> 03:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
come yeah that's just to hope they don't
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:18.269 --> 03:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.429 --> 03:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
is high range
 
03:32:22.309 --> 03:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
roond high
 
03:32:25.630 --> 03:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
range yeah High Range
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%

representative Peter B
 
03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh straford 133
 
03:33:22.550 --> 03:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
do and uh I here to
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
introduce uh HB 262 FN relative to group
 
03:33:31.830 --> 03:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
licenses for dogs and what this bill
 
03:33:36.110 --> 03:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
seems to do is change the definition of
 
03:33:39.510 --> 03:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
how many dogs can be held under a group
 
03:33:44.469 --> 03:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
license and uh changes the fees uh for
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
group license
 
03:33:46.319 --> 03:33:48.269 align:start position:0%
group license
and

03:33:48.269 --> 03:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:53.150 --> 03:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh makes a provision for dogs in in
 
03:33:56.790 --> 03:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
excess of a maximum for how the fees are
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
handled for
 
03:34:01.349 --> 03:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
those and make some restrictions about
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
whether you can uh ex change change the
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
number of dogs you have before shortly
 
03:34:08.479 --> 03:34:09.429 align:start position:0%
number of dogs you have before shortly
before

03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:34:09.439 --> 03:34:11.269 align:start position:0%
before
licensing

03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
03:34:11.279 --> 03:34:12.910 align:start position:0%
licensing
um

03:34:12.910 --> 03:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
and uh there is
 
03:34:20.590 --> 03:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh one issue that has that comes up with
 
03:34:24.990 --> 03:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
group licensing is that uh once you get
 
03:34:28.030 --> 03:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
over if you have one two or three dogs
 
03:34:30.990 --> 03:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
you don't qualify for group licensing
 
03:34:33.229 --> 03:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
but if you have or I I think you have to
 
03:34:36.830 --> 03:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
have at least five under current law and
 
03:34:39.750 --> 03:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
if you have four dogs then you're paying
 
03:34:42.030 --> 03:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
more in licensing than you would if you
 
03:34:45.429 --> 03:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
had 40 dogs so I think that's probably
 
03:34:47.590 --> 03:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
the reason the bill was brought in I
 
03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
don't know if the bill manages to do
 
03:34:52.030 --> 03:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
anything effective about
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you so much for for that
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
um and before uh I I don't have any pink
 
03:35:04.469 --> 03:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
cards up here for this
 
03:35:04.479 --> 03:35:06.830 align:start position:0%
cards up here for this
bill

03:35:06.830 --> 03:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:35:10.269 --> 03:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
so but before I call anybody up I do
 
03:35:14.189 --> 03:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
want to alert uh the committee
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
to uh cour respondence that I received
 
03:35:22.870 --> 03:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
an email from uh let's see uh Diane
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
Richardson from working class
 
03:35:28.590 --> 03:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
K9 uh she sent the email to me Barbara
 
03:35:31.790 --> 03:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
ktoa Kathy Kenny I believe the entire
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh and also cced Mike bordes
 
03:35:37.309 --> 03:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
saying that the we would be hearing
 
03:35:38.910 --> 03:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
testimony for this regarding group
 
03:35:40.790 --> 03:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
licenses the bill is introduced is
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
completely unworkable in the words of
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
her town
 
03:35:47.150 --> 03:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
clerk I'm I won't say that what the heck
 
03:35:50.670 --> 03:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
is this um as introduced it is a
 
03:35:52.990 --> 03:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
nightmare for both clerks and dog dog
 
03:35:54.990 --> 03:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
owners however in cooperation with my
 
03:35:57.150 --> 03:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
town clerk and the sponsor we reworked
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
the bill and sponsor rep bordes will be
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
introducing this
 
03:36:03.750 --> 03:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
amendment uh it changes the whole bill
 
03:36:06.790 --> 03:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
fee structure and eliminates section uh
 
03:36:09.309 --> 03:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 4A which should would
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
mandate puppies as be rabies vaccinated
 
03:36:14.590 --> 03:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
and licensed before transfer and no one
 
03:36:17.150 --> 03:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
is keeping litters till 12 weeks to do
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
so minimum legal rabies vaccine age is
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
12 weeks in New Hampshire older in many
 
03:36:24.189 --> 03:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
other states as you may guess I fully
 
03:36:25.950 --> 03:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
support the amendment as it will enable
 
03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
towns to stop losing money on group
 
03:36:30.910 --> 03:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
licenses currently group licenses are
 
03:36:35.070 --> 03:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
$20 for five plus dogs regardless of how
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
many group licenses are definitely
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to incentivize those
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
with numbers of dogs to license and
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccinate their dogs affordably
 
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
I feel this amendment is a solid
 
03:36:50.429 --> 03:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
compromise individual spay neuter
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
licenses are 650 each intact licenses
 
03:36:56.510 --> 03:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
are 950 so the dollar savings are still
 
03:36:58.429 --> 03:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
there for owners with six plus spayed
 
03:37:02.189 --> 03:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
neutered or five plus intact dogs I have
 
03:37:06.070 --> 03:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
not seen any amendment I don't I don't
 
03:37:09.309 --> 03:37:09.319 align:start position:0%
know anything but I did want to alert
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%

03:37:14.429 --> 03:37:14.439 align:start position:0%

03:37:16.510 --> 03:37:16.520 align:start position:0%

this bill so um New Hampshire dogs
 
03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill because it it it
 
03:38:02.110 --> 03:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
appears to be targeting a subset of the
 
03:38:05.550 --> 03:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
population for increased taxes um in
 
03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
specific dog
 
03:38:09.229 --> 03:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
owners many people have five or more
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
dogs they love the their animals they
 
03:38:15.870 --> 03:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
they take in shelter dogs that kinds of
 
03:38:18.750 --> 03:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
thing um and to Target them to increase
 
03:38:21.189 --> 03:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with keeping those
 
03:38:23.950 --> 03:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
animals is is inappropriate it it should
 
03:38:23.960 --> 03:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
animals is is inappropriate it it should
be

03:38:25.510 --> 03:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:38:28.550 --> 03:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
um costed across the board for all
 
03:38:32.269 --> 03:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
citizens within the state
 
03:38:35.670 --> 03:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
um the original purpose for licensing
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
was to uh have
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
rabies watched by the town people to
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
make sure the dogs are vaccinated we
 
03:38:46.110 --> 03:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
could eliminate the rabies issue etc etc
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
the that
 
03:38:53.309 --> 03:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't parts of this bill do not do
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
anything to serve that particular
 
03:38:58.750 --> 03:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
purpose and in specific having licensed
 
03:39:01.630 --> 03:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
puppies at six weeks of age uh does
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
nothing to further the rabies
 
03:39:06.110 --> 03:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination because they can't be
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and then if they're going to
 
03:39:11.389 --> 03:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
be released to a new home at the 8 weeks
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
of age it seems absolutely ridiculous to
 
03:39:16.550 --> 03:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
have them licensed for a twoe period of
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
time and it frankly looks just like a
 
03:39:22.510 --> 03:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
money grab you know it's it's not it's
 
03:39:26.670 --> 03:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
not fair it's targeting breeders um and
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
and dogs necessarily opposes
 
03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
that um it as far as costs are concerned
 
03:39:37.469 --> 03:39:37.479 align:start position:0%
my my own town of Epsom we don't have an
 
03:39:40.150 --> 03:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
animal control officer we're not paying
 
03:39:43.550 --> 03:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
anybody any additional fees for anything
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
if a neighbor's dog gets Lo and that
 
03:39:48.150 --> 03:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
happens a lot we have a community page
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
on Facebook and we reach out hey my dog
 
03:39:52.990 --> 03:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
is missing the gate got opened can you
 
03:39:55.150 --> 03:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
guys keep your eyes out two or three
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
posts later oh he's over here on Orchard
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
Road and um and Zippity Do they come
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
over they pick up the dog and bring them
 
03:40:04.189 --> 03:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
home and our neighbors are fabulous when
 
03:40:06.150 --> 03:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
it comes to that we we don't have an
 
03:40:07.990 --> 03:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
animal control officer we don't really
 
03:40:11.150 --> 03:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
have increased costs with regard to the
 
03:40:13.469 --> 03:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
dog ownership in our town and I'm sure
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
that there are many towns within the
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire that have that as
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
well um it's what 88 cents for printer
 
03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
to print out the license for a dog now I
 
03:40:25.870 --> 03:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how
 
03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
many households have more than 20 dogs
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that it's a lot of
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
animals but it could happen and I'm I'm
 
03:40:37.150 --> 03:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
just not aware of them um but still it's
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
ink for the printer it's a minimal
 
03:40:43.950 --> 03:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
amount for a tag um and and and as I
 
03:40:45.790 --> 03:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
understand it there are many towns that
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
don't actually issue the individual tag
 
03:40:48.990 --> 03:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
for the dogs they just give the group
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
license and walk on
 
03:40:56.429 --> 03:40:56.439 align:start position:0%
so with that we are opposed to this bill
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um I I'd like to ask you
 
03:41:03.790 --> 03:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
if you think the way the current statute
 
03:41:06.630 --> 03:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
is written if you feel that there's any
 
03:41:08.349 --> 03:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
03:41:13.150 --> 03:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
it the fee structure or anything else I
 
03:41:14.910 --> 03:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see a problem with it
 
03:41:17.630 --> 03:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
no okay um I mean if they were to if
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
they were to change the fee structure I
 
03:41:21.790 --> 03:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
think we'd probably consider not
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
opposing that but again it there's not
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
really any increased cost to the town to
 
03:41:29.990 --> 03:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
have the number of dogs okay thank you
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you for
 
03:41:37.710 --> 03:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
coming to speak with us this afternoon
 
03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
for listening is there anybody else who
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on this bill and uh
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative King
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.429 --> 03:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:04.149 --> 03:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
Kelly okay anybody else wish to speak on
 
03:42:04.159 --> 03:42:05.670 align:start position:0%
Kelly okay anybody else wish to speak on
this

03:42:05.670 --> 03:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:42:10.510 --> 03:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill no um I I do also want to say I I
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
picked up um a testimony from Nancy
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
Holmes that was on the portal I'm just
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
trying to give us some more information
 
03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
about this um from New Boston uh she
 
03:42:24.149 --> 03:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
opposes HB
 
03:42:26.309 --> 03:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
262 um there's a reason for the
 
03:42:28.030 --> 03:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
existence of the group license and for
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
its relatively low fee much like the
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
lowcost rabies clinics run at the
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
expense of some of our local
 
03:42:37.269 --> 03:42:37.279 align:start position:0%
veterinarians the group license is
 
03:42:39.469 --> 03:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
designed to encourage owners of multip
 
03:42:42.030 --> 03:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
dogs to vaccinate their dogs against
 
03:42:44.630 --> 03:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
rabies this vaccination is a requirement
 
03:42:47.309 --> 03:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
of dog Licensing in our state indeed
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
veterinarians must report administering
 
03:42:53.229 --> 03:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
rabies vacines to the town where the
 
03:42:55.830 --> 03:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
owner of the vaccinated dog resides ra
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
raising licensing rates and making tiers
 
03:43:02.189 --> 03:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
of registration with increasing rates
 
03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
are all actions apt to reduce rabies
 
03:43:07.870 --> 03:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
vaccination compliance with some or
 
03:43:10.269 --> 03:43:10.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps all of the dogs in a multi-dog
 
03:43:13.429 --> 03:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
home the very simplest way to keep from
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
having to pay higher rates is to just
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
not vaccinate some or all of your
 
03:43:21.510 --> 03:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
dogs the group license was never
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
intended to make money for the town's
 
03:43:25.550 --> 03:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
general fund but to maximize
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
distribution of the rabies vaccine to
 
03:43:30.110 --> 03:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
keep our citizens and our animals safer
 
03:43:32.750 --> 03:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
from that deadly disease it is not an
 
03:43:35.550 --> 03:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
overall Financial loss if its existence
 
03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479 align:start position:0%
keeps a rabies outbreak from occurring
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
please vote HB 262 itl as contrary to
 
03:43:44.110 --> 03:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
the continuing effort to keep New
 
03:43:45.790 --> 03:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dogs R
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
free and so I just wanted to because I
 
03:43:50.590 --> 03:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
thought that was an important uh you
 
03:43:54.030 --> 03:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
know point to be made
 
03:43:58.189 --> 03:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
um and that's pretty much all I have and
 
03:44:00.510 --> 03:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
if anybody represent
 
03:44:03.189 --> 03:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair I I like
 
03:44:04.750 --> 03:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
the puzzle that they put in the middle
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
of how to uh the fees for the license of
 
03:44:10.149 --> 03:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
more than seven dogs where you take the
 
03:44:12.149 --> 03:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
dog you add up the dogs and you subtract
 
03:44:14.590 --> 03:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
the this and that it just seems way too
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
complicated to me be helpful at all yeah
 
03:44:21.550 --> 03:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
and and again I have no idea what this
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
um amendment was that uh was was
 
03:44:28.830 --> 03:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned so I don't
 
03:44:31.830 --> 03:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
know in L of that representive Bixby
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
your comments are welcome I think there
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
are a couple ways we can go with this
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
and it is the case that right now if you
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
have four dogs three or four dogs you
 
03:44:41.870 --> 03:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
pay more in licensing than if you have
 
03:44:44.309 --> 03:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
five or more dogs uh which I don't think
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
is entirely Fair uh on the other
 
03:44:51.870 --> 03:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
hand it dog licenses across the board
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
are pretty inexpensive I mean you a dog
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
license now costs less than a basic
 
03:45:02.830 --> 03:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
sandwich this is true for a year right
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
your license for a Year's license versus
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
one day sandwich one meal sandwich so um
 
03:45:14.309 --> 03:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
so I I so part of me says it's probably
 
03:45:17.670 --> 03:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
just not worth bothering with uh part of
 
03:45:19.750 --> 03:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
me says well if we wanted to do
 
03:45:22.950 --> 03:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
something maybe we could raise the group
 
03:45:29.950 --> 03:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
dog license to be uh you know even or um
 
03:45:32.030 --> 03:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
even with what you would pay if you had
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
four dogs so you know four dogs or more
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
you have you know there's a flat Fe for
 
03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
whatever um but
 
03:45:42.750 --> 03:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh given how many bills we have this
 
03:45:45.790 --> 03:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
term I think I think maybe not bothering
 
03:45:49.189 --> 03:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
with it is there there there is a fairly
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
standard procedure in many committees
 
03:45:53.309 --> 03:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
where if the sponsor doesn't show up we
 
03:45:54.710 --> 03:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
just it just gets
 
03:45:58.510 --> 03:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
ited um and I was the unfortunate
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
recipient of that action when I was in
 
03:46:02.830 --> 03:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
another hearing and forgot that I needed
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
to cross the hall and introduce the bill
 
03:46:05.439 --> 03:46:08.389 align:start position:0%
to cross the hall and introduce the bill
so

03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
um so yeah so well I'm I'm not not
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
strictly speaking but in this case I
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
think think that
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
um we don't have much to go on in terms
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
of and if if representative board us
 
03:46:24.389 --> 03:46:24.399 align:start position:0%
were to come in before the end of the
 
03:46:26.990 --> 03:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
day and said say I'm so sorry I'm I
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
failed to make the hearing uh here's my
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
testimony on what the what the uh
 
03:46:35.670 --> 03:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
problem or ISS what the problem is and
 
03:46:37.910 --> 03:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
and and how how an amended version of
 
03:46:40.429 --> 03:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
this would fix it then I would say yeah
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
we should do that I that I wasn't given
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
that courtesy but that's okay I i' I'd
 
03:46:47.429 --> 03:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
extend it to someone if they came in the
 
03:46:50.670 --> 03:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
same day and said whoops here's here
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
here's an attempt to fix it I would do
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
the same but uh if we don't hear
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
anything from representative board Us by
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
the end of the day I think it's probably
 
03:47:02.590 --> 03:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
an itl yep okay I'm cool with that um I
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that we would exec it out
 
03:47:07.990 --> 03:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
today but certainly next week and we
 
03:47:09.269 --> 03:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
won't know before the end of the day
 
03:47:09.279 --> 03:47:10.870 align:start position:0%
won't know before the end of the day
sure

03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay um I will then just say that
 
03:47:18.070 --> 03:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
on the online portal we had one person
 
03:47:20.910 --> 03:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
support the bill and three people
 
03:47:23.790 --> 03:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
opposed the bill and I don't know what
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh we had on the blue sheet up there if
 
03:47:28.630 --> 03:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
we want to you want to go grab that
 
03:47:28.640 --> 03:47:41.670 align:start position:0%
we want to you want to go grab that
thank

03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.910 --> 03:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
you it's well I think
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
the letteres kind of explained it in
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
that if you have a if you have a large
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
number of dogs like if you're if you're
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
breeding and you don't sell all the
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
puppies immediately or if you have say
 
03:48:02.149 --> 03:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
if you're a musher and you have a bunch
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
of Huskies or
 
03:48:07.870 --> 03:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
then having a large number of dogs to
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
keep crack of is you
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
know you may be end up changing your
 
03:48:16.510 --> 03:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
tring go out with someone else you might
 
03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
end up um you know people who have have
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
U hunting dogs will sometimes trade dogs
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
with other Hunters um so U maintaining a
 
03:48:32.149 --> 03:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
so it's essentially it's a way of
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to make sure all
 
03:48:37.469 --> 03:48:37.479 align:start position:0%
their dogs are uh have the rabies
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
vaccination and not give them the extra
 
03:48:43.189 --> 03:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
the extra licensing fee burden or
 
03:48:47.349 --> 03:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
and um I don't have any data on how
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
whether it really is more effective in
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
making sure everybody has every dog has
 
03:48:59.349 --> 03:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
a babies vac
 
03:49:01.990 --> 03:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination um I don't know whether
 
03:49:04.469 --> 03:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
there's any sort of you know checking up
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
on that uh but uh I well I I know that
 
03:49:12.030 --> 03:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
when you have when you get your dog
 
03:49:14.910 --> 03:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated that
 
03:49:17.149 --> 03:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
of the vaccination report goes to the
 
03:49:21.189 --> 03:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
city cour or or the town court right so
 
03:49:23.790 --> 03:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
um so that would be you know so if you
 
03:49:25.309 --> 03:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
have group license then you're going to
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
have like more than five five or
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:37.070 --> 03:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
on okay uh I um for the blue sheet I
 
03:49:39.389 --> 03:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
mean I already reported out the on the
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
online portal we had one person's
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
support three people opposed on the blue
 
03:49:45.189 --> 03:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
sheet we had one person
 
03:49:47.349 --> 03:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
support and one person
 
03:49:50.189 --> 03:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
opposed and I'm going to close out the
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
262 and we cannot begin our next hearing
 
03:50:00.349 --> 03:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
until 2 o'clock so we've got a half hour
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
and in that time uh I just wanted to let
 
03:50:08.030 --> 03:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know I had a um report done up by uh
 
03:50:09.189 --> 03:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
03:50:12.429 --> 03:50:12.439 align:start position:0%
researcher uh regarding animal testing
 
03:50:14.830 --> 03:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire so if you
 
03:50:17.030 --> 03:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
can take the time to look through it I'd
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate it before our next hearing
 
03:50:22.229 --> 03:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
just to give you some background
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
familiarity um I asked the
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions are there any facilities in
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that use animals in
 
03:50:31.349 --> 03:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
testing such as businesses universities
 
03:50:34.189 --> 03:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
or animal research centers specifically
 
03:50:36.590 --> 03:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
biomedical research meaning the
 
03:50:38.149 --> 03:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
investigation of the biological
 
03:50:40.149 --> 03:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
processes and causes of disease or
 
03:50:41.590 --> 03:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
research conducted to increase
 
03:50:44.349 --> 03:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
fundamental scientific knowledge and to
 
03:50:46.070 --> 03:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
EXP expand the understanding about how
 
03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
processes in living organisms develop
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
and function if yes what kind of testing
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
do they do and for what purposes if yes
 
03:50:55.550 --> 03:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
do any of them receive New Hampshire
 
03:50:58.670 --> 03:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
State funding if yes what happens to the
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
animals once testing is completed if yes
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
are the animals harmed by the testing
 
03:51:06.110 --> 03:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
employed the bill mentions traditional
 
03:51:08.830 --> 03:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
animal test method which means a process
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
or procedure using animals to obtain
 
03:51:13.189 --> 03:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
information on the characteristics of a
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
chemical or agent and that generates
 
03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
information regarding the ability of a
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
chemical or agent to produce a specific
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
biological effect under specified
 
03:51:23.950 --> 03:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
conditions do any of the testing methods
 
03:51:26.790 --> 03:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
used employ these tests or other tests
 
03:51:29.790 --> 03:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
and finally what other states pass
 
03:51:31.469 --> 03:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
similar Le
 
03:51:36.189 --> 03:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
legislation so um Christie tackled this
 
03:51:38.070 --> 03:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh made a bunch of phone calls to a
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
bunch of different places and uh the
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
result is uh some information that she
 
03:51:44.870 --> 03:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
gathered for us so please take the time
 
03:51:47.870 --> 03:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
to look through it and uh we'll we'll be
 
03:51:56.750 --> 03:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.760 --> 03:52:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
suppose

03:52:07.189 --> 03:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
no all right M yes does it matter at
 
03:52:15.429 --> 03:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
this point if there's a um amend
 
03:52:18.149 --> 03:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
22 I mean I I can go upstairs and ask
 
03:52:22.510 --> 03:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative service 262 was it 252 2
 
03:52:27.030 --> 03:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 262 um you s you could if you
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
like sure thank you
 
03:52:32.510 --> 03:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
hello of which
 
03:52:40.710 --> 03:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:43.149 --> 03:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
see I think I only made enough for the
 
03:52:45.630 --> 03:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
03:52:51.070 --> 03:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah um I'll see if I can get a
 
03:52:51.080 --> 03:52:53.850 align:start position:0%
so yeah um I'll see if I can get a
copy

03:52:53.850 --> 03:52:53.860 align:start position:0%
copy
 
03:52:53.860 --> 03:52:58.630 align:start position:0%

her Bill thank you for coming this
 
04:21:19.990 --> 04:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon and Welcome to our committee

04:21:34.030 --> 04:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill um hb401 relative to animal testing
 
04:21:36.990 --> 04:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
funded by New Hampshire taxpayers um the
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to prohibit the use of New
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State funds for animal testing
 
04:21:42.830 --> 04:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is a necessary step toward
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
aligning our state policies with the
 
04:21:47.149 --> 04:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
values of granite Staters and advancing

modern Humane and effective scientific
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
practices animal testing is not only
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
cruel but also relatively ineffective
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
according to FDA data 95% of drugs that
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
pass animal tests fail in human trials
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
due to differences in
 
04:22:04.550 --> 04:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
physiology um rendering these
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
experiments an unreliable predictor of

04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
Administration made significant strides
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
in addressing this issue during
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
President Trump's first term Federal
 
04:22:35.670 --> 04:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
funding was cut for several cruel animal
 
04:22:37.830 --> 04:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
experiments including nicotine addiction
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
studies on monkeys and toxoplasmosis
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
research on cats his Administration also
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
influenced the epa's decision to phase
 
04:22:50.229 --> 04:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
out mamalian testing by 2035 and
 
04:22:53.710 --> 04:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
mandated NIH um to explore alternatives
 
04:22:56.710 --> 04:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
to Primate Research these actions have
 
04:22:58.990 --> 04:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
saved countless animals while
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
encouraging the adoption of modern

subsequent administrations progress has
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
stalled making it imperative for States
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire to lead where Federal
 
04:23:12.670 --> 04:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
efforts have faltered the recent hearing
 
04:23:15.149 --> 04:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
before the US House oversight committee
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
on February 6th highlighted the urgency
 
04:23:20.149 --> 04:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
of this issue testimonies revealed
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funded experiments involving
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
horrific abuses such as the infamous now
 
04:23:27.750 --> 04:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
Infamous beagle experiments exposed by
 
04:23:29.950 --> 04:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
the white coat waste project these
 
04:23:32.189 --> 04:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
included injecting puppies with toxic
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
drugs severing their vocal cords to
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
silence their cries and allowing
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
sandflies to eat them alive such
 
04:23:42.590 --> 04:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
practices are not only barbaric but also
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
gross misuse of taxpayer dollars this is
 
04:23:48.109 --> 04:23:48.119 align:start position:0%
not a partisan issue it's a moral one
 
04:23:50.189 --> 04:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
polls consistently show that most
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
Americans Republicans Democrats and
 
04:23:55.389 --> 04:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
independents alike oppose animal testing
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire our citizens share
 
04:23:58.950 --> 04:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
this sentiment we pride ourselves on
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility and ethical
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
governance funding cruel and ineffective
 
04:24:07.149 --> 04:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
experiments contracts contracts these
 
04:24:10.590 --> 04:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
values when Superior Alternatives exist
 
04:24:12.429 --> 04:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
prominent Republicans have spoken out
 
04:24:15.269 --> 04:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
against these practices for example
 
04:24:17.229 --> 04:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
former Congressman Matt Gates stated
 
04:24:19.030 --> 04:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
that ending wasteful government spending
 
04:24:21.630 --> 04:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
on cruel animal experence experiments is
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
both fiscally
 
04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
irresponsible or fiscally responsible to
 
04:24:27.990 --> 04:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
end them and it's also a moral
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
imperative Senator ran Paul has
 
04:24:32.349 --> 04:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
championed legislation to modernize drug
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
testing protocols by eliminating
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
outdated animal mandates by passing
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
hb401 New Hampshire can take a stand
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
against cruelty and inefficiency while
 
04:24:45.910 --> 04:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
fing innovation in science let us invest
 
04:24:47.950 --> 04:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
in technologies that save lives both
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
human and animal and uphold our states
 
04:24:53.109 --> 04:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
commitment to ethical leadership thank
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
you for your time thank you do you have
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
a copy of your testimony to did you hand
 
04:24:58.750 --> 04:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
that out I
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
can okay thank you mine's all scribbled
 
04:25:03.550 --> 04:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
up representative
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:25:08.710 --> 04:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
your bill and taking questions um I
 
04:25:11.550 --> 04:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
think the reason that is given I've
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
talked to people that have been in this
 
04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
kind of field before and the reason I've
 
04:25:17.229 --> 04:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
been told that why we even test on
 
04:25:20.109 --> 04:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
animals is because to do those types of
 
04:25:22.189 --> 04:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
tests on humans would be
 
04:25:24.429 --> 04:25:24.439 align:start position:0%
unethical uh and I think to myself well
 
04:25:25.950 --> 04:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
if it's not ethical to do it on a human
 
04:25:28.710 --> 04:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
why are we doing it on an animal um but
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
then the it kind of begs the question
 
04:25:35.389 --> 04:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
well if we don't do it at all do we risk
 
04:25:38.790 --> 04:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
not gaining new understanding of nature
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
to the point where we can help cure
 
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
people of you know disease and things
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
like that um my solution personally
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
would be that no you do test on humans
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
that are willing and capable of agreeing
 
04:25:52.750 --> 04:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
to and then you probably pay them a lot
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
of money and I think ultimately what it
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
all comes down to is money is that these
 
04:26:00.030 --> 04:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
corporations can do these tests on the
 
04:26:01.950 --> 04:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
cheap whereas if they had to do it on
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
people they'd have to have their
 
04:26:05.309 --> 04:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
theories down a lot better they'd have
 
04:26:07.030 --> 04:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
to be much more careful about the test
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
they do and then they have to pay a lot
 
04:26:10.389 --> 04:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
of money so I think that's what it all
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
comes down to is money um do you see
 
04:26:15.830 --> 04:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
that if we were to get rid of animal
 
04:26:18.750 --> 04:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
testing that there would be a mechanism
 
04:26:21.710 --> 04:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
to still do the types of research that
 
04:26:23.950 --> 04:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
they do in order to find the cures that
 
04:26:27.149 --> 04:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to find um I I
 
04:26:30.109 --> 04:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
actually like your suggestion but um
 
04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
there are so many modern methodologies I
 
04:26:35.469 --> 04:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
gave out a handout earlier that explains
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
some of them they're actually more
 
04:26:40.950 --> 04:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
effective and more reliable and cheaper
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
and faster and and just better so that
 
04:26:46.750 --> 04:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
no living beings need to be um abused in
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
any way so those methods would be I
 
04:26:52.670 --> 04:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
think the best
 
04:26:55.229 --> 04:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
alternative um so I I have a couple of
 
04:26:59.109 --> 04:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
questions um number one I appreci really
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sentiment of this bill
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
because I don't think that animals
 
04:27:05.710 --> 04:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
should be tortured in in uh you know
 
04:27:09.630 --> 04:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
like what you had said as an example uh
 
04:27:11.710 --> 04:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
you know with sand fleas uh eating them
 
04:27:13.469 --> 04:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
alive while their you know vocal cords
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
are cut or whatever that that's truly
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
truly barbaric um but I I'm wondering
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
though do you know of any facilities in
 
04:27:27.149 --> 04:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are receiving State
 
04:27:29.910 --> 04:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
funding that are doing that kind of
 
04:27:32.349 --> 04:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
testing it's actually really hard to
 
04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
track them all and that's one of the
 
04:27:36.070 --> 04:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
things the bill says I forgot to mention
 
04:27:38.590 --> 04:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
um I sent out an email late this morning
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
um mentioning a couple of minor
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
housekeeping issues one of which is that
 
04:27:44.590 --> 04:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
the term under definitions in the bill
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
the term biome biomedical testing was
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
left in and that was left in from a
 
04:27:51.510 --> 04:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
previous Bill last year Senate bill so
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
that was removed um because this bill
 
04:27:56.790 --> 04:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
only applies to product testing um and
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds and then the other thing
 
04:28:03.109 --> 04:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
is that the final um uh section there on
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
um reporting left out the word annual so
 
04:28:08.910 --> 04:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
that um that final section covers um
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
your question um it would be um
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
should the bill pass it would be um
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
required that the um uh speaker and the
 
04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
Senate President receive a report
 
04:28:24.189 --> 04:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
annually telling about where animals
 
04:28:27.550 --> 04:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
have been tested on when by whom how
 
04:28:30.830 --> 04:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
much all of those details so um it's
 
04:28:32.590 --> 04:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
just really hard to track right now and
 
04:28:33.750 --> 04:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that I would
 
04:28:36.149 --> 04:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
like to see addressed and this is this
 
04:28:39.349 --> 04:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
bill only addresses ingredient or
 
04:28:41.469 --> 04:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
product testing in the state with
 
04:28:41.479 --> 04:28:43.590 align:start position:0%
product testing in the state with
taxpayer

04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
right now we had trouble finding
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
instances of that being the case but as
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
I said for one thing it's very hard to
 
04:28:50.590 --> 04:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
track and for another thing I would like
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
it on record that that may not happen in
 
04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
the future so so yeah so I'm just kind
 
04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
of wondering again if this is you know a
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
bill where uh you know it's it's a it's
 
04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem where I
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
mean if I I don't I I still haven't
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
heard of any places in New Hampshire who
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
are doing ingredient or product testing
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
using animals oh it's happening a lot
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's just not happening with taxpayer
 
04:29:18.870 --> 04:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
funds it's um you know you know where
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's happening without taxpayer
 
04:29:24.109 --> 04:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
funds I don't I mean I don't have the
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
details in front of me but it's it's um
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
it happens all over with corporations
 
04:29:31.630 --> 04:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
like you know like I don't know L'Oreal
 
04:29:35.070 --> 04:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
or something like that um that um test
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
their products on animals and we're just
 
04:29:39.790 --> 04:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that they don't do
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
it with taxpayer funds we're not trying
 
04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
to I I would love to ban all animal
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
testing but this bill does not do that
 
04:29:47.550 --> 04:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's not Banning animal testing it's
 
04:29:49.990 --> 04:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
just Banning animal testing with
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds and I think we have to
 
04:29:54.109 --> 04:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
make a distinction though between you
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
know what cosmetic what kinds of testing
 
04:29:59.149 --> 04:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
biomedical testing we're doing because
 
04:30:01.750 --> 04:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
certainly you know we have the uh New
 
04:30:05.229 --> 04:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterinary Diagnostic Clinic
 
04:30:08.189 --> 04:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh that laboratory that is uh doing
 
04:30:11.109 --> 04:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
constant um uh testing on different
 
04:30:14.189 --> 04:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
tissue samples and uh you know trying to
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
determine disease and all that kind of
 
04:30:19.389 --> 04:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
thing so um you know I I certainly don't
 
04:30:22.670 --> 04:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
want if if we do anything with this bill
 
04:30:25.990 --> 04:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
I certainly don't want to uh to impede
 
04:30:29.070 --> 04:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
or ban any of that kind of work that's
 
04:30:30.510 --> 04:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's really important work that they
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
do that's why we had that biomedical
 
04:30:35.469 --> 04:30:35.479 align:start position:0%
research portion taken out it wasn't
 
04:30:37.389 --> 04:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
intended to be in there and it was just
 
04:30:39.109 --> 04:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
accidentally put in there so thank you
 
04:30:40.750 --> 04:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you had a question
 
04:30:42.429 --> 04:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
so to clarify you know what this would
 
04:30:48.790 --> 04:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
cover and wouldn't cover uh would it
 
04:30:50.830 --> 04:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
would it cover any of the basic research
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's happening at UNH or at Dartmouth
 
04:30:56.269 --> 04:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock or at Dartmouth or other um
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
university not not regarding biomedical
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
research just product testing okay so
 
04:31:04.750 --> 04:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
product and ingredient testing okay and
 
04:31:07.469 --> 04:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
uh so are
 
04:31:07.479 --> 04:31:09.070 align:start position:0%
uh so are
there

04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
so uh followup sure followup yeah so if
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
a um if a company that was uh doing
 
04:31:23.309 --> 04:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
product testing on animals got a
 
04:31:28.510 --> 04:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
um got a a tax uh invest a uh Business
 
04:31:31.149 --> 04:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
Development tax break from the state
 
04:31:32.990 --> 04:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
would that be something that would be
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
covered by this bill actually that's a
 
04:31:37.070 --> 04:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
very good question and I'm not sure of
 
04:31:42.510 --> 04:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
the answer to that okay and uh and uh
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
you so you probably don't have a sense
 
04:31:47.070 --> 04:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
of what the Bia would think about that I
 
04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
don't I would assume it would be covered
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
under this bill but um people speaking
 
04:31:54.309 --> 04:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
after me may be able to address that
 
04:31:56.349 --> 04:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
 
04:31:56.359 --> 04:31:58.790 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
representative

04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:32:01.450 --> 04:32:01.460 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair
 
04:32:01.460 --> 04:32:03.109 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair
[Music]

04:32:03.109 --> 04:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:32:07.349 --> 04:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
um you might not know this or not um I
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
would assume that most of the if there
 
04:32:13.469 --> 04:32:13.479 align:start position:0%
is any I I would say not necessarily
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
animal um testing that's done but
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
research and all that kind of stuff
 
04:32:20.830 --> 04:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
that's done in Durham and in Handover um
 
04:32:23.710 --> 04:32:23.720 align:start position:0%
those would be all um pretty much being
 
04:32:27.389 --> 04:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
paid for by federal grants I assume yeah
 
04:32:29.070 --> 04:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
as far as I know but those aren't what's
 
04:32:30.510 --> 04:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
addressed here because those are
 
04:32:33.070 --> 04:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
biomedical not product exactly they
 
04:32:35.349 --> 04:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
don't yeah I
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
mean Madam chair all of the work that we
 
04:32:40.349 --> 04:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
know that um when we started as a
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
committee and went to um to the state to
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
the lab there and stuff is those are all
 
04:32:48.550 --> 04:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
grants most those things were Federal I
 
04:32:52.510 --> 04:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
don't even think there was any state
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
involvement at all correct no but the
 
04:32:57.790 --> 04:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
state does fund the lab with a portion
 
04:33:01.229 --> 04:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
of uh I guess the dog licenses or
 
04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
whatever they there is a portion of
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
funding that comes from the state to
 
04:33:08.269 --> 04:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
keep the the lab running am I correct
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby that's correct okay
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe those are for
 
04:33:15.390 --> 04:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
products yeah yeah there's not a product
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
related most of the testing that they're
 
04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
doing is also if you know there's you
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
know sick bird sick something that you
 
04:33:25.109 --> 04:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
know so they're looking to say okay what
 
04:33:26.910 --> 04:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
what could be in New Hampshire right now
 
04:33:28.150 --> 04:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
something like that they do
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
investigative work um none of this has
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
anything to do with testing currently
 
04:33:35.789 --> 04:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
there are 12 other states who have
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
banned animal tested products from being
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
sold in their states
 
04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
but um that's something we'd have to
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
address with another Billard thank you
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative Howard and then
 
04:33:51.150 --> 04:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
representative BX thank you madam chair
 
04:33:53.949 --> 04:33:53.959 align:start position:0%
so um given that there isn't really any
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
product testing especially with State
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
funds now do you anticipate an influx is
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
that the reason that you're writing this
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
bill or it's more that it's hard to
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
track it's hard to tell what's happening
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
where and because it's hard to track I
 
04:34:09.670 --> 04:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
would just like to make sure it doesn't
 
04:34:12.789 --> 04:34:12.799 align:start position:0%
happen or either now or in in the future
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers shouldn't be funding this
 
04:34:16.310 --> 04:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
anyway it's it's something that
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
Corporation should do sure um so do do
 
04:34:22.189 --> 04:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
we I sorry for my ignorance but do we
 
04:34:24.590 --> 04:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
have any such industry that we would
 
04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
should be watching at this point I I
 
04:34:31.230 --> 04:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
think all um products you know whether
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
it's Cosmetics or um anything you know
 
04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
so often cleaning supplies are dropped
 
04:34:39.551 --> 04:34:39.561 align:start position:0%
into rabbit eyes or whatever anything
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
like that um right but and but they're
 
04:34:44.590 --> 04:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
uced in New Hampshire I'm not we just
 
04:34:46.349 --> 04:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
don't know just don't know it's really
 
04:34:48.189 --> 04:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
hard we've done a lot of research we
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
worked with um Physicians committee for
 
04:34:51.590 --> 04:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
responsible medicine we worked with
 
04:34:53.629 --> 04:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
white coat waste oh by the way um Dr
 
04:34:56.189 --> 04:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
Barnard the head of um Physicians
 
04:34:57.910 --> 04:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
committee for responsible medicine did
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
send out an email um which I haven't
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
seen yet it just I think it just
 
04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
occurred um but um we worked with
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
several groups trying to find um answers
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
to those and it things just aren't um
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and then
 
04:35:19.830 --> 04:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative King so I believe the I'm
 
04:35:21.910 --> 04:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure of the funding stream
 
04:35:24.150 --> 04:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
but I believe that some of the funding
 
04:35:27.709 --> 04:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
for the um New New Hampshire
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
agricultural research station does come
 
04:35:33.551 --> 04:35:33.561 align:start position:0%
from uh either indirectly or directly
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
from State sources uh is agricultural
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
research something that you would that
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
this bill would cover I don't think so
 
04:35:46.709 --> 04:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
it it's geared towards specific product
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
testing like Cosmetics or cleaning
 
04:35:50.230 --> 04:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
supplies or something I don't know
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
exactly what the follow followup group
 
04:35:58.109 --> 04:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
does so um do you know of any state
 
04:36:01.590 --> 04:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
where there is State funds going towards
 
04:36:03.551 --> 04:36:03.561 align:start position:0%
uh product testing for the private
 
04:36:07.390 --> 04:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
sector I don't I should I don't thank
 
04:36:10.269 --> 04:36:10.279 align:start position:0%
you sorry representative King thank you
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'd like to bring to the uh
 
04:36:15.150 --> 04:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
committee the attention of the committee
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
um an interesting part we haven't yet
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
discussed at least in the questions I
 
04:36:20.910 --> 04:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't think is the last part of it which
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
is the recordkeeping requirements um
 
04:36:25.590 --> 04:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
that seems almost like more important
 
04:36:28.349 --> 04:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
than the rest of it because you know
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
whether I if I understand it correctly
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
let me know if I do understand it
 
04:36:34.189 --> 04:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
correctly that regardless of whether or
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
not they get any state mone's where
 
04:36:37.990 --> 04:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they're
 
04:36:41.070 --> 04:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
doing product testing if they're doing
 
04:36:43.390 --> 04:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
any animal testing whatsoever they need
 
04:36:46.670 --> 04:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
to report that to the house of to the
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and the president
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the Senate so that that way because
 
04:36:51.789 --> 04:36:51.799 align:start position:0%
we've already had a few questions here
 
04:36:53.551 --> 04:36:53.561 align:start position:0%
what kind of testing is done we don't
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
know it would be really nice for us to
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
know what kind of animal testing is
 
04:37:00.150 --> 04:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
being done in this state uh because it's
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
hard to if there is a problem it's hard
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
to fight that problem if you don't
 
04:37:06.670 --> 04:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledge or know where it is so to me
 
04:37:08.590 --> 04:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
that almost seems like the best part of
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
the the bill right so do I have that
 
04:37:12.990 --> 04:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
correct mhm okay okay thank
 
04:37:16.429 --> 04:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
you represent Bixby um is there a
 
04:37:18.670 --> 04:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
definition of a testing
 
04:37:21.470 --> 04:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
facility I don't know if it was put in
 
04:37:23.470 --> 04:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
here I don't think so because that would
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
make it difficult to do the reporting
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
right um I
 
04:37:30.789 --> 04:37:30.799 align:start position:0%
don't before I got old I could see
 
04:37:30.799 --> 04:37:31.830 align:start position:0%
don't before I got old I could see
without

04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:37:33.949 --> 04:37:33.959 align:start position:0%
glasses um yeah I don't think that's one
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
defined so yeah no testing facility so
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
others who come behind me may have um
 
04:37:46.199 --> 04:37:48.629 align:start position:0%
others who come behind me may have um
further

04:37:48.629 --> 04:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:52.390 --> 04:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
details okay Representatives uh grber uh
 
04:37:54.510 --> 04:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam chair and thank you
 
04:37:57.510 --> 04:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm trying to
 
04:37:59.949 --> 04:37:59.959 align:start position:0%
catch up and understand it the the I
 
04:38:02.349 --> 04:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
have a question on the the last uh
 
04:38:04.750 --> 04:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph 359
 
04:38:08.429 --> 04:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
V3 uh it says um beginning January 1st
 
04:38:10.150 --> 04:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
every testing facility in the state
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
shall make a report available to the
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and representatives
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate which includes
 
04:38:18.990 --> 04:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
the number of species of animals used
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
types of numbers of tests used and the
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
purpose of the testing for all methods
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say uh of groups who use
 
04:38:29.349 --> 04:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
State funds here does is this uh is your
 
04:38:31.150 --> 04:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
intention to have this for any testing
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
facility or just those who receive state
 
04:38:36.390 --> 04:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
funds my intention is for it as
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
representative King mentioned so that we
 
04:38:40.590 --> 04:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
can find out what really is happening
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
where so this will be any any uh group
 
04:38:46.990 --> 04:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh UNH or private or whatever it is or
 
04:38:50.349 --> 04:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
federal M too that correct I just it
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
wasn't clarire makes certain thank you I
 
04:38:54.990 --> 04:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
could I could certainly get that amended
 
04:38:57.310 --> 04:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
um I I also not don't know if you
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
noticed the word annual is missing there
 
04:39:01.869 --> 04:39:01.879 align:start position:0%
so I had that added into the amendment
 
04:39:02.789 --> 04:39:02.799 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions from the
 
04:39:08.189 --> 04:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
committee representative H Haskins thank
 
04:39:11.789 --> 04:39:11.799 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just a a slight addition
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
for every testing facility that could be
 
04:39:17.470 --> 04:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
student outcomes for you know SATs
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
testing could mean anything so to insert
 
04:39:23.189 --> 04:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
animal back into that just for
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
clarifying purposes that would thank you
 
04:39:28.269 --> 04:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
04:39:28.279 --> 04:39:29.910 align:start position:0%
that could be
done

04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me representative
 
04:39:34.910 --> 04:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you Madame chair and um
 
04:39:37.150 --> 04:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming before us now
 
04:39:39.788 --> 04:39:39.798 align:start position:0%
regarding the issue of the recordkeeping
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering why you decided to
 
04:39:44.350 --> 04:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
make the two entities to receive that
 
04:39:45.868 --> 04:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
information of the speaker of the house
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the president of the Senate I
 
04:39:49.230 --> 04:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't normally think of them as being
 
04:39:50.590 --> 04:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
the folks that would keep that kind of
 
04:39:52.470 --> 04:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
record keeping as opposed to one of our
 
04:39:56.110 --> 04:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
health departments I I I suspect that
 
04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
that came originally from last year's
 
04:40:00.080 --> 04:40:00.090 align:start position:0%
Senate bill but
 
04:40:00.090 --> 04:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
Senate bill but
[Music]

04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:04.830 --> 04:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
um I didn't request it it came from OS
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
that way which I think is because it was
 
04:40:09.470 --> 04:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the Senate Bill last year all right
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
so if if there was an an agency or
 
04:40:14.310 --> 04:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
Department we thought might be the best
 
04:40:16.110 --> 04:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
department to to keep these types of
 
04:40:19.070 --> 04:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
records and track them you would not be
 
04:40:21.310 --> 04:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh we wouldn't object to us making that
 
04:40:24.150 --> 04:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
change I would like to I would like to
 
04:40:27.550 --> 04:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
see who what the agency would be because
 
04:40:30.030 --> 04:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
um I would at least if it went to an
 
04:40:31.628 --> 04:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
agency I would like
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
oversight and um the speaker and the
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
Senate President
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
may be um able to do o oversight rather
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
than Le being an agency with no
 
04:40:45.628 --> 04:40:45.638 align:start position:0%
oversight all right thank
 
04:40:47.550 --> 04:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions
 
04:40:49.708 --> 04:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
representative King yeah the question is
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
for you madam chair or somebody else who
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
might know um I think that was a really
 
04:40:55.390 --> 04:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
good question uh representative Scully
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
just asked um I do remember vaguely
 
04:41:00.708 --> 04:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
something like that happening with um
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
regarding uh uh transgender procedures
 
04:41:06.270 --> 04:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
in uh New Hampshire hospitals that they
 
04:41:07.948 --> 04:41:07.958 align:start position:0%
had to report that to the speaker of the
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
house so I don't think it's totally
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
unwarranted for that sort of a thing to
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
happen but I'm just curious if you know
 
04:41:16.350 --> 04:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
of any other examples or or or in your
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
experience why that information OSS
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
might have had that sent to the speaker
 
04:41:23.350 --> 04:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
of the house and the president of the
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
Senate I don't know they get a lot of
 
04:41:27.948 --> 04:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
reports of all kinds of different things
 
04:41:31.390 --> 04:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah um I I I think that the standard
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
reporting for uh studies that are
 
04:41:37.750 --> 04:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
requested by the legislature is the
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
speaker and the president of the Senate
 
04:41:42.910 --> 04:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
and some sometimes times other other
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
entities are listed as well but those
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
are the the standard ones for just about
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
any report sometimes they're sent to the
 
04:41:52.708 --> 04:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
State Library too um and sometimes
 
04:41:55.150 --> 04:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
they're sent to the governor's office it
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
depends I don't know so I mean we if you
 
04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
know we plan to do any work on this bill
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly we can take a look
 
04:42:05.070 --> 04:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
and see who who would
 
04:42:05.080 --> 04:42:06.868 align:start position:0%
and see who who would
be

04:42:06.868 --> 04:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
um uh interested parties or or uh re
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we believe should get that
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
information so yeah um represent Penza
 
04:42:20.470 --> 04:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um thank you madam chair Just In
 
04:42:23.350 --> 04:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
following up with that I I there's so
 
04:42:25.990 --> 04:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
many committees studies things that
 
04:42:28.990 --> 04:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
happen that um the members of the public
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
would um really love to have that
 
04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
information and it's it's not like a
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
place that um is found so like after a
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
study committee and that's you know if
 
04:42:40.190 --> 04:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's buried into the general court
 
04:42:42.590 --> 04:42:42.600 align:start position:0%
website and given to the president of
 
04:42:44.830 --> 04:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the and then the speaker
 
04:42:46.750 --> 04:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
of the house it would be really great if
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
there was one repository for this type
 
04:42:51.708 --> 04:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
of information if it's not directly
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
assigned with an agency that makes sense
 
04:42:57.070 --> 04:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
um with what representative Scully said
 
04:43:00.990 --> 04:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
um you know there's from DHHS to uh to
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
Dees all of those websites they have
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
lots of um robust amount of information
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
but gosh it would really be nice with
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
all of the work that the legislature
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
does with both sides of um of the aisle
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
here um to have a repository for that
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
kind of information it's a lot of work
 
04:43:21.510 --> 04:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
that gets done many many hours and then
 
04:43:25.150 --> 04:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:27.750 --> 04:43:27.760 align:start position:0%

04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%

testing I'm here today to support House

Bill

04:44:49.070 --> 04:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
401 animal testing has been happening
 
04:44:54.788 --> 04:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
since as far back as 500 BC that's more
 
04:44:54.798 --> 04:44:55.830 align:start position:0%
since as far back as 500 BC that's more
than

04:44:55.830 --> 04:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
2,520 years ago and every year over 100
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
million animals are burned crippled
 
04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
poisoned and abused in US labs they are
 
04:45:08.948 --> 04:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
injected with toxins and diseases that
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
cause damage to their bodies and Minds
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
most of these experiments are painful
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
cause suffering and even death to the
 
04:45:20.520 --> 04:45:22.430 align:start position:0%
cause suffering and even death to the
animals

04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
animals
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
they they live in tiny empty cages all
 
04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
alone lab life is horrible and
 
04:45:35.868 --> 04:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
cruel 99% of animals used in labs are
 
04:45:38.948 --> 04:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
exempt from the Animal Welfare act
 
04:45:42.030 --> 04:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
protection laws what's worse is that
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
many of the animals are just killed
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
experiments and did you know that nine
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
out of 10 drug medicines that appear
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
safe and effective in animal studies
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
fail when given to humans this is
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
because these animals do not naturally
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
have the same diseases as we do I
 
04:46:05.310 --> 04:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
believe all animals should be loved and
 
04:46:08.788 --> 04:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
cared for and I want to help make a
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
positive difference in the lives of as
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
many animals as I can can House Bill 401
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
will help lead us in this
 
04:46:21.310 --> 04:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
direction we are wasting time money and
 
04:46:24.430 --> 04:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
lives in fact we are delaying Real
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
Results there are better Alternatives
 
04:46:30.430 --> 04:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
that will produce better results for
 
04:46:33.750 --> 04:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
humans and animals animal testing is
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
outdated and with today's technology
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's time to fast forward from 500 BC to
 
04:46:44.430 --> 04:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
20 25 and end animal testing thank you
 
04:46:47.230 --> 04:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
for your time and I ask you to vote OTP
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%

Kurt aronberg and I'm the state director
 
04:48:03.390 --> 04:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
of the Humane Society of the United
 
04:48:06.548 --> 04:48:06.558 align:start position:0%
States now known as Humane world for
 
04:48:06.558 --> 04:48:08.430 align:start position:0%
States now known as Humane world for
animals

04:48:08.430 --> 04:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
animals
 
04:48:12.150 --> 04:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
um and first thing wanted to do was just
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
address the fact that it's impossible to
 
04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
know how much animal testing is
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
happening in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
due to many factors one is the
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
limitation of federal law the Animal
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
Welfare act the federal law that
 
04:48:30.430 --> 04:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
requires research F facilities to
 
04:48:32.750 --> 04:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
annually report their use of some
 
04:48:32.760 --> 04:48:34.270 align:start position:0%
annually report their use of some
warm-blooded

04:48:34.270 --> 04:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
warm-blooded
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
animals specifically exclude the species
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
most commonly used in animal
 
04:48:44.708 --> 04:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
testing how about that including mice
 
04:48:47.430 --> 04:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
rats and fish estimates are that these
 
04:48:50.350 --> 04:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
species represent as many as
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
95% of the animals used in
 
04:48:56.310 --> 04:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
research for those species that are
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
recorded there is no requirement that
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
the facility report the purpose of their
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
use so it is unclear how many are used
 
04:49:05.788 --> 04:49:05.798 align:start position:0%
in product
 
04:49:08.788 --> 04:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
testing in another limitation to our
 
04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
ability to fully assess current animal
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
an testing happening in New Hampshire
 
04:49:15.470 --> 04:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
companies must only report animal use
 
04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
under their headquarters location this
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
means that if a company has an animal
 
04:49:22.628 --> 04:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
testing facility in New Hampshire but is
 
04:49:25.030 --> 04:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
headquartered in another state those
 
04:49:27.868 --> 04:49:27.878 align:start position:0%
animals reported would appear to be used
 
04:49:29.110 --> 04:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
in another
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
state so that would be false
 
04:49:36.990 --> 04:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
information in 2023 just two years ago
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
three research facilities headquartered
 
04:49:42.030 --> 04:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire reported using animals
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
covered by the
 
04:49:46.948 --> 04:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
AWA the University of New Hampshire
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College and the hidden Brook
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
Farm however given the limitations in
 
04:49:55.628 --> 04:49:55.638 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements it is impossible
 
04:49:58.270 --> 04:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
to know how many animals are actually
 
04:50:00.910 --> 04:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
being used in the state and how many
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
facilities are doing the
 
04:50:06.750 --> 04:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
testing and as has been talked about
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
hb401 does contain an important
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
reporting provision that would provide
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
clarity about the number of animals
 
04:50:17.310 --> 04:50:17.320 align:start position:0%
being used in New Hampshire facilities
 
04:50:20.430 --> 04:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
receiving public funds so I hope that is
 
04:50:24.230 --> 04:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
helpful to the committee in trying to
 
04:50:28.230 --> 04:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
untangle this web um so what this bill
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
does do is when conducting conducting
 
04:50:34.350 --> 04:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
any ingredient or product testing in the
 
04:50:37.190 --> 04:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
state no testing facility receiving
 
04:50:39.470 --> 04:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
funding from the state of New Hampshire
 
04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
shall use a a traditional animal test
 
04:50:46.990 --> 04:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
method unless such method is of direct
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
benefit of
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
animals so that is in here
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
that uh Roman 3 direct benefit of
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
animals means research or testing that
 
04:50:59.548 --> 04:50:59.558 align:start position:0%
is specifically designed to improve the
 
04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
health well-being or medical treatment
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the species being used in the te in
 
04:51:07.270 --> 04:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
testing so I think that would cover many
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
of the uh questions about the the labs
 
04:51:13.390 --> 04:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
in the state that are used for
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosing animal diseases and things
 
04:51:22.150 --> 04:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:22.160 --> 04:51:25.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:51:25.390 --> 04:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
um so traditional animal test method is
 
04:51:31.470 --> 04:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
defined as a process or procedure using
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
animals to obtain information on the
 
04:51:37.548 --> 04:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
characteristics of a chemical or agent
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
that generates information regarding the
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
ability of a chemical or agent to
 
04:51:46.510 --> 04:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
produce a specific biological effect
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
under specific
 
04:51:51.708 --> 04:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
conditions direct benefit to the animals
 
04:51:53.948 --> 04:51:53.958 align:start position:0%
is defined as research in testing that
 
04:51:55.948 --> 04:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
is specifically designed to improve the
 
04:51:57.990 --> 04:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
health well-being or medical treatment
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
of the species being used in
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
testing so if a testing facility
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
violates this provision it shall
 
04:52:06.750 --> 04:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
immediately lose its funding from the
 
04:52:09.430 --> 04:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and it also
 
04:52:12.708 --> 04:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
contains a reporting provision as we
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um now while we support this
 
04:52:19.948 --> 04:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
bill um we would like to see a much more
 
04:52:23.390 --> 04:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh approach to this in the
 
04:52:23.400 --> 04:52:25.030 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh approach to this in the
state

04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that there's
 
04:52:33.030 --> 04:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to do that but uh I
 
04:52:34.990 --> 04:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
think this is a good
 
04:52:35.000 --> 04:52:37.350 align:start position:0%
think this is a good
start

04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
start
 
04:52:39.628 --> 04:52:39.638 align:start position:0%
um I know there are other people waiting
 
04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
04:52:43.470 --> 04:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day here so I I'll I'll
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
stop here and take any questions
 
04:52:46.400 --> 04:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
stop here and take any questions
representative

04:52:47.990 --> 04:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:52.150 --> 04:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
Bixby so would uh research done at UNH
 
04:52:56.270 --> 04:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
on dairy cattle for the purpose of uh
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
determining feeds uh uh uh feeding mixes
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
that would uh improve the production the
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
milk production of the cattle would that
 
04:53:06.080 --> 04:53:06.868 align:start position:0%
milk production of the cattle would that
be

04:53:06.868 --> 04:53:06.878 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
considered uh would that be under uh
 
04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
something that would be banned by this
 
04:53:15.070 --> 04:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
bill or would that would that be
 
04:53:17.070 --> 04:53:17.080 align:start position:0%
acceptable well it would seem to me it
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
benefits that animal than it benefits
 
04:53:20.910 --> 04:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
that animal but the idea is that the
 
04:53:27.390 --> 04:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:30.830 --> 04:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
production I if it was I don't know the
 
04:53:33.750 --> 04:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
answer to that but that that's
 
04:53:36.030 --> 04:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
why you're the people who have to
 
04:53:38.310 --> 04:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
clarify this
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
but that's your job
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
fortunately uh yeah
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
so represent Penza thank you madam chair
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
um quick question you might not know
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
this or not that could be um maybe I
 
04:53:55.548 --> 04:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
could ask a question of someone else in
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
the audience if they know um
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
obviously we're going to say that we
 
04:54:04.868 --> 04:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
have no idea of of people that are
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily doing this right now so
 
04:54:09.708 --> 04:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
let's say it's it's you said it's mainly
 
04:54:14.030 --> 04:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
common mice rats and what was the third
 
04:54:19.708 --> 04:54:19.718 align:start position:0%
fish 95% is the okay so um if someone is
 
04:54:23.510 --> 04:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
doing that right now in their facility
 
04:54:25.750 --> 04:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
um you know whatever let's say they're
 
04:54:28.070 --> 04:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing type facility of some sort
 
04:54:30.590 --> 04:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
of product or whatever um in New
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's no doubt they have to
 
04:54:35.788 --> 04:54:35.798 align:start position:0%
if they have animals and any of that
 
04:54:37.628 --> 04:54:37.638 align:start position:0%
happening there's no way they would be
 
04:54:39.548 --> 04:54:39.558 align:start position:0%
doing that in New Hampshire without
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
certain license
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
they would have to have that um with
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
havadis all of that so we should be able
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:52.270 --> 04:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
information have you looked in you know
 
04:54:55.350 --> 04:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
has anybody looked into that piece of it
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
that's how we find the information
 
04:54:59.270 --> 04:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you believe because that's
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
licensing is key in stuff like that you
 
04:55:05.310 --> 04:55:05.320 align:start position:0%
can't be testing on on rats and mice
 
04:55:08.910 --> 04:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
without having certain Licensing in New
 
04:55:11.470 --> 04:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay I I you know I can't
 
04:55:13.590 --> 04:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
really comment on that but I what I do
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
know is that the last time we had a bill
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
in this legislature that dealt with
 
04:55:20.990 --> 04:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
animal testing was strong strong
 
04:55:23.070 --> 04:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
objections from Dartmouth College and
 
04:55:25.510 --> 04:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
and University of New Hampshire to and
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
they made sure that bill got amended it
 
04:55:29.788 --> 04:55:29.798 align:start position:0%
didn't pass but it would have passed
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
with the Amendments that they so they
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
cooperated and and they're they're
 
04:55:38.190 --> 04:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to uh I think tell us
 
04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
what they're doing if asked and uh
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
work toward
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
um a world where we're we're we're not
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
testing on animals when there are better
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and we can find out the
 
04:55:54.430 --> 04:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
information by uh other methods and that
 
04:55:56.910 --> 04:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
is what this comes down to and that is
 
04:55:58.030 --> 04:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
the kind of
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that Humane world for
 
04:56:03.470 --> 04:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
animals and other organizations like us
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
are working toward and and this bill is
 
04:56:08.230 --> 04:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
a small step in the right direction and
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
we will be coming and hopefully get your
 
04:56:13.190 --> 04:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
support for more comprehensive
 
04:56:16.110 --> 04:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
legislation soon that will make New
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a state that doesn't test on
 
04:56:18.080 --> 04:56:21.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a state that doesn't test on
animals

04:56:21.070 --> 04:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:24.070 --> 04:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily okay representative Scully
 
04:56:25.948 --> 04:56:25.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you for
 
04:56:28.110 --> 04:56:28.120 align:start position:0%
being here and giving testimony did you
 
04:56:30.150 --> 04:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
say that animal testing is occurring in
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yes do you have the
 
04:56:35.390 --> 04:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
information the reference and the
 
04:56:37.030 --> 04:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
sources that you could provide to the
 
04:56:39.390 --> 04:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
committee what I said and I can I can
 
04:56:41.310 --> 04:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
look into it further I'm sorry this is
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
all I have today is all right well
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrated need is always a a
 
04:56:47.948 --> 04:56:47.958 align:start position:0%
wonderful reason for passing a bill so
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you can find out and provide it to us
 
04:56:51.548 --> 04:56:51.558 align:start position:0%
it would be very much appreciated thank
 
04:56:55.150 --> 04:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
you okay okay representative King you
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
had a question thank you madam chair I I
 
04:56:59.750 --> 04:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm going to have an
 
04:57:01.628 --> 04:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask anybody who might
 
04:57:03.868 --> 04:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
know better I don't expect you to
 
04:57:06.910 --> 04:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily but I'm curious about how
 
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
much sway we would or how much force
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
this would have concerning um Federal
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
military bases CU I'm just thinking of
 
04:57:19.750 --> 04:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
like Fort Dietrich in Maryland and if if
 
04:57:23.230 --> 04:57:23.240 align:start position:0%
Maryland passed a bill similar to this
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
would the feds even even acknowledge it
 
04:57:28.430 --> 04:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know since it's on a since a lot of
 
04:57:30.708 --> 04:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
that testing is on a mil US military
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
base and I'm just wondering if our US
 
04:57:32.480 --> 04:57:33.670 align:start position:0%
base and I'm just wondering if our US
military

04:57:33.670 --> 04:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
military
 
04:57:36.070 --> 04:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
base they would they just totally ignore
 
04:57:38.350 --> 04:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
our bill I don't know I just I feel like
 
04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
especially considering a lot of the
 
04:57:43.110 --> 04:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
egregious animal testing happens on
 
04:57:45.750 --> 04:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
military bases I just think that they
 
04:57:48.110 --> 04:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
would probably just ignore our bill
 
04:57:50.590 --> 04:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
completely yeah I think if it's Federal
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
property it probably has different laws
 
04:57:56.590 --> 04:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
applying to the stuff that goes on there
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:03.510 --> 04:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
but it would I mean not not withstanding
 
04:58:05.510 --> 04:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
that question it's still worth uh
 
04:58:07.788 --> 04:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
passing legislation that b bans it
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.230 --> 04:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
so that begs the question what what
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
defines unnecessarily I mean you may be
 
04:58:20.670 --> 04:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
you may think something is unnecessary
 
04:58:22.990 --> 04:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
but the the reason why people are
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
testing on something so the definition
 
04:58:28.628 --> 04:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going by is when there is a when
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
there is a proven method to to to find
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
the same information that does not test
 
04:58:42.070 --> 04:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative H Haskins thank you
 
04:58:47.788 --> 04:58:47.798 align:start position:0%
madam chair I thought the answer to that
 
04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
question was going to be it's
 
04:58:51.910 --> 04:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary which is not the right
 
04:58:55.708 --> 04:58:55.718 align:start position:0%
adjective if you're talking about animal
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
testing for that species that's going to
 
04:59:01.270 --> 04:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
improve their lives it it would be
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
extrajudicial it you know we wouldn't
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
really call it unnecessary but um I
 
04:59:10.390 --> 04:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
agree that unnecessary is a fuzzy kind
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
of word well that's my that's how I'm
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
that's my characterization I don't think
 
04:59:16.990 --> 04:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's any in here anywhere
 
04:59:20.548 --> 04:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
sure okay I may be using the wrong word
 
04:59:24.548 --> 04:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:27.310 --> 04:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh any other questions from the
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee regarding this bill no thank
 
04:59:34.470 --> 04:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
you appreciate you coming and speaking
 
04:59:37.390 --> 04:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
with us uh zephen
 
04:59:54.150 --> 04:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.470 --> 04:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
yes sure
 
04:59:57.910 --> 04:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
no there you go okay now can everyone
 
05:00:01.150 --> 05:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
hear me yep okay great uh dear members
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is zephen I am
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
a law students speaking in strong
 
05:00:07.230 --> 05:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
support of
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
hb401 this bill is a common sense
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
measure that ures New Hampshire
 
05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are not forced to fund
 
05:00:15.270 --> 05:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
outdated unethical and inefficient
 
05:00:17.310 --> 05:00:17.320 align:start position:0%
product testing on Animals by
 
05:00:18.910 --> 05:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
eliminating State funding for these
 
05:00:20.430 --> 05:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
Practices New Hampshire can uphold
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility align its policies
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
with Federal advancements and encourage
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
the use of modern human relevant testing
 
05:00:27.840 --> 05:00:29.548 align:start position:0%
the use of modern human relevant testing
meth

05:00:29.548 --> 05:00:29.558 align:start position:0%
meth
 
05:00:32.750 --> 05:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
methods consumers today expect safe and
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
effective products but animal testing is
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
neither the best nor the most reliable
 
05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
way to ensure product safety
 
05:00:42.670 --> 05:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
traditional tests on rabbits mice and
 
05:00:44.750 --> 05:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
other animals fail to account for human
 
05:00:47.190 --> 05:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
biological differences often leading to
 
05:00:49.868 --> 05:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
misleading results many products that
 
05:00:52.230 --> 05:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
passed animal tests later cause harm to
 
05:00:54.430 --> 05:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
humans While others that might be safe
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
are needlessly discarded due to
 
05:00:58.190 --> 05:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
unreliable animal-based
 
05:01:00.750 --> 05:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
data at the same time taxpayers are
 
05:01:02.910 --> 05:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
funding these inefficient tests with
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
when Superior Alternatives already exist
 
05:01:08.990 --> 05:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
modern testing methods including human
 
05:01:11.070 --> 05:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
cell-based models mods computer
 
05:01:13.470 --> 05:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
simulations and artificial intelligence
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
driven toxicity screenings provide more
 
05:01:18.830 --> 05:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
efficient and accurate results without
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
the ethical concerns of animal
 
05:01:23.070 --> 05:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
suffering investing in these
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
Alternatives not only benefits consumers
 
05:01:27.708 --> 05:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
but also reduces wasteful spending on
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
methods that science has already
 
05:01:34.548 --> 05:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
outgrown um additionally federal policy
 
05:01:36.270 --> 05:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
makers have recognized the shortcomings
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
of animal testing and have acted
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
accordingly in 2022 Congress passed the
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
FDA modernization act 2.0 I believe that
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
that was a bipartisan measure taken by
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
Rand Paul and Corey Booker um so two um
 
05:01:52.430 --> 05:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
Senators who couldn't disagree with each
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
other more about everything else but
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
agreed on this
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
issue um and what that did was it
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
eliminated the federal mandate for
 
05:02:03.150 --> 05:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
animal testing and Drug development and
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
allowed companies to use more reliable
 
05:02:08.470 --> 05:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
Alternatives additionally the EPA has
 
05:02:10.430 --> 05:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
committed to phasing out chemical
 
05:02:13.830 --> 05:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
toxicity testing on mammals by 2035 in
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
favor of modern non-animal
 
05:02:20.190 --> 05:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
methods hb401 follows the same logic by
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
ensuring State resources are not wasted
 
05:02:24.750 --> 05:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
on Obsolete animal testing practices for
 
05:02:27.310 --> 05:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
Consumer products New Hampshire would
 
05:02:29.390 --> 05:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
would be uh would not be making a
 
05:02:30.948 --> 05:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
radical change it would simply be
 
05:02:32.670 --> 05:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
aligning itself with the direction
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
federal agencies are already taking and
 
05:02:37.270 --> 05:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
ensuring public funds are spent
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
wisely um beyond the financial
 
05:02:42.430 --> 05:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
scientific arguments hb401 also
 
05:02:44.670 --> 05:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
addresses a significant ethical ethical
 
05:02:46.830 --> 05:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
concern State funds should not be used
 
05:02:48.510 --> 05:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
to support unnecessary suffering of
 
05:02:51.430 --> 05:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
animals when viable Alternatives exist
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
major companies across Industries
 
05:02:55.230 --> 05:02:55.240 align:start position:0%
ranging from Cosmetics to household
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
products have already eliminated animal
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
testing in favor of more effective
 
05:03:01.310 --> 05:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
Humane Alternatives consumers
 
05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly support this shift with
 
05:03:06.390 --> 05:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
polling consistently showing that public
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
um that the public opposes taxpayer
 
05:03:11.030 --> 05:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
funded animal testing for non-medical
 
05:03:14.350 --> 05:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
purposes this bill does not prohibit any
 
05:03:15.910 --> 05:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
or does not prohibit all research
 
05:03:17.910 --> 05:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
involving animals it simply ensures that
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
state funds specifically are no longer
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
used to support an outdated and cruel
 
05:03:24.548 --> 05:03:24.558 align:start position:0%
practice when better methods are
 
05:03:27.310 --> 05:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
available so in conclusion
 
05:03:30.110 --> 05:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
hb401 is a practical and necessary
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
reform that ends taxpayer waste on
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
ineffective and unnecessary product
 
05:03:36.990 --> 05:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
testing on animals two aligns with New
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire policy uh with the federal
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
government shift towards Modern Life um
 
05:03:43.310 --> 05:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
modern testing methods and three
 
05:03:45.310 --> 05:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
encourages the superior Humane
 
05:03:47.310 --> 05:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that are more reliable for
 
05:03:49.548 --> 05:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
product safety uh this bill does not
 
05:03:51.868 --> 05:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
compromise consumer safety it actually
 
05:03:54.150 --> 05:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
strengthens it by promoting better
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
faster and more ethical testing methods
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support hb401 with OTP and
 
05:04:02.708 --> 05:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
ensure that New Hampshire moves forward
 
05:04:06.670 --> 05:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
with uh responsible modern and Humane
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
product testing policies um I I just
 
05:04:12.670 --> 05:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a quick postcript um I
 
05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
think that the reporting requirement
 
05:04:15.310 --> 05:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
here is
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
particularly uh important I I did a
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
foyer request um to the state uh trying
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out the questions that you all
 
05:04:25.708 --> 05:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
are asking about like where does this
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
money go is there any funding any of
 
05:04:30.350 --> 05:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
that um and the person who was
 
05:04:32.110 --> 05:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
completing my foyer request seemed to
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
not really know what to give me either
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
so I think that what this reporting
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
requirement will do will actually make
 
05:04:40.030 --> 05:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
it so that we know what's going on in
 
05:04:43.830 --> 05:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state um we don't actually have a a
 
05:04:46.270 --> 05:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
a reliable mechanism of that and so a
 
05:04:47.868 --> 05:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
big hope for this bill is that that
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism is created uh so with that
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions sure so Mr wood
 
05:04:55.590 --> 05:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming and testifying
 
05:04:58.750 --> 05:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
so how do we as legislators legislate
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
something that we don't know I mean if
 
05:05:04.510 --> 05:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
if it if we don't know whether this is
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
happening or not what's why would we
 
05:05:09.310 --> 05:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
legislate it thank you for the question
 
05:05:11.708 --> 05:05:11.718 align:start position:0%
and it's an excellent question um so
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's two reasons why you should pass
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
this bill even if we don't have all of
 
05:05:18.390 --> 05:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
the information one and most importantly
 
05:05:20.670 --> 05:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
it helps us get access to this
 
05:05:22.910 --> 05:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
information because once these um
 
05:05:24.990 --> 05:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
entities start reporting we'll be able
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
to know what's happening and where um to
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
a greater degree than we currently do
 
05:05:32.548 --> 05:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
and two assuming that not even a single
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
um there's not even a single instance of
 
05:05:37.670 --> 05:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
this happening in the state which I um I
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think is likely um it's still um
 
05:05:44.190 --> 05:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
a principle that the um that the
 
05:05:46.350 --> 05:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
citizens are on board with so there's no
 
05:05:48.750 --> 05:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
real downside in passing something like
 
05:05:51.070 --> 05:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
this even if the Practical impact is
 
05:05:53.868 --> 05:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
minimal but that being said I'm not
 
05:05:56.590 --> 05:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
going to um I'm not going to concede
 
05:05:58.350 --> 05:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
that the impact is minimal I think that
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
there is an impact there we just need to
 
05:06:03.230 --> 05:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
find out what it is so you testified you
 
05:06:06.150 --> 05:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
just said that um that you think it is
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire yeah where do
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
you think this is happening and do you
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
have any facility in mind do you have an
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
idea of that there is uh some facility
 
05:06:19.150 --> 05:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
receiving State funds that is doing
 
05:06:22.350 --> 05:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
these horrific uh tests on animals yeah
 
05:06:24.990 --> 05:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't specifically know
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
because like I said I did the foyer
 
05:06:30.310 --> 05:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
request um and they came back uh with
 
05:06:33.190 --> 05:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
kind of like an uncertain response of
 
05:06:35.070 --> 05:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
like oh well there's there's these
 
05:06:37.948 --> 05:06:37.958 align:start position:0%
things that they involve like tests on
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
animals but a lot of them seemed um
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
Medical in nature um and then a lot of
 
05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
them it was just unclear um so like I
 
05:06:49.510 --> 05:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
said there's not really a mechanism for
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
determining like who is actually doing
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
it um but I I would think that um it
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
would be the firms that we least expect
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
I mean um if anyone's following what's
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
happening on at the federal level we're
 
05:07:04.590 --> 05:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
seeing that they're doing all kinds of
 
05:07:06.990 --> 05:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
crazy spending um that we didn't even
 
05:07:09.150 --> 05:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
think was possible until it came to
 
05:07:09.160 --> 05:07:10.150 align:start position:0%
think was possible until it came to
light

05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
light
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm almost certain that
 
05:07:16.390 --> 05:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's something like this here as
 
05:07:19.830 --> 05:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
well okay any other questions seeing
 
05:07:21.788 --> 05:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for coming and
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
speaking with us this afternoon anybody
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
else I don't have any more pink
 
05:08:03.548 --> 05:08:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:06.070 --> 05:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I appreciate you doing
 
05:08:13.830 --> 05:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.830 --> 05:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so I'm Joan O'Brien and I'm
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
here representing the New Hampshire
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
animal rights league and we're in
 
05:08:22.670 --> 05:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
support of
 
05:08:24.868 --> 05:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
hb401 um because we support any
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that takes us one step
 
05:08:29.230 --> 05:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
further to ending any type of animal
 
05:08:32.590 --> 05:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
testing or or animal
 
05:08:35.670 --> 05:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
research I will Echo what Kurt arenburg
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
said and our kid Governor Jade we really
 
05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
need something more compreh prehensive
 
05:08:43.910 --> 05:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
than this um like uh Senate Bill 97
 
05:08:47.030 --> 05:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
which will Outlaw the the the testing of
 
05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
state 12 other states have this it's
 
05:08:55.708 --> 05:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
it's very popular with the public ask
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
anybody you know do you think we should
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
be testing mascara on bunnies and just
 
05:09:02.350 --> 05:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
about everybody will say no that's
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's terrible so it would be an easy
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
thing to
 
05:09:08.070 --> 05:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
pass what's harder to get people to
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
accept is the bi medical stuff because
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's sold is so important we need
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
to we're going to find a cure for cancer
 
05:09:17.548 --> 05:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
if we don't test on animals we won't be
 
05:09:20.030 --> 05:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
able to find that cure and a couple
 
05:09:21.548 --> 05:09:21.558 align:start position:0%
people have touched on the fact that a
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
lot of that biomedical research is is
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
frivolous um like for example we've got
 
05:09:29.990 --> 05:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh Federal rep mace her oversight
 
05:09:31.990 --> 05:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee is looking into some of these
 
05:09:34.830 --> 05:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
frivolous studies uh like the one where
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
they were testing um to see if if for
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
toxoplasmosis by feeding cats cat meat
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
um so they're finding all sorts of waste
 
05:09:47.470 --> 05:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
and the universities that get these
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
funds they get them every year it's
 
05:09:52.350 --> 05:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
really just a money grab so every year
 
05:09:54.510 --> 05:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
you come up with some proposals that
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
sound good so you continue to get the
 
05:09:59.070 --> 05:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
funding for your for your
 
05:10:01.150 --> 05:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
studies and I just wanted to put that
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
out there because everybody is always
 
05:10:06.030 --> 05:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
harping on the oh we have to exempt
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
biomedical research well just be be
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
aware that it's not all really going to
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.230 --> 05:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
humans uh so it seem it seems to me that
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
what we've come down to the two places
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
that might be actually state funded and
 
05:10:26.788 --> 05:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
doing testing not biomedical research
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
testing are the Diagnostic lab and the
 
05:10:33.150 --> 05:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
animal science program at UNH um I don't
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
know if they are testing I thought the
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
lab was mostly forensics I could be
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
wrong with the study that um rep pix was
 
05:10:45.310 --> 05:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
talking about with the cows to see if
 
05:10:47.868 --> 05:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
different feed is more nutritious and
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
produces less carbon I know that they
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
just put a canula in the side of the cow
 
05:10:55.548 --> 05:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
it's like a window and then they feed
 
05:10:57.910 --> 05:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
them things and they they watch I don't
 
05:11:00.670 --> 05:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
know if that qualifies as product
 
05:11:03.390 --> 05:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
testing it's not that invasive but it's
 
05:11:05.070 --> 05:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat invasive I would say it's
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:12.670 --> 05:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:15.070 --> 05:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
lastly why you know why should why
 
05:11:17.830 --> 05:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
should animal testing and it's bad
 
05:11:21.030 --> 05:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
science um great advances have been made
 
05:11:23.788 --> 05:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
for example we can test skin irritation
 
05:11:25.788 --> 05:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
rather than you know putting CTIC
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
chemicals onto rabbits with um we've got
 
05:11:32.750 --> 05:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
we we can create skin from real human
 
05:11:35.590 --> 05:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
tissue and we can test on that and it's
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
more reliable it's more predictive of
 
05:11:39.788 --> 05:11:39.798 align:start position:0%
what would happen on a human being and
 
05:11:43.310 --> 05:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:45.548 --> 05:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
economical so in facilitating the
