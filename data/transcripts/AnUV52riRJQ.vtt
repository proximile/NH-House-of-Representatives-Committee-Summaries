morning I'd like to read a brief
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
statement on behalf of the the members
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
here in environment and agriculture we'd
 
00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
like to take a moment to acknowledge the
 
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 align:start position:0%
passing of a former member of
 
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture The

Honorable Suzanne Smith who served in
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
Ena from 2009 to
 
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan consensus in all that she did
 
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.149 align:start position:0%
bipartisan consensus in all that she did
most

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
recently uh she came before the
 
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee to
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
teach us and the public about
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
establishing a fund to treat cyano
 
00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
bacteria in New Hampshire Lakes it
 
00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
passed as a result the funds and an
 
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
advisory committee were signed into law
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that effort will continue on house
 
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture is grateful
 
00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
for her service and dedication to New
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and making the environment
 
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
better for us
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
all with that I'd like to have a moment
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
of silence in her memory can I yes
 
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bigby so um when Suzanne
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
was uh already a leader when I came when
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
I first came in 2012 13 uh and uh I
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
really looked up to her as a mentor
 
00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 align:start position:0%
through the whole time that she was here
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
in the house um she was really good at
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh getting beyond the partisan divide
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
and uh de and getting people to work
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
towards practical Solutions and that
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
that um that drive towards finding a
 
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
practical solution uh was something that
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
I really admired in her and I try to
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
follow that
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
example representative kraton yeah thank
 
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that sort of hits hard I'm sorry
 
00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 align:start position:0%
I didn't know that um Suzanne Smith uh
 
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
obvious was the was the Democratic head
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
of the rr&amp;d during the last term um but
 
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
I learned a ton from her on how to get
 
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
things done in a committee and uh if you
 
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
just look at the way she conducted
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
herself and and that the way that she
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
was able to uh as representative Bixby
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
said cut through sort of political um
 
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
divides and come to reasonable Solutions
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
she was she was a master at that and I'm
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
really sorry hear that uh really
 
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.790 align:start position:0%
really sorry hear that uh really
tremendous

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
lady thank you and I'd just like to have
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.790 align:start position:0%

you
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
our first bill to be heard this morning
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
is hb1
 
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
1293 and I would like to open up that
 
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
hearing and welcome representative ball
 
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
to introduce this bill to our committee
 
00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:28.390 align:start position:0%
to introduce this bill to our committee
good

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.469 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Lori ball and I
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
am a representative from Salem thank you
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to present this very
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
important bill that addresses one facet
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
in our fight against CYO bacteria that
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
is plaguing New Hampshire lakes and
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
ponds for the past several
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%

public water bodies or storm drains that
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
carry contaminated water into many lakes
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
and ponds in fact according to the 2016
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire guide to storm water
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
management excess storm water runoff
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem as the runoff can
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
carry pollution into lakes ponds and
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
streams and Coastal Waters making them
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
unsafe for swimming and creating an

to excess nutrients that build up plant

and algae growth including cob bacteria
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
which can harm humans and animals and be
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
a nuisance for swimming and boating
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
these nutrients can decrease the amount
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
of oxygen in the water as plants die and
 
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
decompose this means
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
many this means less oxygen is available
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
for fish and other organisms they can
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
also increase bacteria that can make

efforts to control nutrient inputs are
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%

achieve the goals of that plan the

report stated and I quote the primary
 
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
focus should be on the reduction of
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%

and Massachusetts these measures are
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
designed to curtail phosphorus overload
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
in Lakes Pond streams and rivers the
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
cost of implementing these measures
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
would be minimal and clearly doable as
 
00:09:58.509 --> 00:09:58.519 align:start position:0%
given other states have already enacted
 
00:09:58.519 --> 00:09:59.670 align:start position:0%

electronically if that's easier oh well
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
whatever paper yeah the paper copine I
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
found a couple typos so I'll have to
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
correct those first sorry no worries
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee um representative sofikitis
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
please how widespread are the is the use
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
of phosphorus how how much of the
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
um supply of fertilizers have phosphorus
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
in them
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
currently phosphorus INF fertilizer in
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is technically illegal um
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're only allowed to have 67% of
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
phosphorus in the fertilizer and the way
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
the fertilizer companies when they
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
package it they only report in whole
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
numbers so that middle number when they
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
put the um nitrogen phosphorus and I
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
think pottassium that number is always
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
zero so on a average you know if you
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put fertilizer on your
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
lawn um it would say zero on those
 
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
phosphorus bags however if you are doing
 
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
new um a new lawn or
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
um some other some other things that we
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
specified in the bill then you could use
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
phosphorus that has
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
fertilizer the concern is more that we
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
have setbacks when we live on the lakeef
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
fronts we have setbacks of the 25 ft
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
that we can't put any any fertilizer
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
close to the lake because of the runoff
 
00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
but in in the case of in particular in
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
Salem on Arlington p Pond our Watershed
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
goes out could be a mile but all of
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
those other homes that don't have
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
setbacks from the waters and the streams
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
or the storm drains all that water ends
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
up going in and in in Arlington it dumps
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
directly into Arlington Pond there is no
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
holding place for it everything dumps
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
directly into the pond um and as a
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
result our pond was shut I think all of
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
but three weeks this summer we shut down
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
in may we opened up mid June we shut
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
down again I think it was on July 28th
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
and we did not reopen until November 8th
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
or 10th as a matter of fact we opened
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
just before they start pulling the water
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
from our pond to become to go to the
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
water treatment because we are the
 
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
water treatment because we are the
secondary

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
secondary
 
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
Reservoir representative Bixby yes um
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and uh
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this bill in uh I
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
think it's very important I just wanted
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
to get a clarification on a couple of
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
things um uh one is um the when you when
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
you B say no fertilizer can be applied
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh you're talking about uh turf
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
fertilizer right yes and that was the
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
one thing in the bill that we need to
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
specify that it's um phosphorus
 
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
fertilizers with
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
phosphorus follow up follow up go ahead
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
yeah so there are a number of a number
 
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
of agricultural fertilizers which have a
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
lot more phosphorus than uh than Turf
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
fertilizers those are are not intended
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
for application on uh on on Turf
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
obviously um but uh the in SE on page
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
two section six of the bill um
 
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
application of fertilizers containing
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
phosphorus is prohibited during Heavy
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
Rain or when Heavy Rain is predicted or
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
on saturated ground or from October 15
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
to April 1st including applications by
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
professionals so uh am I correct in
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
reading that that that that is that is
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
any fertilizer that contains phosphorus
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
not merely Turf fertilizers that are um
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
period I am was thinking in terms of
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
phosphorus um fertilizer when writing
 
00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
this and um
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
the side farms and those agricultural
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
things for gardening agricultural golf
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
courses they're all exempt from this
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay um okay so I
 
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
okay um okay so I
guess

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh I I I was what I'm what I'm not sure
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
of is whether the
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
exemption uh is covers the
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
application uh during that prohibition
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
period or whether that whether the
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
exemption is during the normal season
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
applying that I went by the other laws
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
and how they were written written with
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
the idea that we would not be applying
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
any fertilizer to frozen ground because
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
it would just run off right so I guess
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
my the point of my question is uh do we
 
00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:16.839 align:start position:0%
not do we want to prevent application of
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
any fertilizer including agricultural
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
fertilizers that contain phosphorus
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
periods to be totally transparent I I
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
was advised not to include these areas
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
because the possibility of passing the
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill would be much smaller if we
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
included saying that for agricultural
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
reasons you can't apply I maybe I'm Mis
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm still misunderstanding you or okay
 
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
okay I I um
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
um I think the the key of my question is
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
that um um there seems to be a an
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
ambiguity between whether the exemption
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
is uh for uh for phosphorus fertilizer
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
is um uh carries over to section six
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
where it says that um applications are
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
prohibited during Heavy Rain Etc uh
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and I would my my personal
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
feeling is that it probably makes sense
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
to limit any application of phosphorus
 
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
during that period because you can run
 
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
run off Farmland as well as you can run
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
off um or run off a golf course as well
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
as you can run off uh ordinary Turf uh
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
so uh I just want to have a
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
clarification about whether the intent
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
was to limit the application of all
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
phosphorus for those times when it can
 
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
plants the intent was that it should not
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
be applied when the ground is frozen and
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
it cannot get into the ground any
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
fertilizer should not be
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
um this particularly says application of
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
fertilizers containing phosphorus are
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited during heavy rains okay thank
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry if I'm still not
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
understanding your question no I I think
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
I think you you've answered that is is
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to not applying
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
during those conditions it doesn't
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
matter whether it's a labeled as turf
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
fertilizer or or whether it's um you
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
know yes whether it you anything that
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
has phosphorus shouldn't be applied when
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
it's going to inevitably run off yes
 
00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
that would be exactly what I'm talking
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
about because whether it comes from a
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
golf course or agriculture it's going to
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
end up in our stream so we want them to
 
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
apply it during the proper times right
 
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Katon yeah I'm
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
sorry just to make sure I heard what you
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
said so there are no exemptions for six
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
so those
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
those uh seven exceptions in in
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
five they they're not accepted in six
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
they've got to comply with six they
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
cannot those people golf courses cannot
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
apply fertilizer when the ground is
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
Frozen yes okay um I have a a question
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh on paragraph seven and we last term
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
we looked at uh rodeno sites and one of
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
the issues was the how do you prevent
 
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
going on Amazon and ordering Foss
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
for fertili fertilizers how how how does
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
seven get implemented is that is there
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
any accountability to that
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
or considering I in my mind I was
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
thinking how California has so many uh
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
restrictions and it's just not allowed
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
to be um sent into their so however they
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
would do it it would be the same we just
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
it would not be allowed okay so there
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be a restriction put in place and
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure on the mechanisms I
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
assume there were mechanisms already in
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
place for restrictions yeah okay thank
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.510 align:start position:0%
you representative
Duty

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
Duty
 
00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.830 align:start position:0%
Duty
uh

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
yeah somebody has to shut that
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
yeah now you're on I was on all the time
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
oh I didn't know that look at that okay
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
um this goes back to section four uh
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
basically lines four five and six and I
 
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
just didn't understand so it says
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
display nonphosphorus fertilizer
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
separately from phosphorus in the retail
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
area where phosphorus fertilizer is
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
accessible by a consumer and I didn't
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
understand why that was necessary or
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
what the object objective of that was
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of that is to um better
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
educate the consumer to make sure that
 
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
they don't mix up the two fertilizers
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
and pick up one rather than the other so
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
the idea is just a separate area would
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
mean a separate shelf or a separate um
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily a location but just to
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
separate them so they're not next to
 
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
each other there's also um the posting
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
of the sign um to allow again this goes
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
back to one of the things that was
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the um Department of
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
environment Services action plan was
 
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
that we needed more ways of educating
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
the public in New Hampshire the majority
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
of properties do not even need
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
phosphorus in fact if you just left your
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
grass clippings there you would have
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
enough phosphorus on your lawn you don't
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
need to add anything so we're really
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
trying to educate the public and the
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
purpose for separating those whether
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
they're on different shelves or on one
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle and then the other
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
side is just to make sure that we're
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
educating um and letting the the public
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
know that there are two distinct reasons
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
for buying the fertilizer and if you're
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
not EST establishing a new lawn then
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's not the fer then you should not
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
fertilizer uh represent uh
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um and
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so I
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
think going back to the comment that um
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
the vice chair um uh representative
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
kraton had brought up regarding the
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
online sales um is that something that
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
you would be open to enumerating who
 
00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:27.799 align:start position:0%
would have oversight there in the event
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
that because right now it's not very
 
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
clear as to who would be
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
um caring for the oversight of the
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
online sale portion and and to
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative craton's point we did
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
hear in a previous piece of legislation
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
around oversight and some of the
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
complexities around that so I'm just
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
curious if that I'm more than willing to
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
amend this in order to um better Serve
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
the People and to address the io
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
bacteria problems I can certainly talk
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
to legislative Services the researchers
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
to find out if there is something that
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
we can add to
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
this okay representative
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative Paul for uh taking my
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
question uh to return to uh page two
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
section six that uh representative Bixby
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
was referring to uh previously uh this
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
prohibition during Heavy Rain or or when
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
Heavy Rain is predicted uh and then so
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
this presumably covers both private
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and and including uh
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
applications by professionals and so I'm
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
wondering what kind of enforcement
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
mechanism are we are we talking about
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
professionals who are applying
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
fertilizers there are ways to to
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
restrict or to
 
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
regulate how professionals do these
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
things right because they have to be
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
licensed or there are various ways of
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
doing that but um how would we you know
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
what enforcement mechanism is there when
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
we're talking about private individuals
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
who are also that applies then below
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
with putting it you know you shouldn't
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
be putting it on a hard surface where
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
it's going to run off but my question is
 
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
what enforcement mechanisms are there
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about private
 
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
individuals it would be the same
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanisms that are in place
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
right now saying that we have to have a
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
setback from the water which I'm going
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
to tell you is not enforcable so the
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
only thing that this bill really does is
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
going to rely on people's honesty and
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
being educated through the bill and the
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
um commercial people that are putting
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
this down I would imagine if complaints
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
came in and said hey they just put
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
fertilizer on my property and it's
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
pouring rain and and complaints go in we
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
would be looking a lot closer at their
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
lure so I think it's the same thing I
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
know that I have a lawn company that
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
does fertilizer on my property and I
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
know that when it's raining they
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
much anyone is oh represent
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
Dan thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question I wonder if the Farm
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau has weighed in on this at all if
 
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
you've gotten any input from them I have
 
00:25:04.029 --> 00:25:04.039 align:start position:0%
not okay thank
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
you and I have not received any written
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
testimony from them as well
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby uh additionally I
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you have consulted the
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture because
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
they're actually the ones who are in
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
charge of enforcing fertilizer
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
regulations I did not I was um the
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
guidance I was given was to talk to the
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and the person I spoke to was
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
the person who wrote the original bill
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
that um that restricted phosphorus um in
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
the fertilizers okay great thank
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you for taking my question I
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
know you're not a scientist but I would
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
just could you speak to a little bit
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
about um the chemical reaction that
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
takes place with the phosphorus that
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
increases the cob bacteria I grew up on
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
a lake ever since you know I was was uh
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
born we had a summer home and it's a
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
huge problem um you know it was one of
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
the cleanest Lakes but not anymore in
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um you know and it's
 
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.590 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um you know and it's
interesting

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
because there I never knew anything
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
about this at all um until I met this
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman that had that did Lawns and he
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
told me about that and the natural piece
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
of this so could you speak to like what
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
transpires that causes
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
this as you said
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
I acknowledge I am not a scientist
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
however in my reading the phosphorus
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
helps to develop the root systems is
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
what I was told and so that's you know
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to put on our plants
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
to make them healthy and strong and have
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
good root systems um and that's what
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
happens when it gets into the water that
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
the bacteria that's in there the plants
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
in there including invasive plants are
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
going to overtake um the water and once
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
you it's going to just end up depleting
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
the oxygen it just becomes a cycle of
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
killing the lake off
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
Bixby I do not see anybody from any of
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
our agencies uh listed as someone who is
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
talk um representative
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.590 align:start position:0%
talk um representative
ktoa

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
ktoa
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um a couple
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
questions uh if I may um the date here
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
in section six
 
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:41.799 align:start position:0%
um October 15 through April
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
1st um is that a date that's already in
 
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
law somewhere
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
else all of the um information that I
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
put in was already part of um what other
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
states did when I looked in especially
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
into Maine when I I pulled their laws so
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
everything that is written here is a
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
combination of what the other states
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
around us are doing including Vermont
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine follow up follow
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
up go ahead so it's not in New Hampshire
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
up go ahead thank you and thank you
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question so I
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
understand that October 15th uh
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
technically the ground is crowen uh the
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
ground is frozen but lately with the way
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
the climate has been um we're still able
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
to work the fields in October and I
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
think um putting in a date um based on
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
how things are going might be a uh
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
harm uh folks because people in in
 
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
agriculture um if they're needing to
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:57.909 align:start position:0%
 
time

00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:28:59.389 --> 00:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's saying that it can't
 
00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
be applied it's saying it can't be
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
applied if it's saturated or Frozen no
 
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
or from October 15 through April
 
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.669 align:start position:0%
or from October 15 through April
1st

00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
1st
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay we can certainly I can certainly
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
amend that to say um between that time
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
period again I went by um Vermont and in
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh it's prohibited from October
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
16th to March 31st on Frozen Ground so
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we just I can amend it to
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
clarify followup go ahead thank you
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair um now what concerned me a
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
little bit in your testimony well in in
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
answering the questions is this is being
 
00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
answering the questions is this is being
targeted

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
um to homeowners basically to the
 
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.110 align:start position:0%
um to homeowners basically to the
private

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
citizen however um you kind of alluded
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
that it could be more you it was um you
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
inferred that you had to water it down
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
um and exclude um agricultural use and
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
gardening uh so that this bill get
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
passed my question to you is
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh and gardening rely
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
heavily on phosphorus uh NPK uh the
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
three that you were talking about
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
specifically uh in order to make sure
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
that they uh can grow their crops
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
and uh feed the populace of New
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what I'm concerned about
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
is at some future point we may end up
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
going down the road of banning it for
 
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
those purposes um based on what you
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
stated do you see that
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
happening I mean there's a possibility
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
that that could happen I believe that
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
the intent of not including agricultural
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
use or golf courses for management um is
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
because we're dealing with people who
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
are running their business and who um
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
follow the laws and they know how to
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
apply these uh chemicals in an
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate manner it is the general
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
public that I'm concerned about who do
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
not apply it in appropriate Manner and
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
are not educated on the impact of when
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
they put fertilizer and it over spills
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
onto their driveway and they just push
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
it down the storm drain that they're not
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
understanding where the storm drain
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
actually goes to and where it disperses
 
00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:30.519 align:start position:0%
its water so my hope would be that if um
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
golf course and agriculture are using
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
these that they are very well educated
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
in how to appropriate appropriately
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
apply uh chemicals um so that it does
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
not hurt the
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
environment representative ktoa you had
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
another question and then representative
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
NAB just just a follow basic followup in
 
00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:54.519 align:start position:0%
thank you again oh uh sorry about that
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh just a basic followup to to your
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
answer is so basically what you're
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
saying and what I'm hearing here is this
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
is an education Bill we need to educate
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
the consumer and you're using this as a
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
way to educate people well that's only
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
one facet is to educate them but we
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
still need to put the restrictions okay
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative NAB thank you
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I would think that part
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
six is something that is um self-evident
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you would not apply fertilizer if
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
the was frozen and not going to take it
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
in or if it was going to run off and be
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
useless and that commercial applicators
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
would in particular understand that but
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
I think it would be helpful to get some
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
input from the Farm Bureau and or the
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture um just to
 
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
make sure the fact that they haven't
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
emailed about this bill makes me think
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
that it's not a concern but I think it
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to have their input on
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
that because it will have an impact on
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
Farmers absolutely than you
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
another uh sort of um
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
and be good unclear area is um whether
 
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh the you uh whether the use of uh
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
phosphorus in a greenhouse would count
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
as an
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
application and uh I think that the the
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
bill should directly address have
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
something specific to indicate uh how
 
00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:20.200 align:start position:0%
this how phosphorus should be managed in
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
green houses and if this if this
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
prohibition affects that because uh
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
during you know
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
unlike the uh the outside applications
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
which people aren't applying phosphorus
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
right now uh it's uh
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
but uh but um at least outside but
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
people are using phosphorus and Green
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
Houses because it's an important
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
nutrient for Greenhouse plants uh it's
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's a controlled environment but we
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
might want to have something in here
 
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
that addresses the fact that Greenhouse
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
applications are not uh affected by this
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
bill would you
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
agree well it says gardening but I could
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
certainly add in um Greenhouse gardening
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
right but I think so the it's the EXE
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
the exemptions that are listed in five
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't uh cover six the way that the bill
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
is written uh where so uh there for six
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
would need to have a specific exemption
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh indicating that green houses don't
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
have that seasonal restriction
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
oh I see what you're saying yes okay
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh I I also have a concern
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
um in in the list of um
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
exemptions that we don't include um
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities who may need to apply
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
fertilizer to Parks uh Recreation
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
areas well they can if the soil is
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
tested and they see that it's phosphorus
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
deficit otherwise there would be no
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
reason to be applying it okay but I
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
mean you've outlined a few of the other
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
exemptions specifically for gardening
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
agricultural use I would think U
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
municipal use would also be something
 
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:15.079 align:start position:0%
that would be Exempted again this is
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to even on these ex exemptions um
 
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
um I I just think if you're talking
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
about parks that before before they
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
would be applying anything they would be
 
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
checking to see what exactly is needed
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
and that would be that they would do a
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
soil sample to see that there's a
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
phosphorous def deficit and then they
 
00:35:41.069 --> 00:35:41.079 align:start position:0%
would go ahead and put that um use those
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
fertilizers so why wouldn't the same
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
logic be applied to golf
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
courses it certainly could
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
be okay thank you we can certainly add
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
that and amend
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
it any other questions from the
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.589 --> 00:36:02.599 align:start position:0%
smart I have to think how to formulate
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
it as a question thank you madam chair
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
um you have down exemptions first of all
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
I think um you said in the beginning
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire the state of New
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prohibits phosphorus in its
 
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
fertilizers up to0
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
67% or after that and there's and
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's no way to enforce it so what's
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill if we can't
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
enforce it and there's already a rule
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
that you can't have phosphorus in your
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
fertilizer because even even phosphorus
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
with 67 or even fertilizer with 67% is
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
still going to even that at that minimal
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
amount if it goes into our storm drains
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
and ends up in our Watershed which ends
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
up in our Lakes is going to cause harm
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
which is why when you abut a lake you
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
can't put Point s you can't put any
 
00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
fertilizer within 25 ft regardless so um
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
agriculture um like my husband does
 
00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
haying he has 100 foot setback so why is
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
it 25 ft for a homeowner but 100 set
 
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
foot setb for Farms the 25 foot is
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
already set in law I don't know the
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
answer for
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
that don't you think it's a little bit
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
like it should be the same for everybody
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
I was going to increase it to 50 feet
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
and then I said I in my head I was just
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
like if the law already says 25 ft I
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
would leave it to what the current law
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
states and there's no mention I'm sorry
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
can I another there's no mention of um
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
Road uh Highway departments a lot of
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
times with the ditching with the highway
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
departments I mean your house is a mile
 
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
away but you're up on a hill and that
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
water runs down over the hill over the
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
road and down into the lake say Alton
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
area um
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
there's no I don't see any provision in
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
here that educates the highway
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
department on how to maintain the roads
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
to keep the runoff from going into the
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
Lakes number one and number two I think
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners my personal feeling
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
on um runoff from your home if you own
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
property around the lake that there
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
should be some sort of a filtration
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
system put in to keep the a natural
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
filtration system not one that you know
 
00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
um to keep
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
this fil filter the water before it gets
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
into the lake so it's a a landowner's
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
problem well that's the whole purpose of
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
that the people who live on the lake are
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
doing the correct thing we are we have
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
ways of mitigating or putting um you
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
know like at my house in particular the
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
water when it runs across my yard then
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
goes into a bunch of stone before it
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
would enter the lake so it has time to
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
dissipate into the soil um with regard
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
to the highway I would think that um
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
I I won't say I find it hard to believe
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
but I'd be very disappointed if the
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
highway system when they create those
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
ditches are not creating it to catch the
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
water and have the water then filtrate
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
through the ground and not run directly
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
into the lake as I said our concern at
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
least in the Salem area is that our
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
storm drains regardless if you're in the
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
Watershed which is huge um it doesn't
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
matter where you where you live if
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
you're not using the precautions that we
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
on the Laker are being that we have to
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
use and the setbacks all that same water
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
is just going to run into the storm
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
drains and go directly in I mean I wish
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
that there was a a law in place that
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually said all Waters in a storm
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
drain have to go into a holding so that
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
it then has to dissipate and filter
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
through the ground instead of running
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
directly but that apparently is not in
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
place in New Hampshire because I know we
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
have about 20 uh storm drain Outlets
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
Lake okay um did I I'm sorry did I not
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
answer the question no you answered that
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
fine I'm just wondering why not make
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
this because we don't have storm rain
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
catch Basin right now and I would think
 
00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
that would be a he a lot more expensive
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
and to push onto towns where they don't
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
have the property I think that they have
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
no areas to put those catch Basin I
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
think a lot of times when we write laws
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
um that have to do with Lakes We tend to
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
think of the North country and people
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
who have acreage around Arlington Pond
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
we have our lots are 50 feet by 100 feet
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
so we don't have a lot of space down
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
there and we don't have any public um
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
access access to the beaches or to the
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
lake um and so some of the things that
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're you know that we apply for the
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
lakes in the North Region of our state
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
where they have a lot of property um and
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
you come down to the southern region
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
where we have a much more congested
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
environment we don't have the areas to
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
put in these catch basins or um you know
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
the same it it can't be kind of I guess
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
a one-size fits all and again I go back
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
to the report that was just written and
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
it specifically said that we need to
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
address the phosphorus coming into um
 
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.510 align:start position:0%
address the phosphorus coming into um
the

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
waters I don't know if everybody had I
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
would I sorry I just assumed everyone
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
had already seen that report it just
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
came out in November representative
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yes thank you madam chair um I
 
00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
just want to if this bill b gets passed
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
and it only educates people about
 
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
phosphorous on their lawns I think it's
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
done a a service also it will open up
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for homeowners to have
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
more options and getting zero phosphorus
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
fertilizer um but uh as a member of the
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
nashwa Conservation Commission one of
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
the things that I have seen is that
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
people need to be educated
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
that Lawns um serve absolutely no
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
purpose in the environment other than to
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
make people feel good when they look out
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
their window or to give people something
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
to do on the weekends when they get on
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
their riding
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
lawnmower uh so we have been trying to
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
encourage people to limit the size of
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
their lawns uh and to populate it with
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
um plants that uh are native to New
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that will provide
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
substance and food for our Wildlife so I
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
just want to say that I appreciate this
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
bill um you know it looks like it needs
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit of work but it doesn't
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
appear to me to be anything that will
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
kill it and I'm hoping that our
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee will do its due diligence on
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much thank
 
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
you okay if we have no other questions
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
from the committee we can move on we've
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
got five other people who would like to
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
speak and they have indicated did two to
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
three minutes each which would be good
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
so uh I would like to call Joanne
 
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
so uh I would like to call Joanne

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
to our testimony table good
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
morning and I see you are from Dees I'm
 
00:43:46.359 --> 00:43:47.549 align:start position:0%
morning and I see you are from Dees I'm
from

00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
the microphone
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
please I'm I'm from I'm a representative
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
of the Kizer Lake protective Association
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
which is in Sutton New Hampshire um
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
that's a a small Lake it's um
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 182 Acres average depth of
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
9 ft but when we say 9 ft there's areas
 
00:44:10.829 --> 00:44:10.839 align:start position:0%
that are 27 feet there's areas that are
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
2 feet or less so it's a very small Lake
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
and um um I want to talk a little bit
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
one of your uh Representatives mentioned
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
about the science um when you have a a
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
small Lake uh it's very shallow you know
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
in certain areas and the sunlight hits
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the lake which encourages
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
plant growth so there's actually a
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
difference between ponds and lakes ponds
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
usually are called ponds because
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
technically they the sunlight hits the
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
bottom of the lake all the time before
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
you go on are you affiliated with
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental services at
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
all no I'm not okay thank you okay so
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
but basically um um the phosphorus
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
encourages photosynthesis that's the
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
whole thing okay so the phosphorus and
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and all that collects in there
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
it encourages photosynthesis
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
photosynthesis the light right the
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
plants absorb the light and grow and of
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
course um they can grow to excess
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
depending on how much ph phosphorus or
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
nitrogen they have so if there if if
 
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
there's tons of phosphorus in in lakes
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
and ponds plant growth is going to
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
exponentially grow and what happens is
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
photosynthesis actually removes the
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
carbon and but produces the oxygen um
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
and what um what happens is um when the
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
plants uh which is great for fish that's
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
why there's some plants in there it's
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
great for fish and it's it's gung-ho but
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
what happens is if there's overgrowth it
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
actually um it it covers the top of the
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
lake so like algae you know sign of
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
bacteria all those um um plants they it
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
covers the top of the lake what happens
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
is if it covers the top of the lake um
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
it reduces the surface area of the lake
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
so it the lake can't absorb oxygen so
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
when the lake can't absorb oxygen all
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
the other fish and all the other
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
creatures that are in that Lake die
 
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
because now there's no Oxygen so that's
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
why it's so important to decrease the
 
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
phosphorous from all the lakes and the
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
ponds and um and one of um one of one of
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
the things that um you uh you mentioned
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
that um the education is really really
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
important because people don't
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
understand that and in New Hampshire I
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know I actually live on Kar Lake um
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
we've had an influx of new population
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
they don't understand um the laws or the
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
or understand the lake period um and
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot more construction so
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
if there's more construction there's
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
been more you know growing of grass and
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
and and using uh fertilizers so we're
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
seeing um uh we ker lake has been
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
monitored very um seriously because in
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
the 70s it was one of the lakes that was
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
heavily polluted Ed and actually came
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
back it's a success story and it came
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
back and it's wonderful now but we have
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
noticed in this particular Lake um an
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
increase in C
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and we we believe it's
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
possibly um you know the phosphorus and
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
also uh we have a beach on our small
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
Lake and so an influx of more people on
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
the beach as well so the phosphorus and
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
nitrogen all that is is is increasing
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh food that Source I
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say food but the source that
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
the plants needs these minerals to to um
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
have photosynthesis and because of the
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
fact that it is so shallow it it it can
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
be a problem and we just want to protect
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
it but it's not just for ker Lake uh you
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
know it we know that like for instance
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
her Pond and things and other lakes in
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are experiencing all the
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
same thing and so um so we do support
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
this bill ke Lake Protection Association
 
00:47:55.349 --> 00:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
does support this bill and um I don't
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
want to take take too much long of the
 
00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:58.839 align:start position:0%
process I'm I'm already at 3 minutes so
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%

Laro the president of New Hampshire
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
Lakes uh I have a testimony letter
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
coming around New Hampshire Lakes we're
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
a Statewide nonprofit organization our
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
mission is to restore and preserve the
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
health of our Lakes we represent about
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
275 local Lake Associations and
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
thousands of uh res uh Lake enthusiasts
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um there's been
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
great discussion um and I think you you
 
00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:00.799 align:start position:0%
all understand um or have heard about
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
the connection of phosphorus and
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and water quality I would
 
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
like to also let you know I served on
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee that advised the
 
00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services in
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
developing the plan to address
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria the toxic blooms that are
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
increasing in our Lakes increasing in
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
severity and frequency that report was
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
published in November
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
2023 this spill is Con consistent with
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
that um the action plan of that um
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations of that plan and in the
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
interest of time I just wanted to focus
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
in on uh kind of one aspect here uh last
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
week I testified in front of the State
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh the Senate finance committee they're
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
considering a $1 million appropriation
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
to the cyano bacteria mitigation loan
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
and Grant fund which is set up to
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
provide loans and grants to local Lake
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
Associations municipalities and water
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
suppliers to implement uh projects to
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
reduce uh the contributors to uh toxic
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms in our lakes and uh
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
the Senate finance committee um did
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
their due diligence and asked me a
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
number of questions and one of the
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
questions one they expressed some um
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
reservation about investing in the fund
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
you know and I'm paraphrasing here um
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
putting a Band-Aid on the problem
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
instead of really addressing the sources
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
and they asked me what is the state what
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
are you doing about
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and so um of course I let
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
them know about this bill and uh we do
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill would get at uh
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
sort of the lwh hanging fruit of
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
phosphorous contri um pollution to our
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
Lakes um and New Hampshire Lakes we run
 
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
an education program Statewide it's
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
called uh lak smart we work with
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
residents to implement lak friendly
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
things they can do on their property to
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
um help uh reduce their negative impact
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
on the lake we have come in contact with
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of homeowners over the past
 
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
four or five years so that program and I
 
00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
will tell you um very low understanding
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
of how to properly apply fertilizer and
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
the negative impacts fertilizer can
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
cause and you know a prevailing thought
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
that you know more is better when it
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
comes to fertilizer and um so I think
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
that through the Lakes smart program we
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
have come into contact with thousands
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
you know a couple thousand homeowners
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but there are
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of
 
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
homeowners throughout the state that my
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
small team can't possibly um you know
 
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
connect one-on-one with to talk about
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
the problems of fertilizer so I do think
 
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
that um if we can put in a law that
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
provides more educational opportunities
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
for these homeowners who do want to do
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
the right thing and protect their
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
investment coupled with Ed increased
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
education and expanding the program that
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes is doing I think
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win and um that's what I have
 
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
to say I appre I vote urge you to vote
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
out to pass um on this bill and I would
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions thank
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative Murray
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would it be safe
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
to say that this bill is one of a
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
two-pronged approach so to speak in
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
addressing the compound effects of uh
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
phosphorus runoff it sounds like from
 
00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
the original Bill's uh sponsor testimony
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
that there's a compounding effect when
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
it comes from other locations and then
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
it kind of trickles down into the lake
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
but then also um the other sort of arm
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
that you're speaking about would be
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
funding as individual remediation
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
efforts per Lake are quite expensive yes
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
okay okay so this is sort of one of one
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
of those one of the two-prong approach
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
so to speak yes I thank you for the
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
question yes thank
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning thank you and I
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
would Now call Joanie I believe McIntyre
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
is that correct good morning from New
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%

Associates and I'm this year's president

of the New Hampshire Association of
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
Realtors um the Realtors would ask that
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
you support
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
HB um 1293 the Realtors recognize New
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's lakes and rivers also
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
protect and enhance real estate values
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
for both residential and commercial use
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
properties on clean well-managed lakes
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
and rivers are more attractive to buyers
 
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
and Property Owners by protecting views
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunities and overall
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
quality of life the Realtors
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
participated in the house house bill
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
1066 legislative commission which which
 
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
reviewed the causes of CYO bacteria
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
blooms and suggested solutions to remedy
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
these issues the resulting report which
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
has been discussed already found that
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
our water bodies are highly susceptible
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
to excessive nutrient loads from storm
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
water runoff hb1 1293 is a respons and
 
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
practicable approach to fix the problem
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
in the most effective way by cutting the
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
nutrient load in storm water runoff
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
Realtors as you probably know are highly
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
protective of property rights and tend
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
to resist overly combersome or expensive
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
mandates We Believe HB 1293 is a fair
 
00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
costeffective approach which will result
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
in meaningful decrease in nutrient
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
loading in our water bodies at a minimal
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
cost to Property Owners real there's
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
hope that you will um will vote a to

just pass it on to representative Davis
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
joerger good morning and you indicated
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
three minutes to speak sounds
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
good good morning uh just wanted to say
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
I do support this bill uh I live on
 
00:55:51.829 --> 00:55:51.839 align:start position:0%
Arlington Pond also and the pond for the
 
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
most part this summer was useless uh it
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
looked looked great we could put around
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
the pond but we couldn't actually go in
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
the water because of the Cal
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
bacteria uh and back in 20122 we did
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
have a bloom also then so it it it's not
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
just this year it's other years that
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
that the problem is occurring so
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and uh fertilizer it it's
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
definitely a problem if you do any
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
research on it so I do agree uh the one
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
comment if possible um I would like to
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
see golf courses also included in the
 
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
bill as to restricting the use of a
 
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
phosphorus Center fertilizer I
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
understand agriculture but a golf course
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
can be a little less green and that's
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
fine with me because golf courses are
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
beautifully green and they put a lot of
 
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
fertilizer down and they can definitely
 
00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
too okay thank you appreciate your
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
testimony this
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.829 align:start position:0%
testimony this
morning

00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay um I would like to now uh invite
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
speak thank you madam chair for letting
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
me speak good morning good morning I
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
also live on Arlington Pond and has
 
00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
already been stated we had very little
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
recreational time on the lake this
 
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
summer um and I'll disagree with my
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
husband it wasn't pretty because for a
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
large part of that we had very ugly neon
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
green in front of our entire property so
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's it affected our quality of life um
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
it also potentially if this continues
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
and um escalates as it has been in the
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
last few years it seems to be getting
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
worse and worse um for over the past few
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
years it's going to affect our property
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
values uh we would have dead fish on our
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
property so it's affecting the the fish
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
in the lake as well as people's use of
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
the lake and I do think that trying to
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
control the phosphorus is one of several
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
ways that we can work on that I am part
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
of a watershed committee that was formed
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
on the lake um we're going to look at an
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
entire Watershed plan but we're trying
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
to educate um work through our
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
association and educate the residents on
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
everything that they can do to try to
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
control what feeds the cyano bacteria
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
and the phosphorus and INF fertilizer is
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
definitely a major contributor to that
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much thank you for
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
your comments any questions for Miss
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you for taking my question
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if someone answered this
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
already do you approximately know how
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
many people um live like like on you
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
know on the lake that have property and
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
then the second question is is there any
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
um kind of Public Access as well to the
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
to the pond there isn't really public a
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
access there are some people that use um
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
some Road access Kids jump jump in and
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
swim from there they put their kayaks in
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
and fish but there are Lori might know
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
how many houses on the
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:33.349 align:start position:0%
how many houses on the
RO

00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
Arlington Pond has at least 300 homes
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
that about it um but I want to preface
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
and I realize this as I'm listening to
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
everyone this is not an issue of small
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
ponds the broads was shut down so I mean
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking parts of Lake wiip pasak
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
were shut down this summer as well um
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
this all started years ago um I believe
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
it was representative rang who is really
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
and she's one of the co-sponsors on this
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
she really brought this to the for the
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
Forefront when her Lake had uh Sino
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
bacteria and they only found that out
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
because two dogs died and someone took
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
the dogs and had autopsies done and came
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
to find out that it was the Cino
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
bacteria that killed them now what they
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
did was they kept thinking oh it's from
 
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
the manure from the agriculture or from
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
the farm of the street and once they did
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
their Lake management plan they found
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
out it was actually from one of the
 
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
holding bins one of the basins that we
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
were talking about that breached um so
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the manure from
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
the Farms where everybody we right away
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
like to try and think of it must be this
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
and it must be that there are so many
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
things that cause cob bacteria um blooms
 
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
but phosphorus clearly as I said in that
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
report that was dated just recently in
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
November of um of 23 um the conclusion
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
was that one of the prim primary focuses
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
should be on the phosphorus um overloads
 
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
in the lake and how it's getting
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
you question if I could just add one one
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
thing sure go ahead to your question in
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
addition to the actual houses on the
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
lake there are Lake Associations and
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are many many houses on the
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
streets just off of the lake and they do
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
have um they have boating access and
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
beach access there are several
 
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.309 align:start position:0%
beach access there are several
associations

01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
associations
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
beaches that people use as
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you very much thank you
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
anything else regarding this bill I
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
wouldd like the blue sheet please uh
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Davis 2011 or zero
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
opposed oh uh so from the online portal
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
we had 201 people in favor of this bill
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
and zero opposed to this bill oh one one
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
neutral one neutral thank you so you
 
01:01:57.359 --> 01:02:01.190 align:start position:0%
neutral one neutral thank you so you
have

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
that and we have four people on our blue
 
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
shet who are in favor of this
 
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.670 align:start position:0%
shet who are in favor of this
bill

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
so um so I think um we would probably
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
like to get um some input from
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture on this bill
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
as well as um Farm
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
Bureau and other than that um I'm going
 
01:02:28.269 --> 01:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
to close out this
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
hearing and give us a few minutes for
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
the clerk to get set up for the next
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:03:08.029 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.279 --> 01:03:40.549 align:start position:0%
 
set

01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
1293 I'm okay I am with that I am going
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
to open up the hearing for HB
 
01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:03.640 align:start position:0%
1294 uh this is relative to prohibiting
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire from
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
enforcing the regulations of the
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
Agency and here to IND introduce the
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
Granger uh thank you madam chair and uh
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh so my name
 
01:04:27.069 --> 01:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
is representative Granger and uh you
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
might be thinking that this is a crazy
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
and so you might be wondering why I'd
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
push a bill that uh nullifies the
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
entirety of the EPA or at least tries to
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
um the reason is actually pretty simple
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
we don't exactly know what part of the
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
EPA is currently attacking our Rochester
 
01:04:50.589 --> 01:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
and Milton uh we know for sure that we
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
have violated something or at least they
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
claim to have VI that the towns and
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
cities have Rochester and Milton have
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
violated some part of what they claim to
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
be but we can't tell you exactly which
 
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
part and we've been working on this for
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
quite some time and getting answers out
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
of the EPA has been incredibly difficult
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
so my constituents have demanded this
 
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
and I normally don't work in the
 
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
environmental side of things but uh when
 
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
constituents demand something you have
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
to do it uh especially when they do it
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
in in mass and they seem to have pretty
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
good reason to back up they what they're
 
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.789 align:start position:0%
good reason to back up they what they're
angry

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
angry
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
about so I'd love to give you a
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the totality of events that
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
have led to this spill but it's not
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
really that simple uh it's very easy to
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
see that the towns are getting attacked
 
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
by the EPA and we're not entire but it's
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's much more difficult to explain
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
exactly why that's the case um
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
so it seems to be related to a snail in
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
the Great
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
Bay um so there is the claim that the
 
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
EPA is making is that Knight nitrogen
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
from from the raced water treatment
 
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
plant in Milton is going into the Salmon
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
Falls River and killing a specific
 
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
species of snail um they they've made
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
the same claim for every community that
 
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
is on that River working from the Great
 
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.349 align:start position:0%
is on that River working from the Great
Bay

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
Bay
 
01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
up uh
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
so the amount of evidence that's
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
available for this claim is seems to be
 
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
very very scant uh accessing it has been
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
very very difficult and the EPA is an
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
organization that notoriously loves to
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
overstep their statutory Authority so
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
from such shaky grounds they demand that
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
Milton a town of 4,500 people either
 
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
build a brand new wastewater treatment
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
plant even though they haven't really
 
01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
proven that we're the source of the
 
01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:47.799 align:start position:0%
nitrogen or build a giant pipe all the
 
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
way from our septic to Rochester for
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
treatment which would require it going
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
through mountains and granite and things
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
like that which obviously we cannot
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
afford uh Rochester already had their
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
hit with this same alleged issue we're
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
not sure that the actual issue is real
 
01:07:08.109 --> 01:07:08.119 align:start position:0%
but uh they claim that uh or they have
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
had issues uh regarding contracts that
 
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
they've been forced to sign by the EPA
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
um which I believe representative Penza
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
will be talking about in more detail um
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
Dover is still suffering from uh issues
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
related to this alleged nitrogen
 
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
increase that is allegedly killing the
 
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.589 align:start position:0%
increase that is allegedly killing the
snail

01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
snail
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
um and that was recently seen in their
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
rainwater tax that if anybody is you
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
know any representatives from Dober
 
01:07:33.269 --> 01:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
would probably be tracking that issue as
 
01:07:35.269 --> 01:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
well uh so you may be wondering why I
 
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
nullify the entirety of the EPA based on
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
this um I'm going to be filing an
 
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
amendment to narrow the focus of the
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh but uh we needed to have
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
something to start with uh the first
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
portion of this bill is the meat and
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
potatoes of it uh but we are still
 
01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what specific parts
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
of the EPA we have to nli in order to
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
solve this problem um because all we can
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
do at the state level is is nullify we
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to change how the
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
EPA does business H so if if you think
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
it's Overkill I don't think so um other
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
people may think though but uh we we're
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're planning to narrow the focus and
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
so the per point right now is to try to
 
01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
figure out what specifically we're going
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
after there's other things that are
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
wrong with the EPA outside of uh just
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
Milton Rochester Dober and every other
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
town on the Salmon Falls Rivers uh rain
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
water and things like that uh they're
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
alleged nitrogen um so the EPA is just
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
notorious for not doing anything right
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
like so you take uh if you might have
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
noticed that there's a lot of uh trucks
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
nowadays are a lot longer and larger
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
than they used to be that's because the
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
EPA has incentivized longer Vehicles
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
because the longer your vehicle is the
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
lower the standards for fuel for uh
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
emissions and so in order to meet those
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
emission standards standards instead of
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
building small light trucks that are
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
very fuel efficient like they used to do
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the '90s they make these massive
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
Behemoth go look at a Ford Ranger and
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's the size of a Ford F250 from
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
1995 that's just an example they also
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
destroyed gas jugs uh if you guys have
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
ever purchased a modern gas jug you
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
might notice that those gas jugs don't
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
actually work you cannot actually use
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
the gas jug to fill a vehicle um so you
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
fill it with gas you put it in and it
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't work just splashes all over the
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
place that's because they have spill
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
resistant uh gas jug now that the EPA
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
has mandated that everybody uses even
 
01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
though the old ones were perfectly fine
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
and worked great and nowadays you can't
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
use a gas jug without Hardware
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
modifications uh you also may have heard
 
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
about the recent Supreme Court ruling in
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
regards to how the EPA was overstepping
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
their statutory Authority when it came
 
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
to defining Wetlands um and that just
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
show shows that they do in fact overstep
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
their statutory Authority um and this is
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
in fact an actual problem that actually
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
exists when it comes to how how uh
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies will interpret the letter
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the law in a way that gives them more
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
power at the expense of uh the average
 
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
citizen so uh what I'm trying to what
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is we need time to
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
actually figure out what specific aspect
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
of the EPA we need to nullify and so for
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
that purpose I would like you guys to
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
please don't itail the bill until we
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
have the amendment actually in front of
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
you um in the meantime yes this is a
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
very very wide Bill uh hopefully it made
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
some noise and got some attention and
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
now we can maybe get some answers to the
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
questions we were asking um and uh we
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
have a SE we have a couple more people
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
who are going to be testifying on this

table and sit in the audience As You Are
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
not eligible then to ask
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
out okay um I'm sorry representative
 
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
sopak kidus go ahead hi yes good morning
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
um it's have you or your group or your
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
constituents worked with our federal
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
delegation uh not directly uh they don't
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
like me because of uh party affiliation
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think they would return my
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
emails i' I've T tried to talk to them
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
about other things I uh they you know
 
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
they have our whole other song and dance
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
that they have to deal with thank you I
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that if so if we did
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
determine exactly what part of the EPA
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
and what part of their statutory
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
Authority they are allows them to go
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
after our town in such a way uh and we
 
01:11:46.629 --> 01:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
asked our federal delegation that that
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
would be great if they wanted to help I
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
to okay repres pres Murray thank you
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair um thank you for taking my
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
question I do have a question um has
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
there been no information or letters
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
from the EPA to any any of your town
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities Watershed agencies
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
notifying of
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
the problem so uh representative Burnham
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
is another uh co-sponsor on this bill
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh due to the short notice
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
she wasn't able to make it here today I
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
believe that she would be able to
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
provide all that she has because she is
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
also a selectman in the town of
 
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
Milton representative
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
Dy uh yes uh thank you madam chair um I
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
have a question and a uh correction I
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
believe the in the uh the um the item
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about regarding
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
the EPA and overstepping their boundary
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
boundaries I believe that came before
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
The Supreme Court and that was sacket
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
versus the EPA Okay so it was the
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of the United States that
 
01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
made um the um
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
determination okay that the EPA was uh
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
overstepping its boundaries in fact
 
01:13:07.719 --> 01:13:09.149 align:start position:0%
overstepping its boundaries in fact
every

01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
environmental um
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
organization uh was not only stunned by
 
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
that um decision um but they're figuring
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
out how they might be able to circumvent
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
it because wetlands are very important
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
to our environment so that's that's the
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
comment I wanted to make um the question
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
I have is um in the fiscal note it says
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
that I believe the dees says that we
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
would be losing about $150 million per
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
year in federal funds my question is is
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
how would you be replacing um that
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
money uh so as I said the amendment is
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh a work in progress and is likely to
 
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
make make the fiscal note uh relatively
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
meaningless thank you representative ger
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair and
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I want
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
to follow up on uh something
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative Duty just uh referred to
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
you you've spoken about a recent Supreme
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
Court ruling about overreach uh by the
 
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
EPA uh I don't know if representative
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
Duty referred to one case are you
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the June 20 2022 ruling by
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court in West Virginia
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
EPA I have sacket versus uh the EPA up
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
but I don't have that one up no okay so
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
West Virginia versus the EPA was also a
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh the Court ruled that EPA had
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
overstepped its bounds but even in that
 
01:14:40.629 --> 01:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
case the the conservative Supreme Court
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
who ruled 6 to3 against the EPA didn't
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
even raise a whisper of the question
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
that somehow the agency was
 
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so my question to you
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
is is your judgment as it is expressed
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
in this bill that the EPA is
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional meant to somehow uh
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
take precedence over the Supreme Court
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
which has not raise the
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the existence of
 
01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:04.709 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the existence of
that

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:06.629 --> 01:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
department I believe that the Supreme
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
Court doesn't uh proactively go out and
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
create cases on their own uh someone
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
else has to create a case and then it
 
01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
has to go up through the judicial
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
process in order to get to them I
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
followup follow up uh but they could
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
have in that case not only uh restricted
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
the rul making of of the EPA but
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
actually ruled on the constitutionality
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
of any actions by the EPA they didn't do
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
that but I'll ask you uh also just as a
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
final followup uh to this question about
 
01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:33.830 align:start position:0%
final followup uh to this question about
the

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
constitutionality uh if you're
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
specifically familiar with familiar with
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
sections two and three of article two of
 
01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.910 align:start position:0%
sections two and three of article two of
the

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution let me pull it
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
up well I I'll just I'll say you you
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
could take a look at it these are the
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
articles in the Constitution which
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
establish the right of the Office of the
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
President to to established executive
 
01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
departments this uh EPA was established
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
by law uh which was signed in by uh
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
President Nixon uh and so executive
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
departments uh the fact that the EPA
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
does not exist within the Constitution
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
does not make it unconstitutional those
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
two sections in the Constitution
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
establish the right of the executive
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
branch to establish executive department
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
under of law uh I would say that if
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
would they then be able to just make any
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
Department that they wish the
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Authority is very limited
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
you are only allowed to make to the
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
federal government is only allowed to do
 
01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
that which is explicitly described in
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and things that pertain
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
to that uh the so I I don't think that
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's relevant in this specific case
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
Congress has given the power to
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
establish uh to pass those laws and it
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
was passed by the president to create an
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
executive branch which is uh how the
 
01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.149 align:start position:0%
executive branch which is uh how the
Constitution

01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
works if that's your opinion that's your
 
01:16:52.199 --> 01:16:54.790 align:start position:0%
works if that's your opinion that's your
opinion

01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
opinion
no

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
no representative NAB thank you madam
 
01:17:02.110 --> 01:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for testifying today um
 
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you have worked with Dees on
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
this at all I mean I respect the fact
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
that your towns have a problem and this
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
has been very stressful for towns that
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
have to upgrade their wastewater
 
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and it is an expense
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's an expense if you're an ms4 permit
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
Town um but it it feels like there are
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
other ways to try and get at this
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
outside of nullifying our relationship
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
with EPA as a state so I just wonder um
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so you worked with thees on this
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
issue at all or gotten answers out of
 
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
them at least I mean I feel like there's
 
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
a there's a communication issue going on
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
here in addition to the financial
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
obligations yes it's right we are having
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
communication issues as well the I
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
believe that Claudine Burnham who was
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not able to be here today
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
has been doing that and that's been
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
something that she's been spearheading
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
as part of her her role as a selectman
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
in town um so I personally have not
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
however it has been getting done or at
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
least uh as best as as possible
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
followup represent na thank you I just
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
this isn't really a question but an
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
offer that I work with the Great Bay
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
National estaran research Reserve quite
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
a bit and Dees on Great Bay issues so if
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
I could be helpful in that role of
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
getting answers for you I'd be happy to
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
help because I I respect that you have a
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
much thank you madam chair um just to be
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
clear listening to your testimony uh
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
you're not trying to nullify the EPA
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
this was just a placeholder Bill until a
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
future Amendment could be filed is that
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
correct uh pretty much yeah thank you
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yes thank you uh you had
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um that there were a number of
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
your constituents that had contacted you
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
and therefore you felt you were forced
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
uh to do something um could you tell me
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
approximately how many of those
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
constituents had contacted
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
you I don't count but it's significant
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
enough that the number is not easily
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
attain AED off hand 50 100 a th000 2,000
 
01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
well there's only 4,500 people in the
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
town of Milton and that's what I'm
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get at so for so are we
 
01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
talking about 50% of the population I
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't think it'd be 50% because I don't
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
think 50% of the population pays enough
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
attention to town meetings to uh it's a
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
significant number okay thank you
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
representative kraton you had a
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
question uh yes Madam chair thank you
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
yeah just in line um with the previous
 
01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
question what about uh the Attorney
 
01:19:29.629 --> 01:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
General have they been involved in this
 
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
I mean clearly a lot of things that
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
would fall into their
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
baileywick have been mentioned in this
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
bill uh I I'm I I don't know if they uh
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
if any of us actually have reached out
 
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general if uh you think
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
that that's an appropriate Avenue then
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
we can if we're talking about
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of an agency and their
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
ability to create laws and rules within
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
new state of New Hampshire that would I
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
think that would be another Avenue oh
 
01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.070 align:start position:0%
think that would be another Avenue oh
thank

01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
you um representative Murray thank you
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
question I'm I'm curious to know whether
 
01:20:07.629 --> 01:20:07.639 align:start position:0%
or not you have explored all of the
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
potential impacts to either this bill
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
version or potential amendments that you
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
plan to bring forward would have on
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms outside of just even
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
General Appropriations but also grant
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
funding applications if um there were
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
some sort of relationship change between
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
how we interact with the EPA um
 
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh I I kind of don't want to go into the
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
weeds of that uh I believe there's
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
probably significant disagreement on
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
what the actual role of taking federal
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
funds should be and whether we should be
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
taking federal funds for X Y or z uh
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
so rather
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
than trying
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
to i' I'd rather just not answer that
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
question I
 
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
guess represent Bixby okay so um just uh
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
thinking about the time here and I think
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
that um it's clear that further
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions about the bill as it's been
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
presented to us so far don't actually
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
that make that much sense it's
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
considering doing a a substantial
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment on it uh but I just wanted to
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're aware that this is
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
an early bill so uh we have to have it
 
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
voted out of committee by um
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
mid-February uh so I was wondering when
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
you expect that you might be able to
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
present us with an amendment that we
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
could consider unfortunately if I do not
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
have uh an amendment by the time this
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill is due out of committee then I'm
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I tried I I I I wish I could give
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
you a a deadline but it it's it's it's
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's Hardo so far and um if
 
01:21:59.709 --> 01:21:59.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately an amendment is not out by
 
01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:01.719 align:start position:0%
the time you're uh you have to vote on
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
this or before it has to get kicked out
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
of committee um I I tried my best but um
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
it is what it is at that point I
 
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully we can avoid that
 
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
whole issue by having the amendment to
 
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
you before
 
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
then thank
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions otherwise
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
we can move on to uh we have four other
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
folks who'd like to speak I have uh
 
01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.390 align:start position:0%
folks who'd like to speak I have uh
representative

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.870 --> 01:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
minutes okay um I'd like to restrict it
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
also we have we're running out of time
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to restrict it to uh three
 
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:49.910 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to restrict it to uh three
minutes

01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.350 --> 01:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
okay so I just want to be clear that
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
um you know when I saw this bill I I I
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
you know I was kind of taken off guard
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't support this bill in this in
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
its current fashion in any way so this
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
this this came up because um you know of
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
course it's gotten a lot of social media
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
attention uh negative you know they say
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
negative a better negative attention is
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
better than no attention um I appreciate
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative Granger for bringing
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
this forward so if you can see what I
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
passed out and uh it was copied and so
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
there's definitely um some people have
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
some copies that you can't even really
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
tell this is where this all started
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
where I got involved and it was from
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
it's now from several constituents so in
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
Rochester during our city council uh
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
this conservation law Foundation type
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
pseudo committee uh presented to the
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
Rochester city council um at the time
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
Senator gray was still sitting on that
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
Council he was floored by this um there
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
was so much feedback basically what's
 
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
happening is um a group of city managers
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
from Dover and Rochester uh and
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth uh decided on pretty much
 
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
this rain tax is what it is and um so
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
just to give you kind of an and there's
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
a big contract here and I'll send the
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
committee everything that they need on
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
this um the good thing is is that this
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
went through Dover first and the Dover
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
City Council um actually rejected it but
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
this is the problem they rejected it and
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
there's another constituent that's going
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
to be talking about this she's the one
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
that got me involved in this and she's
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
from do she's from Dover so the city
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
voted 6 to3 to end the rain tag ta but
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's still a contract that was signed
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
that you can see it from Mr joyle on
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
32621 with the EPA is this contract now
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
void and so the City attorney writes
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
back and
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
says this settlement agreement is still
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
in effect and EPA was not a party to
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
that settlement agreement the mam Group
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
which is the you know it's up here it
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
tells you what the name is it's mam is
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
the abbreviation meets periodically you
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
may find ma'am the ma'am uh website here
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
of interest and then I'll send you that
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
so you guys can have that so it there's
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
basically like an intermunicipal body
 
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
that is that is passing something where
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's taxation without representation
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
these these folks that have huge pieces
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
of property like the person that's going
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
to speak is going to be severely
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
impacted if you have rental property if
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
you have if you just have a lot of land
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to get hit and it's it's
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
crazy if you look at this document um on
 
01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.750 align:start position:0%
crazy if you look at this document um on
page

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
11 that you T there are literally four
 
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
city managers that that decided this um
 
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
I know that the constituents that's
 
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
going to speak to you contacted the
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee it was in the summertime and
 
01:26:25.709 --> 01:26:25.719 align:start position:0%
and um and this has just not had enough
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
visibility at all people should be
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
screaming about this um and I talked to
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
the city council in Rochester after that
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
meeting and um everybody was very
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
blindsided the audience was crazy they
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
they just couldn't even believe what
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
they were hearing so and the City of
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
Rochester is actually paying I haven't
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
received that information yet from my
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
91a um paying someone to be on this
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
Council type committee that is
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
deciding this um this whole agreement uh
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
once I send you this electronically you
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
will see where the tax impact is they
 
01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:07.639 align:start position:0%
give a proposed tax impact which is in
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
here too it's hard to read on here but
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we're at there's
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
there's a huge um overreach at this
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
point and um and and that's why that's
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
why um and I don't know if we can pull
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment together somehow to to make
 
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
this type of stuff stop but um we're
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to do everything possible so thank
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
okay um I would also like to call um
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative vure next you've
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
speak thank you madam chair members of
 
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
the committee good morning um I'm going
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
to present a little a little bit of a
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
different view of this bill my view of
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit narrower than I think
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
what you've heard but I think it's well
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
founded um so what is this bill not
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
first of all this bill is not telling
 
01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
the US Congress that it does not have
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
the authority to make law that's not
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
what this is congressional laws related
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
to environment and agriculture would not
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
be voided by this
 
01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:19.639 align:start position:0%
bill recently as I'm sure you guys have
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
discussed a little bit already uh the
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has made significant cuts
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
to the previously existing doctrine of
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
of Chevron Defence this concept that uh
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
that Congress May delegate its lawmaking
 
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
authorities to executive agencies has
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
seen significant
 
01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
cutbacks and that is the primary focus I
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
see in this
 
01:28:47.229 --> 01:28:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill now in recent years the laws
 
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
carrying both civil and criminal
 
01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
penalties promulgated by by executive
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
agencies has dwarfed those laws that
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
have been passed by Congress and that's
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
part of the rationale that's been shown
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
by scotus in rolling back Chev on
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
Defence I would note that the EPA in
 
01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:08.119 align:start position:0%
particular has an extremely spotty track
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
record from classifying part-year ankle
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
deep streams as navigable waterways and
 
01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
devastating farming activity to the
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophic poisoning of the Animus
 
01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
River in Colorado which was purely due
 
01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
to dereliction and incompetence on the
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
part of this Federal
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
agency now we proposed this and I put my
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
name to this document not because I hate
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
the environment but because I love it
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
and I cherish it enough that I would
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
rather see this in the hands of New
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than in this Federal
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
agency now I'd also note that as far as
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
things I've heard and questions that
 
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
I've heard brought up there's nothing in
 
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
this document nothing in this in this
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that nullifies Congress
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's also nothing that nullifies the
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement capacity of the EPA when it
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
is acting according to laws passed by
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
Congress there's that's just not in here
 
01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere it only addresses Rules
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the EPA outside of laws
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
that were passed by Congress and as such
 
01:30:13.629 --> 01:30:13.639 align:start position:0%
I would disagree with the fiscal note
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
and I see no such reason that there
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
should be any law of finances as a
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
result of this Bill thank you
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
Gera thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative so
 
01:30:30.109 --> 01:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh I understand you know going back to
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
our discussion about recent uh Supreme
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
Court decisions regarding the scope of
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
of the EPA there's room for debate but
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's no question that the Supreme
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
Court has ruled on those when when you
 
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
just made reference to uh actions on the
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
part of the EPA that are outside of the
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
scope of the laws that are created by
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
Congress right that's a function is it
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
not for the for the judicial branch
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
which is exact L actually in in uh West
 
01:30:57.950 --> 01:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
Virginia versus EPA uh the the court has
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
a a piece in which they talk about the
 
01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:01.719 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of a Judicial decision
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
in cases that some people thought maybe
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't appropriate but in any event when
 
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
you're talking about rules that are
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
promulgated outside of the laws written
 
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:10.910 align:start position:0%
promulgated outside of the laws written
by

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
Congress is that not a judicial branch
 
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
issue rather than a legislative branch
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
issue no not at all I I think what
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
you're offering is a doctrine of
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
judicial Supremacy and this country was
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
not set up as a Judicial oligarchy it
 
01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
was set up as a as three co-equal
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
branches that have each other in check
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
and I think when there's an error made
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
and I think originally Chevron Defence
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
was an error we as a federalist system
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
need to offer some push back can I
 
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
follow up you may follow up uh I would
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
just encourage you if you take a look at
 
01:31:47.229 --> 01:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
again U uh West Virginia versus EPA that
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
is not the finding of the Supreme
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
Court okay representative dsy yes thank
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um representative beler
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh I attend a lot of conferences and I
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
attend a lot of webinars uh regarding
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
the environment a couple of things are
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
you aware that we that New Hampshire is
 
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
routinely called the
 
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
Alabama of the Northeast because of our
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
environmental um positions are you aware
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
of the fact that we had passed bills in
 
01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
1995 okay to set in place certain
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
targets to improve the environment and
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
we have not yet met those bills the
 
01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
targets of those bills from
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
1995 are you aware that just this past
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
year we updated um our our I believe it
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
was our climate or our our Dees a solid
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
waste management plan that was due to be
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
updated in
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
2003 so for uh for uh members of this uh
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh the House of Representatives to
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
consider the fact that New Hampshire
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
would do better uh than the EPA on
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
environmental standards uh I think they
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
should look at the record are you aware
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
of that uh U thank you that's there was
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions I'll do my best to
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
address them I think two answers first I
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
I would not be on board with um any sort
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
of negative connotations or slandering
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
of our of our Southern uh fellow
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
citizens in Alabama um as far as New
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and our track record um I'm
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
sure there's always going to be room for
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
improvement but I I would ask the the
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
citizens of Colorado how they feel about
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
the M disaster and the poisoning of that
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
major river that was directly
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
EPA okay representative
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
brog thank you madam chair uh
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative beler are you aware that
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
since 200 18 the EPA spent millions of
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
dollars on ammunition firearms and other
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
military grade equipment and are you
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the EPA being a lethal
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
arm of the federal government so I have
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
I have a a basic understanding I I don't
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
know every point of order Madam chair I
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to stay focused on the
 
01:34:17.189 --> 01:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
construct of the bill yes uh I would
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
agree with that I think we should uh
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
stay with the uh
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
with the within the confines of this
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislation well if if I if I may real
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
quick just offer a supporting um I mean
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
this this bill does regard the
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism of the EPA which
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
is a coercive mechanism that often times
 
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
can but you will be bringing an
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to narrow this bill down as I
 
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
understand I I believe that was offered
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
I won't be bringing that amend myself I
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
was offering my more narrow General
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill as it exists thank
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby you had a
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
question yeah um I'd just like to point
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
out for the committee that our purpose
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
here is to ask questions that illuminate
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the bill and I uh and I
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
it is not this is not the time to offer
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
our own personal opinions about it
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's what we do in work sessions so uh
 
01:35:18.669 --> 01:35:18.679 align:start position:0%
please make sure that the that you're
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
asking questions that are uh really
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
trying to illuminate details of the bill
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
that are not clear from the bill itself
 
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay um
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative kto thank you madam chair
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
01:35:38.350 --> 01:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
my question um as you heard the
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um from representative Granger
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
about the snail um and I'm assuming
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about here I
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
understand um that you're looking at
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
this as more narrowly focused um
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
but do you feel that an amendment uh
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
should be brought forth um addressing
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
the specific issue um and how it affects
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh the Lively um hood of these
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
towns I would be perfectly happy to see
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
an amendment brought forward that
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
clarifies any language that we
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
collectively feel needs to be clarified
 
01:36:14.669 --> 01:36:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh I I would note that my again my my
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill as it exists is a
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
bit narrower and I think that's well
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
founded in the actual language of the
 
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.350 align:start position:0%
founded in the actual language of the
bill

01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um
 
01:36:30.790 --> 01:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative belter I I read um sort
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
of quickly read the past report from
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
Dees and there was a mention of s Salmon
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
Falls in there and and mitigation
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
required for um I don't remember um
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
Milton being mentioned but um do do you
 
01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
think that with the remediation for the
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and for the from this bill that
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Granger mentioned be
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
um part of the P remediation that's
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
required that that the Das has has
 
01:36:57.239 --> 01:36:59.910 align:start position:0%
required that that the Das has has
pointed

01:36:59.910 --> 01:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.189 --> 01:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
out I'm sorry could you restate I'm not
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the question yeah so
 
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Granger mentioned that
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
that um nitrogen was the problem that
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
that the REM remediation was required
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
for that was going to cost Milton a lot
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
of a lot of money in Rochester um and I
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
think that this was also pulled out as
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
as a p um project
 
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
and um would they would those be tied
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
goes I I apologize I I don't see any any
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
direct reference to the nature of the
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
bill if if you want me to answer more
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
generally I I believe those are articles
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
that can and should be um in the hands
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire and I
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
think we can do that as a legislature to
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
make sure these things get done
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
right no I think we need to move on here
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
and I would like to to have uh thank you
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and have
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan come and speak uh
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
you have outlined three minutes we are
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
already over our time so I would like to
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
get through this quickly because we have
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
lunch so I'm representing Timothy Horgan
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
I represent statford County District 10
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
which is the town of Durham which uh
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
directly uh which has uh well several
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
miles of Shoreline in Great Bay so we're
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
actually uh the whole town drains into
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
Great Bay and we do uh we do spend a lot
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
of money on uh Wastewater uh treatment
 
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
and but that's one of our
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as a town and Milton
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
you know maybe 15 miles upstream and
 
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
maybe a town of only 4500 but that is uh
 
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
one of its responsibilities and I think
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
Banning the EPA from the state doesn't
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
really help it meet those
 
01:38:53.709 --> 01:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um we certainly could
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
do a better job with it I was not aware
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
of the issue with um I mean I hear a lot
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
about pollution in Durham my
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
constituents have never uh said anything
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
about uh nitrogen or an endangered
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
species of snail I don't even know what
 
01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
the species of snail is it might have
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
been helpful if we'd got some
 
01:39:14.109 --> 01:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
information about exactly what the
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
species was of snail but
 
01:39:20.430 --> 01:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
um so I uh but certainly certainly my
 
01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
community you know fully supports uh
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
fully supports not polluting Great Bay
 
01:39:28.669 --> 01:39:28.679 align:start position:0%
and that's uh you know water um
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
everything's in interconnected is even
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
um you know the founding father's notice
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
it's mentioned that you know caring for
 
01:39:37.149 --> 01:39:37.159 align:start position:0%
waterways especially navigable waterways
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
of Salmon Falls is explicitly you know
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
part the federal government's powers
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
from the beginning it's even like
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's even some Federalist Papers
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
about the environmental issues this is
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
nothing new so I was mostly reacting
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
just to the bill um the bill as for
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
presented I the hypothetical amendment I
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if nullifying part of the EPA
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
is any better idea or any more
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution than nullifying the whole
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
thing which is what the original Bill
 
01:40:04.629 --> 01:40:04.639 align:start position:0%
said um the frankly I didn't understand
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Amendment the
 
01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
original bill at all I think I even
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
joked that it sounds like it was written
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
by chat GPT but that's um but to get
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
down we don't have the power to
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
unilaterally ban the EPA or any other
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
Federal agency or even to partially ban
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
it from the state and also even if we
 
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
had the power which we don't it's a
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
terrible idea um as I already said you
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
know as I as I said you know water
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
pollution uh is a legitimate problem
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
even if we don't have the EPA even if we
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
suceed of the United States we still
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
have to deal things including nitrogen
 
01:40:38.159 --> 01:40:39.470 align:start position:0%
have to deal things including nitrogen
runoff

01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
runoff
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
um the issue with this snail and I um I
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
mean I know there are endangered species
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
here in here in New Hampshire I'm not
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with any snail in Great Bay but
 
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
I it's plausible there is one um you
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
know it's probably not just about the
 
01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:55.719 align:start position:0%
snail it's about the whole ecosystem so
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
the issues with that snail would be uh
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
they would be sort of a symbol of what's
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
wrong with the uh something that's wrong
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
the entire ecosystem and certainly
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
restricting nitrogen runoff is like a
 
01:41:08.030 --> 01:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate way of of addressing those
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
problems so and the fiscal note has two
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
pages long sign the first person to
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
basically defend the EPA here of it
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
shows many many things that it does for
 
01:41:19.709 --> 01:41:19.719 align:start position:0%
the state that are good for the state to
 
01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:21.159 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge the dep
 
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services likes having them
 
01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:25.639 align:start position:0%
here they don't want them to like they
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to get rid of them and also
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
if we focus on the EPA there's other
 
01:41:31.229 --> 01:41:31.239 align:start position:0%
agencies like for example the Army Corps
 
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
of Engineers for which I used to work
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
many years ago for a few years who also
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over that so you're
 
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
not you're not banning all the uh if you
 
01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:41.719 align:start position:0%
get rid of even you ban the EPA or
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
partially you've still got other
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
agencies you have to deal with so I
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
think um I think this bill's inexpedient
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
to legislate the uh Amendment um I as I
 
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
said it doesn't exist I haven't seen it
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't think I could vote for that
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
either so I I think the best thing to do
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
is um find it inexpedient to legislate
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
or you could try to have an interim
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
study maybe to get a little bit more
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
clarity about what these issues are
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
because I don't um I didn't quite
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
understand the explanation of what the
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
problem was except in so far as Milton
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh may need to build a new wastewater
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
treatment plant which representan can
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
you wrap up please yes so I think I've
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
covered everything so uh I think this
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
bill is not worth pursuing and you
 
01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
should either in expedient the
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
legislator possibly interim study but
 
01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
probably just itl is probably the best
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
thing to do and at least at least now I
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
do understand why I was in this
 
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
committee because I first read it I said
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
this sounds more like the kind of thing
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
they send to state federal or
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration but at least
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
I see why it's here but yes thanks thank
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
you and our last pink card is um for uh
 
01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.870 align:start position:0%
you and our last pink card is um for uh
Julie

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
Julie
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
Porter Welcome to our committee and I
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
hope you can be brief no unfortunately
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
not well we have other bills that
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
understand but I'm a citizen I'm
 
01:43:01.589 --> 01:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
probably the only one in this room that
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
represents a farm okay so I I implore
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
you to listen to me we are listening I I
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
just would like you to I'll make it as
 
01:43:11.589 --> 01:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
brief as I can this could go on for days
 
01:43:14.510 --> 01:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
but here we go several years ago I
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
learned about the city of DOA work to
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
implement a Rain Tax that led me here
 
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
today unfortunately due to the storm and
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
my plow truck breaking down I didn't
 
01:43:25.350 --> 01:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
have any copies to pass out but I will
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
email the information I have because it
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
might answer a lot of questions the Rain
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
Tax or stormw water utility I'm going to
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
expose you to the EPA overreach without
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
cause or proof to strangle hold New
 
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people and natural resources
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
there's not enough time to get into all
 
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
the details today the email that I'll
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
send includes just a few of the links
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
involved in this effort which links
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
includes dozen more links I mean it
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
could go on you could spend years trying
 
01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
to research this
 
01:43:58.830 --> 01:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
stuff I believe you'll find as I did
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's no actual science to back any of
 
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
this up just assumptions my focus is on
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
farming but many other professions
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
people in natural resources are at risk
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
farming big and small has always been
 
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way the lands have
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
flourished with food and livestock to
 
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
feed us through time yet the EPA has
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
only been around for 50 years while
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
farmers are trying to keep New Hampshire
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
natural resources EA comes along and
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
does the opposite UNH extensions spent
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
over a 100 years in developing best
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
management practices for best yields and
 
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
the ecosystem one of those is a buffer
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
zone for Wetlands it's known to filter
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
possible contaminant runoff no one wants
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
dirty water no one wants dirty air no
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
one so why has the government become so
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
blinded by the special interest project
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
they can't see the forest through the
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
trees since when Lodge corporations can
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
permit to dredge and fill Wetlands
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
overnight and the little guy gets the
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
shaft for having large large and perf
 
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
surfaces pole bars and driveways the EPA
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
has become an arm of big government to
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
do the bidding of lobbyists so when it
 
01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
comes to the actual environment they
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
fail the land and the people how someone
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
in DC or even Boston possibly can have a
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
clue what lands and water in New
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire need by sitting in a desk
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
looking at satellite imagery that tells
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
only half the truth of the land they
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
show no bmps or even a homeowner using a
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
rain barrel and overa we just put to
 
01:45:19.149 --> 01:45:19.159 align:start position:0%
rest for now the first in the state Rain
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
Tax or storm water utility
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
this effort was forced upon taxpayers to
 
01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
appease the maam which was mentioned
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
before the EPA and the clf which I mean
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
these these go on forever there's a
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
million groups involved in this so if
 
01:45:34.669 --> 01:45:34.679 align:start position:0%
you want to delve into it I'll send you
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
the links contract dated 321 with Port
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
Smith overa Rochester City basically
 
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
tried to
 
01:45:43.229 --> 01:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
enact a restrictive unjustified burden
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
on property owners and effect to help
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
pay for costs associated by the
 
01:45:51.589 --> 01:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
EPA contract and shortfall in the city
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
budget for sewer duver overa development
 
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
the impact to small homes was minimal
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
but to Farms Apartments businesses and
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofit it was tens of thousands of
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
dollars per year my farm alone was
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
Tax sorry the tax is going to be double
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
tax we're already taxing our square
 
01:46:20.669 --> 01:46:20.679 align:start position:0%
footage and this tax includes imper
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
surfaces even nonprofits weren't exempt
 
01:46:25.390 --> 01:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
in fact the only exemption was State
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
highways it died because it was done
 
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
clandestine no one believed it no one
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
seemed to pay attention until the day
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
before the vote people woke up showed up
 
01:46:36.030 --> 01:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
schooled the city council in ways of
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
notice illegal taxation the mayor and
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
sever city council members agonized and
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
voted six to3 to kill the tax there was
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
no there was so much wrong with this
 
01:46:47.229 --> 01:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
effort it would be a nightmare for
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
property owners and the rest of us
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
several of the items on the epa's list
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
for those SE were one of those items
 
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
there there's hundreds of them was they
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
wanted us to replace our septics Sy I'm
 
01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
on septic they wanted us to replace our
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
septic systems and replace them with
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
nitrogen-free systems yet the the New
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees has not approved a
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
nitrogen fee septic system my property
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
rates over 4,000 TSS which I believe is
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
total surface solubles which is
 
01:47:18.990 --> 01:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and nitrogen while my
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
neighbor who applies p pesticides
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
regularly to their lawn is about 200 so
 
01:47:25.589 --> 01:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
you can see the vast difference mainly
 
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
because I have a large farm a lot of
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
pole buildings this number is each
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
Property Owners impacted the link to all
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
SE Coast towns in each land impact I'll
 
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
send that to you as well overreach the
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
EPA wants the city to pay $20 million
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
for a new wastewater treatment plan and
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%
don't even know if it'll work the
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
efforts the city has done to nearly
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
eliminate nitrates from discharge into
 
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
the rivers is about 90% same with
 
01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.070 align:start position:0%
the rivers is about 90% same with
Rochester

01:47:51.070 --> 01:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
this is according to New Hampshire DS
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to tons of people over there
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
yet the EPA is demanding a $20 million
 
01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
new plant they don't even know if
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
nitrogen is the issue part of the claim
 
01:48:03.629 --> 01:48:03.639 align:start position:0%
comes from the epa's newest pet project
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
nitrogen like CO2 nitrogen is one of the
 
01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
basic elements to Growing food if you're
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
a farmer you know
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
this in 2006 there was a hundred-year
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
flood or Mother's Day flood in the Sea
 
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
Coast I'll have photos that I'll send
 
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
you this massive flood caused the
 
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants all along
 
01:48:21.589 --> 01:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
the river in the SE Coast to overflow
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
effluent into Great Bay you can see that
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
on the chart from the nhdes spike since
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
testing started in 200000 to 2016 the
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
nitrogen levels have plummeted and wred
 
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
themselves that's what happens with a
 
01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
fast moving tidal River according to the
 
01:48:39.709 --> 01:48:39.719 align:start position:0%
EPA it isn't enough yet there have been
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
zero studies to determine what Eel Grass
 
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
I'll get to Eel Grass in a minute to the
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
Bay decline no one study has been done
 
01:48:49.709 --> 01:48:49.719 align:start position:0%
to determine if it is in fact nitrogen
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
or something else entirely or maybe it's
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
the natural natural life cycle of Eel
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
Grass no one seems to know or care so
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
let's call it nitrogen all the
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
environmentalists will be happy wrong
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
this issue is far more compelling I've
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
asked everyone all the
 
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
Departments to the agencies what if
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
nitrogen tanks in the bay okay big SC
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
what if if we go too far with this whole
 
01:49:16.589 --> 01:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
nitrogen thing what if it tanks what are
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
you going to do are you going to they
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
don't they don't have anything in place
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
nothing zero zip NADA to test if it goes
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
too low and they have no fail safe to
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
what to do with it if it does go too low
 
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
and again this the city and the maam are
 
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
actually starting a study to try to find
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
answers as to why and I don't know what
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
about the snail but according to them
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's the Eel
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
Grass I own a farm in do I've had it for
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
30 years I grew up on dairy farms and
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
Lee we maintained a healthy balance with
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
nature we know how the land works and
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
how it efficiently make the land prosper
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
in your Wildlife rural character
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
gentrification small farms were
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
encouraged now Farms are the
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
devil when I found about about the
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
nitrogen I had my property tested
 
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
because again I'm like well I certainly
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to harm my land I don't want
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
to harm the bay I don't want to harm
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
anything so I had my property tested on
 
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
a storm water day off the roof zero
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
excess nitrogen all the way to my my
 
01:50:19.229 --> 01:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
retention pond with 52 houses drain in
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
including my manure pit on and on and on
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
zero excess nitrogen I go all the way to
 
01:50:25.470 --> 01:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
the Bellamy Reservoir which is pouth
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
water supply tested there zero excess
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
nitrogen I don't know what I don't know
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
what they're doing but anyway let's talk
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
about eelgrass according to the
 
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
authorities Eel Grass is declining some
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
of the things listed to the decline are
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
humans changing conditions run off
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Etc so the EPA others go
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
after the wastewater treatment plans but
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
are absolutely sure they are the cause
 
01:50:49.390 --> 01:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
if eone is a factor in the Bay's Health
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
then why are both boat stumping raw
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
sewage in the bay while golf courses of
 
01:50:54.990 --> 01:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
beautiful Lawns exempt why is the ra to
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
front development allowed at all why are
 
01:50:59.709 --> 01:50:59.719 align:start position:0%
The Lawns allowed to add harmful
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
pesticides and live on the
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
bay the folks who on Waterfront boats
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to be treated like the rest
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
of us I guess I don't know why no one
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
speaks up and why I do I deeply care for
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
every spotted wood Blanding turtle on my
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
property the owls the plants the spotted
 
01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
striped salamanders the veral pools
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
which are many that team with life the
 
01:51:22.830 --> 01:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
deer the Moose we are fortunate to have
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
on our land the trees we are the second
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
largest Pine in the county 30 years of
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
being a caretaker and you'll allow some
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
suit in Boston to take this away because
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
basically that kind of money we'll be
 
01:51:37.229 --> 01:51:37.239 align:start position:0%
selling it to development I don't want
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
grandchildren but some suit in Boston's
 
01:51:45.709 --> 01:51:45.719 align:start position:0%
driving this bus I have no
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
idea and and this whole area if this
 
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff goes on and it is is going
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
into all the towns including durm all
 
01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
anyone that's on a river in New
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire basically is going to get some
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
kind of nitrogen thing from the
 
01:52:01.550 --> 01:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
EPA so getting New Hampshire Dees in
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
control without the overhand at EPA is a
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
start maybe we can heal what's left of
 
01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:06.830 align:start position:0%
start maybe we can heal what's left of
our

01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
lands before you know before Farmers
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
have to sell just going to give you a
 
01:52:14.669 --> 01:52:14.679 align:start position:0%
couple timelines I'm almost done um my
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
land was farmed in the 400 years ago and
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
for colonies 1640 New Hampshire was
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
established 1776 UNH 1866 extension 1917
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
now extensions if any of you are farmers
 
01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
know how valuable extension is to us
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
which is another one last point I want
 
01:52:36.589 --> 01:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
to bring up the EPA is
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
1970 so to me there's a big disconnect
 
01:52:42.069 --> 01:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
there they they aren't working with
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
us so when it comes to extension
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to pull nitrogen out of
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
the water we send our so samples to
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
extension every year they tell us to put
 
01:52:52.830 --> 01:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
nitrogen back in so somebody please tell
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
me what is going on I I would really
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
like to know what the EPA what all these
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
people are doing I go to the city I talk
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
to them their hands are tied the city of
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
Dober is paying millions of dollars or
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
whatever on studies for the EPA to make
 
01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.350 align:start position:0%
whatever on studies for the EPA to make
them

01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
happy the more I get into this the more
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
my head hurts and all I want to to is do
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
my farm and and this kind of stuff comes
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
up and I'm not going to be able to do it
 
01:53:19.149 --> 01:53:19.159 align:start position:0%
anymore neither are there the other
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
Farmers that don't even know about this
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
CA has only run around for 50 years
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
where farming been here for hundreds the
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
land I occupied steuart is Native
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
American land we need better studies
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
before jumping into possible
 
01:53:36.069 --> 01:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
irreversible programs have our own New
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees and control of New
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire natural resources is a start
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
again I'm not sitting here telling you
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm against the environment it's
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
the opposite and I do think that there's
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
a problem and a disconnect with those
 
01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
suits in Boston telling us people in New
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about my flood plane I'm sorry
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
but it's it's bad and we fought this and
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
no one would listen and that's why I'm
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
here today because I don't know if
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to listen to me or not but
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you a whole lot of Wildlife
 
01:54:07.470 --> 01:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
and whatever in my property is going to
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
go because I can't afford it I can't
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
afford it anymore Dober is like one of
 
01:54:13.629 --> 01:54:13.639 align:start position:0%
the most expensive towns and the money
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
they've spent on this EPA juggling thing
 
01:54:19.709 --> 01:54:19.719 align:start position:0%
with with SE sep sewers and Wastewater
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and on and on and
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
Rochester is dealing with the same
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
thing I really don't know so thank you I
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time thank you any
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%

01:54:41.229 --> 01:54:41.239 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you um uh Madam is your
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
property uh in current use yes so you're
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
Al you're already getting a reduced tax
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
rate in order for you to G your property
 
01:54:58.589 --> 01:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes okay thank you
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
what's that got to do I'd like to know
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
what that has to do with it no it's not
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
your every Farm in New Hampshire's on
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
current use honey every one it's not
 
01:55:08.870 --> 01:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
your perview to ask questions I can't
 
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
ask questions no we are asking questions
 
01:55:13.229 --> 01:55:13.239 align:start position:0%
from your test excuse me I never done
 
01:55:15.229 --> 01:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
this before I want to be home on my farm
 
01:55:17.229 --> 01:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
I don't want no worries representative
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
kulan you had a question oh yeah first
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
of all I'd like to you know say I think
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
that you've incurred a great Injustice
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
in your way over tax and it sounds like
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
you in your town and everyone else is
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
being bullied by the EPA and I think it
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like you think that maybe we
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
might consider waiting for an amendment
 
01:55:40.830 --> 01:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
to fix and overhaul this bill to help
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
people like you and Farmers because
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we're supposed to be doing
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
on this committee is caring about
 
01:55:49.950 --> 01:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
farmers and you sound like you are one
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
so yeah I am one awesome thank you
 
01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
chair and and maybe this is a question
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
for the original sponsor or or or
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
yourself I don't I don't know but
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
forgive me if you can't answer it then
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
somebody else can fine um I I was
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
looking through some of the other
 
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
information that was provided to us and
 
01:56:11.229 --> 01:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
it looks like there were according to a
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
letter that was included in some of the
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
testimony there are 13 New Hampshire
 
01:56:17.069 --> 01:56:17.079 align:start position:0%
Wastewater dischargers that were being
 
01:56:19.149 --> 01:56:19.159 align:start position:0%
considered from the US Environmental
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
Protection agency and it sounds to me
 
01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
like based on your information and some
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
of the others that we don't really have
 
01:56:29.069 --> 01:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
a full complement of information here no
 
01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
and and that's my point to every
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
everyone that even even to the city that
 
01:56:35.350 --> 01:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
there's not enough study done to know
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
exactly why eelgrass is dying is it is
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
it a natural cycle is it something else
 
01:56:45.069 --> 01:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
entirely they don't know they absolutely
 
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
you cannot I've looked through every
 
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
single document after every single
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
person and not one one person can tell
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
me why what's going on in the bay and
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
why so they just put a name on it it's
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
nitrogen it's nitrogen and C then
 
01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
cascaded a bunch of other stuff but
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
there there are groups out there and and
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
I guess do told me because I met with
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
them last week the City attorney said
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
that they I think at the mam group or
 
01:57:11.229 --> 01:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the groups is going to
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
actually begin studying why because we
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
you know Dober can't incur and they
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't don't even know if it's going to
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
work they don't even know of these
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
things that the EPA is setting up for us
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
are going to work so they're working
 
01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
closely with New Hampshire Dees and you
 
01:57:27.069 --> 01:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
know I've talked to them at length I
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
don't agree with everything but some of
 
01:57:32.109 --> 01:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
the I think it's better
 
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
local I don't know that your question
 
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
but representative ger thank you madam

thank you uh do you know uh it would
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
seem to me that in addition to D Dees
 
01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General's office might
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
be a place to go uh to see you know what
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
protections might be uh made available
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
from the state uh so do you know uh what
 
01:58:06.430 --> 01:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
Outreach has been done to the attorney

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
blue sheet um I've also been informed
 
01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
that the uh online um comments on this
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
for were in support of this bill and 44
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
were in opposition of this
 
01:59:24.639 --> 01:59:26.350 align:start position:0%
were in opposition of this
bill

01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:59:30.069 --> 01:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
four and 44 were in
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
opposition online yep in the blue sheet
 
01:59:36.990 --> 01:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
nobody has written anything on this so
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close this
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
hearing for hb1
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
1294 and we are running late um this is
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be our lunchtime but
 
01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get through this next
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
one very quickly so I invite um
 
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Maguire to come and
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
1626 thank you very much Madam chair
 
02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:00.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Maguire I represent the
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
town of Epsom this year I happen to be
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
the chair of the joint committee on
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds um this is a committee
 
02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
which um reviews all the dedicated funds
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
on a five-year cycle and um makes
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations of what what's to be
 
02:00:23.310 --> 02:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
done with those funds and this year we
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
we did a fifth of the funds um which
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
included the Department of Agriculture
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
and this bill House Bill 1626 is the
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
result of the committee's work and it's
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's not exactly technical changes but
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's the next best thing you know
 
02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of Bill that that
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
frequently just gets passed on consent
 
02:00:45.239 --> 02:00:46.189 align:start position:0%
frequently just gets passed on consent
with

02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
no not much changes the biggest thing in
 
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
the bill um related to the Department of
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
Agriculture is the uh the beginning two
 
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
sections that have to do with the dog
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
license fees so currently
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
$2.50 of the dog license fees goes to
 
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture for um uh
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
$2 for the um spay and neuter program
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
and 50 cents for the veterinary
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
diagnostic laboratory and what we
 
02:01:19.149 --> 02:01:19.159 align:start position:0%
noticed with these two particular funds
 
02:01:22.270 --> 02:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
is one was growing so so they weren't
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
using all the money for that one the
 
02:01:26.669 --> 02:01:26.679 align:start position:0%
other one was shrinking so it needed a
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
little more money and the department
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
asks us to change it change the ratio to
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
$1.75 for the spay and neuter and 75
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
cents for the veterinary diagnostic
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
laboratory that's the kind of stuff this
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is all about so I'm happy to
 
02:01:45.790 --> 02:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
answer questions I brought one copy of
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
our um our report for your for your
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
clerk um but I can get other copies if
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
you if you really want them thank you
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes uh thank you
 
02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so I uh just
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
talked with representative Aly last
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
night who uh was did not really want to
 
02:02:11.069 --> 02:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
come in to testify for two minutes today
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
and I understand uh so uh she gave me to
 
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
understand that uh there are two portion
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
essentially two aspects of this bill one
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
has to do with the repealing of a lot of
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds the other has to do with
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
the dog license fees and she indicated
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
that um that the dog license fee was the
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
only part that really was connected to
 
02:02:35.830 --> 02:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
what we're doing on this committee
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
because the other is pretty much a ways
 
02:02:40.510 --> 02:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
and means issue uh so is is that correct
 
02:02:47.790 --> 02:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay uh so um essentially uh What uh
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is asking us to determine is
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
whether it makes sense to uh make give
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
the Diagnostic lab a little bit more
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
money and the spay and neuter fund which
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
is because it's so effective not needed
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
as much anymore a little bit less money
 
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
is that correct okay y sounds good to me
 
02:03:10.270 --> 02:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
and you could read the dedicated funds
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
report which shows you the balances and
 
02:03:14.669 --> 02:03:14.679 align:start position:0%
how they're changing over the years all
 
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
that stuff thank you or not yeah but
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we did so
 
02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:20.950 align:start position:0%
that's what we did so
all

02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:03:24.189 --> 02:03:24.199 align:start position:0%
right um representative NAB thank you
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for coming in
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
today um I it might be outside of our
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
purview but I just wonder if you could
 
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
speak to part two number three what's
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
changing there with the hunting fishing
 
02:03:36.069 --> 02:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
and trapping nothing's changing it says
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
repealed and okay that's previous unless
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's a highlighted I don't see
 
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
anything highlighted that would address
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
a repeal in that section or
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
we it says it's repealed and react I
 
02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
didn't know if something was changing
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
there or not yeah this is a case where
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
um there was some dedicated F some
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
something going into a dedicated fund um
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
which I guess was um sort of unused and
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
and the fish and game department just
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
wanted it in their J in their their
 
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
normal fund right so they you know that
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what's going on there all
 
02:04:16.030 --> 02:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get that okay repres I just
 
02:04:26.910 --> 02:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
have a comment which is I had been
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
considering executing this now exe
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
executing this today because it's just
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
so straightforward but I think that
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
given the time we should just put it on
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
the list for our other execs in a couple
 
02:04:43.069 --> 02:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
of weeks no problem thank you uh I also
 
02:04:44.669 --> 02:04:44.679 align:start position:0%
have thank you for your
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Maguire uh I
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
have uh one another person who asked for
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
two minutes to speak natch gra from nhma
 
02:04:55.950 --> 02:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
welcome to environment
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
agriculture thank you madam chair n gra
 
02:05:01.549 --> 02:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
for the municipal Association um as
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire uh noted this is
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
a very there are a lot of parts to this
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
bill um the only part that we are really
 
02:05:11.229 --> 02:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
concerned about is the uh apportionment
 
02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
of the fees the dog licensing fees that
 
02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
are kept by the municipality versus uh
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
that go to the state assuming that I
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
read this
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
correctly um although someone should
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
certainly check my math um
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
the there would be a decrease in the
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
total dog registration fee of of dog
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
owners over 65 by a quarter so it go
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
from $2 to
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
.75 and there would be an increase in
 
02:05:42.430 --> 02:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
the amount of the going to the
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
veterinary diagnostic Library by a
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
quarter 50 or 75 cents instead of 50 and
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's not paid by those over 75 uh over
 
02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
65 according to what I believe I
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
understand how this is a portioned um so
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
I went back and looked at uh 2023 is HB
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
585 um the fiscal note for that that was
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
F out by the Department of Agriculture
 
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
indicating they get uh $2 per license um
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
and approximately $400,000 per year from
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
that total um which leaves me to believe
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
there are about 200,000 registered dogs
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um because there was no
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
increase in the amount of the uh overall
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
fee by a quarter um and there was a
 
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
decrease by those over 65 by a quarter
 
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
um I estimated that quarter would cost
 
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
about $50,000 per year um that's about
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
$50,000 per year that would not be kept
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the local level so it' be a a
 
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
decrease local revenues by $50,000 a
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
year across the entire State I recognize
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
that overall in the scheme of things
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
that isn't very much but we do have a a
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
policy to oppose uh decreases in Revenue
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
um that would negatively impact
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because that would have to be
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
made up in some way which is probably
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
local property
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
taxes representative Bixby okay so
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
um the I think that the issue is really
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
stem from uh the a change in the revenue
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
intended for towns I think that it it
 
02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
has to do with the way that the UN
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
existing underlying law is is written
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
which is uh the when when the fees for
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
the DI Diagnostic lab were put in that
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
went to the Diagnostic lab were put in
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
it was done in a sort of clumsy way but
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
I think that um that in fact the changes
 
02:07:50.910 --> 02:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
to the amounts going in and out uh are
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
really pretty are really a wash uh and
 
02:07:56.189 --> 02:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
it just has to do with the way and and
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
what the the the changes don't uh have
 
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
to do with the actual amount going to
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
the towns and or um the towns still
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
retain the same amount of money that
 
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
they would
 
02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
already like I said that's our only
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
concern and someone should double check
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
my math on that okay and and if you want
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
to touch base with me I can go over that
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
section law with you and and we can like
 
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
sort out where why it's confusing it's
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
quite it's quite complex as you know
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
thanks thank
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%

02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
receive a communication from Dr Steven
 
02:08:38.430 --> 02:08:38.440 align:start position:0%

Jasper uh and also um the report put out
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
by Ways and Means give a compelling
 
03:04:57.710 --> 03:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
reason for us to pass this bill and uh I
 
03:05:00.990 --> 03:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
would like to PLL the committee and see
 
03:05:04.030 --> 03:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
if it would be okay with you to execute
 
03:05:06.950 --> 03:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I would say that I support uh I
 
03:05:09.469 --> 03:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
would support that as well so okay
 
03:05:12.269 --> 03:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh representative
 
03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
smart hi the only thing that I I would
 
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
see I would I would support that Bell
 
03:05:20.110 --> 03:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I question is the
 
03:05:23.550 --> 03:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
wording Companion Animal just because we
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
have so many service animals and
 
03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:27.910 align:start position:0%
have so many service animals and
companion

03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
companion
 
03:05:30.910 --> 03:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
animals um that it
 
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
is it's it's just talking about people's
 
03:05:36.590 --> 03:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
pets not companion animals so people
 
03:05:38.429 --> 03:05:38.439 align:start position:0%
bring their dogs into the grocery store
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
because it's my companion animal and I
 
03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
need it for emotional sec security or
 
03:05:47.070 --> 03:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
whatever um well this is this is how
 
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
statute is already written okay we are
 
03:05:52.950 --> 03:05:52.960 align:start position:0%

60% of the Senate is I guess that's 15
 
03:09:03.469 --> 03:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
and then need two-thirds of the people
 
03:09:06.389 --> 03:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
of the general election so it's um
 
03:09:09.309 --> 03:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
anyway so it's uh so what it's it would
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
it would add article
 
03:09:12.950 --> 03:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
83a which will be placed right after
 
03:09:16.830 --> 03:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
article 8 83 which 83 is a rather long
 
03:09:18.670 --> 03:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
article that's in a section entitled
 
03:09:19.870 --> 03:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
part two form of government
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
encouragement of literature trades Etc
 
03:09:25.309 --> 03:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
anyway so what it says is the people of
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
this state shall maintain and improve a
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
clean and healthful environment in New
 
03:09:30.750 --> 03:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for present and future
 
03:09:32.830 --> 03:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
Generations the legislature and
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
magistrates shall provide adequate
 
03:09:36.670 --> 03:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
remedies for the protection of the
 
03:09:38.429 --> 03:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
environmental life support system and
 
03:09:40.630 --> 03:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
provide adequate remedies to prevent
 
03:09:42.510 --> 03:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable depletion and degradation
 
03:09:46.670 --> 03:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
of natural resources and um this was uh
 
03:09:48.910 --> 03:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
based on article 9 section one of the
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
Montana Constitution but with the style
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
rewarded the match the style of the New
 
03:09:55.229 --> 03:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution
 
03:09:57.229 --> 03:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
um we here in New Hampshire we're very
 
03:09:58.429 --> 03:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
proud of the fact we have one of the
 
03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
oldest state constitutions um Montana
 
03:10:02.630 --> 03:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
actually has one of the youngest ones it
 
03:10:05.830 --> 03:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
was adopted in 1973 so it was written in
 
03:10:07.990 --> 03:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
the early 1970s about the same time when
 
03:10:09.750 --> 03:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Agency was
 
03:10:11.469 --> 03:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
founded and
 
03:10:13.870 --> 03:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
03:10:18.229 --> 03:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
and um so the reason and the um and
 
03:10:19.630 --> 03:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
actually I was inspired to introduce
 
03:10:21.030 --> 03:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
this after reading these new stories
 
03:10:22.950 --> 03:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
about a landmark court case in Montana
 
03:10:24.950 --> 03:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
which was Ricky held at all versus the
 
03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
state of Montana at all and I actually
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a copy of it here I thought of pry
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
of copies for everyone but it's 103
 
03:10:35.469 --> 03:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
pages long I mean it's makes fairly it's
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
actually makes fairly good reading but I
 
03:10:38.229 --> 03:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure the one that dumped that
 
03:10:40.429 --> 03:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
much paper on everyone but uh I I'll
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
give a copy to the clerk and I certainly
 
03:10:43.429 --> 03:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
raise have copies printed up if people
 
03:10:44.870 --> 03:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
want to look at it or you can look it up
 
03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
for yourself so a diverse group of young
 
03:10:49.790 --> 03:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
montanans sued their state government
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
for tailing failing to take adequate
 
03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
action against global warming um they
 
03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
were challenging the uh they're
 
03:10:59.150 --> 03:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
challenging the constitutionality of the
 
03:11:01.150 --> 03:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
state's environmental energy laws which
 
03:11:03.309 --> 03:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
severely limited the state's ability to
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
mitigate the environmental damage caused
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
by fossil fuels you so Montana here like
 
03:11:10.349 --> 03:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the people are sometimes
 
03:11:12.150 --> 03:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
pulled the resident State sometime
 
03:11:13.590 --> 03:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
pulled in multiple directions on the one
 
03:11:16.030 --> 03:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
hand you know it's it's a very beautiful
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
state with a small population like ours
 
03:11:19.870 --> 03:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
also like a very large area like ours
 
03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
but it also has a large fossil fuel
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
industry so you know and
 
03:11:28.429 --> 03:11:28.439 align:start position:0%
um and so the uh the plist were uh
 
03:11:30.070 --> 03:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
talking about how that had negatively
 
03:11:32.070 --> 03:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
impacted their life so they had a very
 
03:11:34.229 --> 03:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
they had uh young people aged from about
 
03:11:38.510 --> 03:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
six to 21 from all walks of life one of
 
03:11:41.349 --> 03:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
the um hell versus Montana PL actually
 
03:11:42.550 --> 03:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
has a connection to Hampshire and
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
actually to my my community so woman
 
03:11:48.670 --> 03:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
named Georgiana Fisher is now um 21 she
 
03:11:50.910 --> 03:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
was I guess 17 when the law she was
 
03:11:53.190 --> 03:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
first filed she happened to be a uh
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
Elite Nordic Skier and she's now a
 
03:11:57.429 --> 03:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
scholar Athlete on unh's ski team and in
 
03:12:00.590 --> 03:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
fact one of her uh one of her grievances
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
about the existing law was the fact that
 
03:12:04.349 --> 03:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
uh her trainings become difficult
 
03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
because the snow pack in
 
03:12:09.550 --> 03:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
Montana um doesn't start forming now
 
03:12:11.790 --> 03:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
until January it used to start forming
 
03:12:13.630 --> 03:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
in November so that cuts the amount of
 
03:12:16.630 --> 03:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
like live training Nordic CrossCountry
 
03:12:19.510 --> 03:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
skiers can have on on trails and that's
 
03:12:21.790 --> 03:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
actually um I don't cross country ski
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
anymore but certainly we all noticed
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
there wasn't any snow on the ground
 
03:12:28.110 --> 03:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
until uh till till yesterday so which is
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
not how it used to be so um I know I
 
03:12:34.830 --> 03:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
know this is a state 2,500 miles to so
 
03:12:36.229 --> 03:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
to the west of New Hampshire but global
 
03:12:38.110 --> 03:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
warming is a problem in all 50 states
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
and you know we we he we've had bills
 
03:12:42.229 --> 03:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that would uh try
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
to restore restrict our own State
 
03:12:45.070 --> 03:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
government's ability to deal with the
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
consequences of global warming like we
 
03:12:50.190 --> 03:12:50.200 align:start position:0%
often we' buil I've seen bills that go
 
03:12:52.110 --> 03:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
both ways about for example since I live
 
03:12:54.269 --> 03:12:54.279 align:start position:0%
in the sea Coast what to do about uh the
 
03:12:57.269 --> 03:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
problem the problem of uh the problem of
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know rising sea levels
 
03:13:03.389 --> 03:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
so and uh so anyway our New Hampshire
 
03:13:03.399 --> 03:13:04.190 align:start position:0%
so and uh so anyway our New Hampshire
state

03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:13:06.910 --> 03:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
constitution doesn't have an explicit
 
03:13:08.910 --> 03:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
protections for for the environment
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
although I mean it's it's it's implicit
 
03:13:14.630 --> 03:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and in fact um we've generally done a
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
good job over the past 250 years of of
 
03:13:18.670 --> 03:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining a clean and healthful
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
environment and uh environmental laws
 
03:13:24.190 --> 03:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
are I think they're I think they're
 
03:13:25.510 --> 03:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
pretty strong we did hear some
 
03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier about how they could
 
03:13:29.349 --> 03:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
be made stronger but they're you know we
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
we take the environment seriously but I
 
03:13:33.510 --> 03:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
think this will uh help us make it
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
easier for us to take the environment
 
03:13:36.990 --> 03:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
seriously by putting these explicit
 
03:13:39.550 --> 03:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
Protections in the State Constitution
 
03:13:42.070 --> 03:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I um that's why I hope
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
the committee will will uh recommend
 
03:13:47.070 --> 03:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
this bill ought to pass and um hopefully
 
03:13:50.190 --> 03:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
the hopefully down the road the uh the
 
03:13:51.870 --> 03:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
Full House and the Senate and the people
 
03:13:53.510 --> 03:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire will vote
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
by a sufficient super majority to pass
 
03:13:59.590 --> 03:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
it so that's um that's it I do have a as
 
03:14:01.750 --> 03:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
I said I do have a copy of the uh of the
 
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
court of the uh of the uh Court uh the
 
03:14:07.870 --> 03:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
court order from from Montana it's in
 
03:14:10.269 --> 03:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
the uh what they call the district court
 
03:14:12.750 --> 03:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
for Lewis and Clark County which is the
 
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
county where the state capital of helon
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
is it's actually the court is actually
 
03:14:18.550 --> 03:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
roughly equivalent to our Superior Court
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
but it's a it makes for interesting
 
03:14:23.070 --> 03:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
reading but um anyway so thank you very
 
03:14:24.150 --> 03:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair thank you to the
 
03:14:25.710 --> 03:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
committee and if you have any questions
 
03:14:28.469 --> 03:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
I can try to answer them thanks thank
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
you any questions from our
 
03:14:36.349 --> 03:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
committee I do have a question thank um
 
03:14:39.550 --> 03:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
the term clean and helpful environment
 
03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
means a lot of things a lot of different
 
03:14:43.590 --> 03:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
things to a lot lot of different people
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's fine so
 
03:14:51.429 --> 03:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
um how would that be any kind
 
03:14:56.269 --> 03:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:56.279 --> 03:14:57.790 align:start position:0%
 
definite

03:14:57.790 --> 03:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
definite
 
03:15:01.150 --> 03:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
language to be added to the Constitution
 
03:15:03.229 --> 03:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
well it's I mean it's very general
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
language we've added a general language
 
03:15:05.950 --> 03:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
to the Constitution before it's
 
03:15:08.469 --> 03:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
certainly more General than say the one
 
03:15:09.950 --> 03:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
about the right to privacy which we
 
03:15:11.790 --> 03:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
passed a couple of years ago so I mean I
 
03:15:14.590 --> 03:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
think I think it's broad I mean my mind
 
03:15:17.710 --> 03:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
it's clear so that's uh I guess that's
 
03:15:20.070 --> 03:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
basically basically uh basically my
 
03:15:22.030 --> 03:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
answer certainly I don't think anybody
 
03:15:25.349 --> 03:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
wants a dirty or unhealthy environment
 
03:15:29.510 --> 03:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
no yeah as as probably uh as we probably
 
03:15:31.389 --> 03:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
saw from the debate this morning we had
 
03:15:31.399 --> 03:15:32.790 align:start position:0%
saw from the debate this morning we had
for

03:15:32.790 --> 03:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:15:36.670 --> 03:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
example uh representative ger yeah thank
 
03:15:37.750 --> 03:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you
 
03:15:39.189 --> 03:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan for taking my
 
03:15:42.110 --> 03:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
question so my question has to do with
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
how you see what you see the effect of
 
03:15:48.070 --> 03:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment being in Practical terms
 
03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that comes to my
 
03:15:51.590 --> 03:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
mind is a possibility I'm wondering uh
 
03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
what what you think about this uh is for
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
example with the Department of
 
03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
Environmental study uh Services pardon
 
03:15:59.710 --> 03:15:59.720 align:start position:0%
me uh a lot of states have Departments
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Protection yeah uh who
 
03:16:05.750 --> 03:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
have a mission that is explicitly to
 
03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
protect the environment uh the words
 
03:16:10.590 --> 03:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
protection and and prevent both appear
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
here in your Amendment so with an
 
03:16:14.910 --> 03:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
amendment like this would one of the
 
03:16:19.030 --> 03:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
effects be to D provide direction for
 
03:16:21.469 --> 03:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
state agencies right so that this
 
03:16:23.309 --> 03:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
becomes Central to their mission and
 
03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
again I think about Environmental
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
Protection as opposed to Environmental
 
03:16:28.630 --> 03:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
Services which is very often simply a
 
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
permitting agency yeah sure yes so I
 
03:16:32.910 --> 03:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
think it would help clarify the mission
 
03:16:35.349 --> 03:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
I mean they the dees doesn't have to
 
03:16:37.150 --> 03:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
change its name if it doesn't want to
 
03:16:38.510 --> 03:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
although we've changed some State
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
Department agencies since then but yes
 
03:16:43.429 --> 03:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
that would I think help Focus their it
 
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
would help make their mission a little
 
03:16:46.229 --> 03:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
bit more explicit it's a mission which
 
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
they've already I mean they I think they
 
03:16:49.389 --> 03:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
already are committed to Environmental
 
03:16:51.389 --> 03:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
Protection but this would uh just
 
03:16:54.550 --> 03:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
clarify it and back them up I think so
 
03:16:57.070 --> 03:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you sure
 
03:17:01.710 --> 03:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah um I'm a little bit
 
03:17:05.309 --> 03:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
um concerned about the language uh shall
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
provide adequate remedies for the
 
03:17:09.189 --> 03:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
protection of environmental life support
 
03:17:11.429 --> 03:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
system and prod provide adequate
 
03:17:13.150 --> 03:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
remedies for
 
03:17:16.150 --> 03:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh to prevent unreasonable depletion of
 
03:17:20.349 --> 03:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
and degradation of natural resources and
 
03:17:24.030 --> 03:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
the um remedies implies that there is
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
already some sort of
 
03:17:29.429 --> 03:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
damage and it is creating a baseline
 
03:17:31.309 --> 03:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
assumpt it would be creating a baseline
 
03:17:32.950 --> 03:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
assumption in the Constitution that
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's damage and I'm not sure that
 
03:17:38.710 --> 03:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
that is really what we want to be doing
 
03:17:42.309 --> 03:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
oh um well it's up you're um the
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee is the committee uh it's it's
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
your bill now you are free to amend it
 
03:17:50.910 --> 03:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
and um I I uh I think you're I think
 
03:17:52.670 --> 03:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
your your point your your point may be
 
03:17:54.269 --> 03:17:54.279 align:start position:0%
well taken I mean certainly in fact
 
03:17:56.349 --> 03:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
there already has been a lot of damage
 
03:17:58.269 --> 03:17:58.279 align:start position:0%
to the environment so the you know
 
03:18:00.229 --> 03:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
whether we want I mean regardless of
 
03:18:01.710 --> 03:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
whether we have the presumption in there
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
the damage does exist so if if U I
 
03:18:07.710 --> 03:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
basically basically took the existing
 
03:18:09.910 --> 03:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
wording from from uh from this state
 
03:18:13.150 --> 03:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
which is uh you know
 
03:18:15.550 --> 03:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
been there for been there for 50 years
 
03:18:16.950 --> 03:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
and worked pretty well there you know
 
03:18:18.910 --> 03:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
there are uh there probably are other
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
ways you can word it if you want to so
 
03:18:22.590 --> 03:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
it's up it's up to the committee to do
 
03:18:26.309 --> 03:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
that so follow up sure follow so so the
 
03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
the wording uh that wording and that in
 
03:18:30.750 --> 03:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
that sentence is pretty much verbatim
 
03:18:33.389 --> 03:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
from the Montana Constitution yeah
 
03:18:36.229 --> 03:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much i i u i translated into the
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh I mean to the style of our
 
03:18:40.510 --> 03:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and Me Myself and the
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
drafters but uh we pretty much which
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
echoed that provision of the uh
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution they did put a lot more
 
03:18:48.710 --> 03:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
environmental uh things into their
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
constitution probably just because they
 
03:18:53.349 --> 03:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
were writing it in the early 1970s the
 
03:18:56.110 --> 03:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
same era when the the EPA was introduced
 
03:18:58.510 --> 03:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
when there's a lot of people viewed the
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
environmental Shields differently they
 
03:19:00.910 --> 03:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
did in
 
03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
1776 when or I guess it was 1783 but
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
when we
 
03:19:09.510 --> 03:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
were drafting our constitution so okay
 
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you but certainly free to
 
03:19:15.550 --> 03:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
certainly fre re reord it so that's uh I
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
understand that's your right and
 
03:19:19.349 --> 03:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
probably very well may improve the build
 
03:19:21.189 --> 03:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
so I'll wait and see what what you come
 
03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you for presenting this
 
03:19:29.950 --> 03:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
representative hgan I appreciate your
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
testimony the I'm just going to drill a
 
03:19:34.189 --> 03:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
little bit down on represent on
 
03:19:36.750 --> 03:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's question I what
 
03:19:39.870 --> 03:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
is your understanding of the definition
 
03:19:42.469 --> 03:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
of the word remedies does that that does
 
03:19:45.070 --> 03:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
that mean that the state then pays for
 
03:19:46.510 --> 03:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
anything that's perceived as an
 
03:19:46.520 --> 03:19:48.030 align:start position:0%
anything that's perceived as an
environmental

03:19:48.030 --> 03:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
03:19:50.990 --> 03:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
degradation what how do you how do you
 
03:19:53.670 --> 03:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
see that word what what does that
 
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
mean similar to what I believe we see
 
03:19:57.389 --> 03:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
else in the Constitution about the
 
03:19:59.389 --> 03:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
redress of grievances so see when
 
03:20:01.790 --> 03:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
something's wrong it's the government's
 
03:20:03.269 --> 03:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
job to fix it it doesn't mean they
 
03:20:05.469 --> 03:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to pay for every Remedy
 
03:20:07.510 --> 03:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
or do everything that people ask but
 
03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
like we are
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
um both in the legislative branch and
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
the other two co-equal branches uh
 
03:20:16.510 --> 03:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
required to look out for the interests
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the people and including the uh
 
03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
including the people's interest in a uh
 
03:20:23.389 --> 03:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
clean and healthful uh environment so
 
03:20:25.510 --> 03:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh mean somewhat the same thing as
 
03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
like uh you know the regress of
 
03:20:28.510 --> 03:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
grievances that appears elsewhere in the
 
03:20:28.520 --> 03:20:32.349 align:start position:0%
grievances that appears elsewhere in the
Constitution

03:20:32.349 --> 03:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:35.790 --> 03:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
so anyone represent ger thank you madam
 
03:20:37.950 --> 03:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you again uh representative
 
03:20:39.710 --> 03:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
Oregan I just wanted to in connection
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
with points raised by Representatives B
 
03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
being and Katon uh as you said you'd be
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
willing to entertain other possible ways
 
03:20:50.269 --> 03:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
ofing this I was also confused about
 
03:20:52.510 --> 03:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's a paradox I think in talking
 
03:20:54.990 --> 03:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
about remedies and preventions in the
 
03:20:57.469 --> 03:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
same Clause right remedies is to
 
03:20:59.070 --> 03:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
literally to remediate something which
 
03:21:00.790 --> 03:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
has already happened and to prevent
 
03:21:03.630 --> 03:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
something is to prevent something so uh
 
03:21:05.229 --> 03:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
in this case I also think it raises
 
03:21:08.189 --> 03:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
issues around uh also as representative
 
03:21:10.510 --> 03:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
kraton was saying are we talking about
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
remediation of something that is already
 
03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
been done which is one thing or we
 
03:21:16.229 --> 03:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
talking about taking active measures to
 
03:21:17.630 --> 03:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
prevent something else from happening
 
03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
and I actually think those are two
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
different functions and so maybe that's
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
something that's worthy of more
 
03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
discussion I think you're connected in
 
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
so far as um when you're pre the purpose
 
03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
of prevention is so that you then don't
 
03:21:30.670 --> 03:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
have to have a remedy down you know down
 
03:21:33.229 --> 03:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
the road so if we uh you know it's a lot
 
03:21:36.389 --> 03:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
easier to stop the damage from happening
 
03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
than to fix it after it happens so
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's that was my thinking but great
 
03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you okay oh um representative
 
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you um thank you madam
 
03:21:48.070 --> 03:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you representative poran
 
03:21:49.590 --> 03:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
um for taking my question I just wanted
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
to double check with you and maybe
 
03:21:54.630 --> 03:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh just make sure the Secretary
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
of State's office um it looks like the
 
03:21:59.790 --> 03:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
the question to be printed on the vot in
 
03:22:01.349 --> 03:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
the voters guide it just says the
 
03:22:03.070 --> 03:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution do we have any concern does
 
03:22:06.750 --> 03:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:08.710 --> 03:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
constitution did you repeat the question
 
03:22:11.229 --> 03:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
again sure I just wanted to make sure um
 
03:22:14.229 --> 03:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
in in the the Bill's direction thank you
 
03:22:18.269 --> 03:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
it's um it's section five yeah uh excuse
 
03:22:21.070 --> 03:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
me section seven lines um
 
03:22:24.030 --> 03:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
four5 and my question was it seems like
 
03:22:26.030 --> 03:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh that section directs the Secretary of
 
03:22:28.269 --> 03:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
State's office to print the voters guide
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it just said the Constitution I just
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
didn't know if um there was any concern
 
03:22:33.830 --> 03:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
making sure that it was enumerating the
 
03:22:37.590 --> 03:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
state constitution um May
 
03:22:39.990 --> 03:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
I this is a I mean this is an issue with
 
03:22:41.469 --> 03:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
all Constitutional Amendments that they
 
03:22:43.790 --> 03:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
have this this little summary of it uh
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
in the voter's guide and people aren't
 
03:22:47.429 --> 03:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
always satisfied with it I mean I think
 
03:22:50.710 --> 03:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I think I uh I mean I
 
03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't I wasn't dissatisfied with the
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
brief summary of and the voter's guy
 
03:22:55.790 --> 03:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
will also include you know the exact
 
03:22:57.710 --> 03:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
language of course which also appear in
 
03:23:00.830 --> 03:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
full on the ballot I mean that's uh I
 
03:23:02.710 --> 03:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
mean that is like an ongoing dispute
 
03:23:04.269 --> 03:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
over how to present constitutional
 
03:23:06.790 --> 03:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
amendments to the public at election
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
time so it's not just this is nothing
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
unique to that Amendment but um I think
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
that's come up in election law a number
 
03:23:14.710 --> 03:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
of times so
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
I'm you can uh I mean certainly that too
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
like the amendment is like the Tex
 
03:23:21.910 --> 03:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment itself is something that the
 
03:23:23.590 --> 03:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know the committee it's in your
 
03:23:25.269 --> 03:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
possession you have the right to to
 
03:23:28.189 --> 03:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
reword it if you think that's not a good
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
good summary but that's that's that's
 
03:23:31.830 --> 03:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
what the drafting attorneys came up with
 
03:23:33.990 --> 03:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it looked it looked good to me so
 
03:23:36.189 --> 03:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's why it's there I don't
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative BBY yeah so this is um
 
03:23:41.349 --> 03:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to a second committee
 
03:23:41.359 --> 03:23:42.229 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to a second committee
bill

03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee do you know if the second
 
03:23:48.870 --> 03:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
committee is uh election law um
 
03:23:52.110 --> 03:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
I tell you the truth I I don't know but
 
03:23:54.269 --> 03:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
that's maybe I misre I thought this was
 
03:23:56.670 --> 03:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
going is this a second committee uh let
 
03:23:59.790 --> 03:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
me look and see there's so many it is
 
03:24:01.550 --> 03:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
not an early b okay yeah it's not an
 
03:24:03.510 --> 03:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
early that's what I thought cancel that
 
03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
question yeah I know I mean I've done
 
03:24:08.469 --> 03:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
I've been on Judiciary which is
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
considered considered a cacr that pasted
 
03:24:12.670 --> 03:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of years go although I was
 
03:24:14.670 --> 03:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
actually personally opposed to that one
 
03:24:17.349 --> 03:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
so in that case um we were the only
 
03:24:18.830 --> 03:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
Committee in the house and then we sent
 
03:24:21.910 --> 03:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
it over to the over the Senate and you
 
03:24:23.670 --> 03:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
know went through the and
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
also yes I don't think this is going to
 
03:24:27.429 --> 03:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
a second committee I I'm not sure why it
 
03:24:29.309 --> 03:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
was scheduled for the first day which
 
03:24:32.150 --> 03:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
but that's my the first day is good as
 
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
any other day so here we
 
03:24:37.189 --> 03:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
are any other questions for
 
03:24:40.030 --> 03:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon oh I'm sorry
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
so in the state constitution I just
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out a couple things do
 
03:24:53.429 --> 03:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
you feel that um under article one where
 
03:24:55.150 --> 03:24:55.160 align:start position:0%
it says therefore all government of
 
03:24:57.110 --> 03:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
right originates from the people is
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
founded in consent and instituted for
 
03:25:02.510 --> 03:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
the general good don't you think that in
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
a sense uh covers a piece here of what
 
03:25:07.750 --> 03:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking for you know maintain a
 
03:25:10.189 --> 03:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
clean and healthful environment but in
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
some sense
 
03:25:14.349 --> 03:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
all the entire all of our rights come
 
03:25:16.189 --> 03:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
from you know are founded in consent
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
from the people so right there there's a
 
03:25:21.070 --> 03:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest with your with your
 
03:25:23.150 --> 03:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment because you're you're you're
 
03:25:24.950 --> 03:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
basically telling people what they have
 
03:25:27.150 --> 03:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
to do versus telling them what their
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
natural rights are so that's my first
 
03:25:32.710 --> 03:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
question and then I have a second
 
03:25:35.790 --> 03:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
one I mean that's that's probably true
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
of all the Articles you know the general
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
good is uh that's the overarching
 
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
principle and then we have uh you know
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
about over a hundred articles that uh
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
explicitly Define what the general good
 
03:25:48.670 --> 03:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
is so I don't
 
03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
think um I don't think that I don't
 
03:25:54.030 --> 03:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
think this one um I don't think this one
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
complaces with so-called natural right
 
03:25:57.229 --> 03:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
more than any other one does and of
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
course the word natural means like of
 
03:26:01.389 --> 03:26:01.399 align:start position:0%
nature so this amendment is about trying
 
03:26:03.710 --> 03:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
to protect the natural environment so in
 
03:26:06.630 --> 03:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
that case um that's not quite the same
 
03:26:09.830 --> 03:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
thing as a natural right so I don't see
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
a contradiction there but
 
03:26:14.229 --> 03:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
um I guess we I guess we disagree on
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
that but you have a followup I do have a
 
03:26:19.750 --> 03:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
followup so then of course under article
 
03:26:22.590 --> 03:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
two you have enjoying and defending life
 
03:26:25.269 --> 03:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
and Liberty acqu acquiring possessing
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
and protecting property and in word of
 
03:26:30.750 --> 03:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
seeking and obtaining happiness instead
 
03:26:32.910 --> 03:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
of having such a
 
03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
long paragraph here why couldn't CU
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
you've got something here just clean
 
03:26:41.070 --> 03:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
healthful environment why couldn't that
 
03:26:44.790 --> 03:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
be in there as one you know one one of
 
03:26:48.590 --> 03:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
the other comma in statements instead of
 
03:26:50.429 --> 03:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
because then you get into the legislate
 
03:26:52.389 --> 03:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
magistrat shall provide that's not
 
03:26:54.429 --> 03:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
really how the Constitution works and if
 
03:26:57.990 --> 03:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
you look at the last article here
 
03:27:00.590 --> 03:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
um you know no law changing the charter
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
or form of government in a particular
 
03:27:04.269 --> 03:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
city or town shall be enacted by the
 
03:27:06.550 --> 03:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
legislature except to become effective
 
03:27:08.269 --> 03:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
upon the approval of the voters of such
 
03:27:12.510 --> 03:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
town so article 39 and article 38 and 39
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
also contradict this a little bit um I'm
 
03:27:18.990 --> 03:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
not not sure just off the top of my head
 
03:27:20.309 --> 03:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I agree with that
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
analysis I mean certainly if you want to
 
03:27:24.630 --> 03:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
put it if you want to have a similar
 
03:27:26.990 --> 03:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
language somewhere else in another part
 
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution that's that's fine
 
03:27:31.630 --> 03:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
but this is a this seemed like they
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
seemed like an appropriate place to put
 
03:27:35.950 --> 03:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
it and goes right after a very long
 
03:27:38.189 --> 03:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph about uh what was it let me
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
get the exact thing form encouragement
 
03:27:43.110 --> 03:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
of literature trades Etc so that that
 
03:27:45.189 --> 03:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
seem like a place seemed to me like a
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
good place to put it um there are other
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
places you can put it so those um this
 
03:27:52.110 --> 03:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
is just about article to um that's
 
03:27:53.830 --> 03:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
certainly something the committee can
 
03:27:55.269 --> 03:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
you can discuss amongst yourselves at
 
03:27:59.950 --> 03:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
the work session so I this this is this
 
03:28:01.870 --> 03:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
is a this is what I came up in
 
03:28:03.309 --> 03:28:03.319 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the drafting attorneys
 
03:28:05.349 --> 03:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
it's not the only way to address the
 
03:28:08.870 --> 03:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
issue and of course uh it's already this
 
03:28:11.910 --> 03:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
issue is already implicitly um it's
 
03:28:14.189 --> 03:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
already it's already implicitly defined
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the Constitution but I
 
03:28:17.590 --> 03:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
think there's some value to explicitly
 
03:28:19.229 --> 03:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh defined it and that's what I think
 
03:28:21.630 --> 03:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
probably just about all the other 100
 
03:28:23.710 --> 03:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
plus articles in Constitution are doing
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
to you they all sort of grow out of the
 
03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
that first one so thanks representative
 
03:28:32.309 --> 03:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you very much thank you for
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
speaking here today representative organ
 
03:28:37.269 --> 03:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
um I take representative Pat's point
 
03:28:39.830 --> 03:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
because I think the first sentence has
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
potential as a useful part of the
 
03:28:44.189 --> 03:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution I think I have a real
 
03:28:46.110 --> 03:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
concern about what the Baseline of our
 
03:28:47.670 --> 03:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
environment is right now and how you
 
03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
would Define that Baseline we all know
 
03:28:51.070 --> 03:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
we don't live in a clean and healthy
 
03:28:53.229 --> 03:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
environment you know all when all is
 
03:28:55.710 --> 03:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
said and done um and where do you define
 
03:28:56.950 --> 03:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
that right now I don't know what Montana
 
03:28:58.670 --> 03:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
was like in the 1970s it probably also
 
03:28:59.950 --> 03:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
had environmental problems but I feel
 
03:29:01.870 --> 03:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
like 2023 New Hampshire we all know
 
03:29:02.910 --> 03:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
there's many pollutants in the
 
03:29:05.389 --> 03:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
environment and I don't know how you
 
03:29:07.710 --> 03:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
think about what's happened already and
 
03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
how you go forward so um I don't know if
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
you thought it I guess I'll make itan I
 
03:29:13.990 --> 03:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with any point I've never
 
03:29:16.670 --> 03:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
even uh never even been to Vermont I
 
03:29:20.229 --> 03:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
mean I've two friends who uh I do
 
03:29:22.229 --> 03:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
friends who grew up in bosma Montana the
 
03:29:24.110 --> 03:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
same place where the woman is now the
 
03:29:27.510 --> 03:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
uni ski team so I I mean I know it's uh
 
03:29:29.790 --> 03:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
State that's uh you know it's a very
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
state with a very small population like
 
03:29:35.229 --> 03:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
ours it's also one that's uh very proud
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
of its natural environment although it's
 
03:29:39.389 --> 03:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
also uh torned in other directions
 
03:29:41.189 --> 03:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
because has a large fossil fuel industry
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
in a large uh ranching industry but um
 
03:29:47.389 --> 03:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
so they and um certainly in the lawsuit
 
03:29:50.469 --> 03:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
they did you know the young people who
 
03:29:52.630 --> 03:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
who sued the state they did talk a lot
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
about what makes uh Montana unique like
 
03:29:58.189 --> 03:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
for example this woman georgana Fisher
 
03:30:00.349 --> 03:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not speaking on her on her behalf um
 
03:30:02.710 --> 03:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
but you know she was a uh she was a
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
skier and she grew up in an area that's
 
03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
a bosan is a major major ski resort and
 
03:30:09.229 --> 03:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
their economy has been uh you know
 
03:30:13.469 --> 03:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
affected by you know the uh the lack of
 
03:30:15.590 --> 03:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
snow in recent years the more
 
03:30:18.070 --> 03:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
unpredictable unpredictable climate and
 
03:30:21.910 --> 03:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
um all the other 15 uh 15 planers told
 
03:30:23.670 --> 03:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
stories about similar aspects of their
 
03:30:27.189 --> 03:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
experience so that's you know it's I'm
 
03:30:28.710 --> 03:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
not really not really not really that
 
03:30:30.910 --> 03:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
much of an expert on Montana but that's
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm probably on Solid Ground
 
03:30:35.910 --> 03:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
making at least those General
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
comments representative daty uh yes
 
03:30:41.910 --> 03:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'd like a point of
 
03:30:44.830 --> 03:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
clarification um if this bill is now
 
03:30:47.630 --> 03:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
owned by our committee okay and we will
 
03:30:50.070 --> 03:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
most likely have a work session on it
 
03:30:50.080 --> 03:30:51.309 align:start position:0%
most likely have a work session on it
would

03:30:51.309 --> 03:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:30:54.870 --> 03:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh Horgan be available at
 
03:30:57.750 --> 03:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
that work session to help us craft the
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill so that um you know I mean it seems
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
like we're trying to craft the bill here
 
03:31:08.469 --> 03:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
and and if it is our bill and we will
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
have a work session I'm wondering if we
 
03:31:12.750 --> 03:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
would just move on and have some of
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
these questions answered at that point
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
yes it's possible if we have a work
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
session that includes this bill I'm sure
 
03:31:22.349 --> 03:31:22.359 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan would know about
 
03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
it yes I'll do it do what I can I'm on
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee which is like
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
yours is a very busy committee but I'll
 
03:31:30.309 --> 03:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
I'll do I'll do whatever I can to be
 
03:31:34.469 --> 03:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
helpful so and this is um you know this
 
03:31:36.990 --> 03:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
this is not necessarily the only way to
 
03:31:39.229 --> 03:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
address this issue so representative
 
03:31:40.910 --> 03:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
Howard you had a question thank you
 
03:31:42.910 --> 03:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just to pile on
 
03:31:45.189 --> 03:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit with the word SMI smithing
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
it seems like if we were to take out the
 
03:31:49.469 --> 03:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
a few words it it would be more clear
 
03:31:52.269 --> 03:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
and more concise I would suggest um
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
taking out clean and in the health and
 
03:31:56.189 --> 03:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
just leave provide a healthful
 
03:31:58.830 --> 03:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
environment and take out the I would add
 
03:32:00.269 --> 03:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
natural in there healthful natural
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
environment and take out the two um
 
03:32:05.229 --> 03:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
phrases of adequate remedies for and
 
03:32:07.389 --> 03:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
just provide the protection of the
 
03:32:10.349 --> 03:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
environment and and again again I don't
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
mean to inter interupt you but that's
 
03:32:14.670 --> 03:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
the kind of uh comments we would deal
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
with in a work session
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay any other com uh questions for uh
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan on his
 
03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%

um the previous
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
bill cacr 14 we had uh for the online 33
 
03:33:36.870 --> 03:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
support we had 33 support foros four OPP
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
POS and there's no there was no blue
 
03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:48.229 align:start position:0%
POS and there's no there was no blue
sheet

03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:50.189 --> 03:33:50.199 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry um go ahead
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative par I'll introduce your
 
03:33:54.750 --> 03:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
bill and good afternoon good afternoon
 
03:33:59.389 --> 03:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:02.990 --> 03:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
you we have a bill before us that
 
03:34:05.710 --> 03:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
addresses waste reduction at the source
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
this is state in rsas is preferable over
 
03:34:09.990 --> 03:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
landfills or burning and before we
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
discuss those
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's good to have discussion of the
 
03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
means available for for Source reduction
 
03:34:18.990 --> 03:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
an epr is most promising of all these
 
03:34:22.670 --> 03:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
strategies um there are some concerns I
 
03:34:23.830 --> 03:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
understand that I have heard some
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
concerns such as
 
03:34:31.189 --> 03:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh epr uh will pass uh cost onto the
 
03:34:33.550 --> 03:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
consumer there's no evidence to back up
 
03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
this and in fact quite the opposite
 
03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
seems to be the case the little evidence
 
03:34:39.150 --> 03:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
we have is from a Canadian study and if
 
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
there were cost differences between PR
 
03:34:43.710 --> 03:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
nonpr provinces they were so slight as
 
03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
to be immeasurable we had testimony from
 
03:34:48.830 --> 03:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
Clark coron uh the program director for
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative Sol waste strategies and I
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
refer you to page 10 of the final report
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
which I hope you all had a chance review
 
03:34:59.070 --> 03:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
I know it's a hefty report 200 odd pages
 
03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
but uh I wish I had my copy here I tend
 
03:35:04.870 --> 03:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
of walked off that this morning um but
 
03:35:04.880 --> 03:35:05.870 align:start position:0%
of walked off that this morning um but
it

03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:35:09.469 --> 03:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
does provide testimony over three days
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
of many different interested parties all
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
who spoke in favor of VPR business um
 
03:35:19.110 --> 03:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
industry environmentalists all in favor
 
03:35:22.150 --> 03:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
of it at least in principle at that time
 
03:35:24.750 --> 03:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
we did not have a bill on which to base
 
03:35:28.469 --> 03:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
any solid critiques we do have that now
 
03:35:30.830 --> 03:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to keep this bill alive I
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
hope um now the consumer is already
 
03:35:37.389 --> 03:35:37.399 align:start position:0%
paying for these tipping fees we either
 
03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
be pay directly through our taxes or we
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
pay through tipping fees when we go to
 
03:35:43.750 --> 03:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
the dump so we're already paying to
 
03:35:45.870 --> 03:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
clean up well here's an example right
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
here I'm a musician a guitarist this is
 
03:35:51.550 --> 03:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
what I needed in order to my guitar work
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
the guitar string I ordered it from
 
03:35:57.070 --> 03:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
Amazon I hope I'm not plugging them
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
order it from a online company how's
 
03:36:01.710 --> 03:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
that they sent me the package I will be
 
03:36:04.349 --> 03:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
throwing that package away and they sent
 
03:36:06.630 --> 03:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
it in an envelope which will also be
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
thrown away so in order to get this I
 
03:36:11.590 --> 03:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
have to dispose of this and they did not
 
03:36:15.550 --> 03:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
ask me if I wanted to uh have this extra
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
burden upon myself and upon my
 
03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
municipality uh epr will lower the
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
playing field to make sure that the
 
03:36:25.389 --> 03:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
people who want to sell things like this
 
03:36:25.399 --> 03:36:26.550 align:start position:0%
people who want to sell things like this
will

03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
be have to answer to those people who
 
03:36:30.910 --> 03:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
are willing to sell it in a paper
 
03:36:34.189 --> 03:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
envelope and the like
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
so that's another advantage of
 
03:36:44.790 --> 03:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:46.990 --> 03:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
see as I said before this is the only
 
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
Bill directly dealing with waste
 
03:36:49.710 --> 03:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
reduction across the board I know there
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
are several concerns that will be
 
03:36:52.710 --> 03:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
addressed by people will be testifying
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
after me um one is
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh that it relies heavily on Source
 
03:37:01.510 --> 03:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
reduction I think that yes that is the
 
03:37:02.910 --> 03:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
goal but if we have a Level Playing
 
03:37:04.950 --> 03:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
Field and make sure that all the players
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
are involved to have a seat and a voice
 
03:37:10.510 --> 03:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
at the table um including the consumer I
 
03:37:13.630 --> 03:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
think we can mitigate any uh feeling of
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to have to pay for this
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
program if we all can come together
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
another criticism I think and I'm not
 
03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
sure if this is well founded is that it
 
03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
relies heavily upon uh Department of
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services oversight we are
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking to have one hire the Department
 
03:37:31.990 --> 03:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services not several as
 
03:37:34.990 --> 03:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
a financial report uh tends to indicate
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
one person to
 
03:37:39.670 --> 03:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
oversee what we call a producer
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization a nonprofit
 
03:37:45.189 --> 03:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
set up to Steward These funds and to
 
03:37:47.229 --> 03:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
make sure the funds are levied
 
03:37:47.239 --> 03:37:49.710 align:start position:0%
make sure the funds are levied
accordingly

03:37:49.710 --> 03:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about all I really
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
have to say about it maybe I could also
 
03:37:54.359 --> 03:37:55.870 align:start position:0%
have to say about it maybe I could also
add

03:37:55.870 --> 03:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
add
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh well there was I know my report
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
talked about we live in a free market
 
03:38:03.229 --> 03:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
Capital Society I'm not prepared really
 
03:38:05.870 --> 03:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
to in involve myself in an intellectual
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
discussion of the this nature at this
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
point I don't think it' be good for us
 
03:38:12.910 --> 03:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
but I will say that I was not elected by
 
03:38:15.469 --> 03:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
free market capitalists I was elected by
 
03:38:19.710 --> 03:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
constituents who uh wanted me to fairly
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
bring this matter forward to reduce
 
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
their the cost of their disposal cost
 
03:38:27.030 --> 03:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill does that by thank
 
03:38:30.790 --> 03:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
you representative parall um so I have a
 
03:38:30.800 --> 03:38:32.110 align:start position:0%
you representative parall um so I have a
question

03:38:32.110 --> 03:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:38:36.910 --> 03:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
that you chaired um a study committee on
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility correct
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
true okay
 
03:38:44.469 --> 03:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
was this bill written by the committee
 
03:38:46.229 --> 03:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
was this something that came out of the
 
03:38:48.670 --> 03:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
committee I wish it were written by the
 
03:38:50.269 --> 03:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
I was entire committee did have more
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
input we had one person was only able to
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
make half the meetings and um that makes
 
03:38:56.239 --> 03:38:57.030 align:start position:0%
make half the meetings and um that makes
it

03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
hard uh we had lots of testimony uh we
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
had things that we had model legislation
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
that we looked at from other states we
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
had a model that we looked at from a um
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
environmental organization
 
03:39:13.229 --> 03:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
and uh all those
 
03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
models discussed certain certain things
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
we do not discuss here in New Hampshire
 
03:39:19.469 --> 03:39:19.479 align:start position:0%
such as they were focusing on such
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
things as um incineration and the like
 
03:39:25.710 --> 03:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
this bill does not do that uh this bill
 
03:39:28.389 --> 03:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
focuses on one thing and that's getting
 
03:39:30.150 --> 03:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
a seat at the table for everybody who
 
03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
has to deal with our waste situation
 
03:39:36.110 --> 03:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:40.229 --> 03:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
consumers and and just as a followup so
 
03:39:43.389 --> 03:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
so that study committee came out of HB
 
03:39:50.229 --> 03:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
253 yes and there were specific um there
 
03:39:50.239 --> 03:39:52.750 align:start position:0%
253 yes and there were specific um there
were

03:39:52.750 --> 03:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
specific criteria that you were supposed
 
03:39:59.510 --> 03:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
to study from that yes we were do you
 
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
have the items that you were uh charged
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
to um study with
 
03:40:08.429 --> 03:40:08.439 align:start position:0%
that I I have them here and I can say
 
03:40:14.269 --> 03:40:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.279 --> 03:40:19.110 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:22.269 --> 03:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
um we examine existing epr laws in other
 
03:40:23.790 --> 03:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
States territories and international
 
03:40:27.630 --> 03:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions which we did um and we
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
were uh looked at possible targets for
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
epr including packaging single-use
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
Plastics beverage containers electronic
 
03:40:35.870 --> 03:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
waste batteries automotive waste and
 
03:40:40.269 --> 03:40:40.279 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste we did that um ass how
 
03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
these laws can be adop adapted to the
 
03:40:43.510 --> 03:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
existing Solid Waste Recovery
 
03:40:44.990 --> 03:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in New Hampshire I think
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the bill speaks to that direction
 
03:40:52.030 --> 03:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh solicit in Industry
 
03:40:53.750 --> 03:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input on approaches that
 
03:40:55.510 --> 03:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and Distributors would be
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
best able to undertake or facilitate we
 
03:40:59.750 --> 03:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
did our best in order to do that um we
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
did have some we had the New Hampshire
 
03:41:04.070 --> 03:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
beverage Association who I think they
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
are speaking later they have concerns
 
03:41:10.510 --> 03:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
but prior to the legislation and I State
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
CS generally true they generally are in
 
03:41:14.429 --> 03:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
favor of the idea of some form of
 
03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
03:41:20.349 --> 03:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility um Stak um let's see
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
suggest possible legislation we did that
 
03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes that that we we did there was
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
five areas there and I think we
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
addressed all of
 
03:41:34.830 --> 03:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you questions from the
 
03:41:37.830 --> 03:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative ger thank you
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
partial I just want to to clarify to
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
follow up on the the chair's question
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
but this is not a a a committee Bill
 
03:41:48.030 --> 03:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
correct so the bill doesn't have to
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
address all of those things that were
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
charged to the committee because it's
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
not a committee Bill am I am I wrong
 
03:41:55.070 --> 03:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
about that uh it is not a committee Bill
 
03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh we had three people at the end of the
 
03:42:03.070 --> 03:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh um study uh um committee
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
um address the need for further
 
03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
legislation uh Deborah El Schiller
 
03:42:10.590 --> 03:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
Senator El Schiller uh made a motion to
 
03:42:12.710 --> 03:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
draft further legislation was secreted
 
03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
by uh uh representative Arnold Davis and
 
03:42:18.510 --> 03:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
I was a third vote on that and we
 
03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
Advanced the idea of passing of
 
03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:22.349 align:start position:0%
Advanced the idea of passing of
submitting

03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
submitting
 
03:42:24.630 --> 03:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
legislation however with our and I I
 
03:42:26.229 --> 03:42:26.239 align:start position:0%
know we're all familiar with how our
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
office of legislative servic was swamp
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
this year um I got the bill in we
 
03:42:36.110 --> 03:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
drafted it and uh it was a real scramble
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
to look for sponsors so no it does not
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are not generally not
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily the ones who were on that
 
03:42:44.429 --> 03:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
committee thank you I just wanted to
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
begin with to clarify in terms of why
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
this bill may not address all of the
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
items that the committee was charged
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
with is because this is not a committee
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
Bill uh which it makes sense I I ask a
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
second question you may thank you uh so
 
03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
last night good time snowy uh evening I
 
03:43:05.670 --> 03:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
read both the Chairman's uh report from
 
03:43:07.030 --> 03:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
the study committee and The Minority
 
03:43:09.389 --> 03:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
Report I also read the new B anual Solid
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
Waste report report so a good time was
 
03:43:14.349 --> 03:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
had by all um and and looking at the the
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
banial solid waste report I see between
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
2023 in
 
03:43:24.309 --> 03:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
2045 in 2023 we are 27% behind our
 
03:43:27.510 --> 03:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
Target goal for for Waste reduction in
 
03:43:30.670 --> 03:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
2045 we are going to be more than 50%
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
behind our Target goals for Waste
 
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
reduction packaging constitutes about a
 
03:43:39.510 --> 03:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
quarter of what goes into our landfills
 
03:43:42.030 --> 03:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
so is it conceivable that we can make
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
any significant progress toward those
 
03:43:47.429 --> 03:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
waste reduction goals without seriously
 
03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
addressing the problem of packaging
 
03:43:50.830 --> 03:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
going into our
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
landfills I I believe that we cannot and
 
03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
I would also add to that I think this is
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
a prime time for us to proceed with
 
03:44:02.110 --> 03:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
setting resetting the table having both
 
03:44:04.269 --> 03:44:04.279 align:start position:0%
consumers and producers sit down
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
together and decide what's in the best
 
03:44:10.950 --> 03:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
interest of our long-term environment uh
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
I think we have a window of opportunity
 
03:44:15.389 --> 03:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
here and by 2045 that window will no
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
longer be available to us
 
03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
so again it comes back to I think while
 
03:44:23.070 --> 03:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
this bill I'll fully admit I think they
 
03:44:25.070 --> 03:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
probably will need some amending um but
 
03:44:26.590 --> 03:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
I I'm more than happy to help with that
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
work and I do think that it's a bill
 
03:44:30.990 --> 03:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
that I would hope makes it on the next
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
step I think we need to keep this
 
03:44:35.389 --> 03:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
conversation going for Source reduction
 
03:44:36.990 --> 03:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
I think there's a handout in fact going
 
03:44:40.110 --> 03:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
around that um indicates the priority
 
03:44:41.149 --> 03:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
that Department of Environmental
 
03:44:42.990 --> 03:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
Services puts on Source reduction it's
 
03:44:45.389 --> 03:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
our number one priority and I think up
 
03:44:46.950 --> 03:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
till now we have not been addressing
 
03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
that very effectively thank you thank
 
03:44:51.630 --> 03:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
you madam chair representative Murray
 
03:44:53.550 --> 03:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and thank you
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative I empathize with your um
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
some somewhat frustrations on the
 
03:45:02.349 --> 03:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
packaging um I recently was looking at
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
having some delivery of of some items to
 
03:45:07.870 --> 03:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
my home and uh there there has been a
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
move by industry to provide
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh recapture return programs such as
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
Terra cycle and many other types of
 
03:45:17.269 --> 03:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
things like that but one of the entities
 
03:45:19.389 --> 03:45:19.399 align:start position:0%
that I was looking at had none none of
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
that available to them and said it in
 
03:45:22.830 --> 03:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
fact it said this is not available in
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
your state um and it showed all of the
 
03:45:27.750 --> 03:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
packaging that would have come with it
 
03:45:29.910 --> 03:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
um that's the first time I've even uh
 
03:45:31.630 --> 03:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
seen to that degree where it enumerates
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
what types of packaging may have been
 
03:45:35.189 --> 03:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
included to that degree and that I had
 
03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
no other options if I was choosing to
 
03:45:39.550 --> 03:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
order it I would be stuck with what was
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
there there so I opted not to but in in
 
03:45:46.110 --> 03:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
in in any case my um my question to you
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
would be you enumerate in the bill um
 
03:45:50.830 --> 03:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
that the state com controller has
 
03:45:54.070 --> 03:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
oversight over the program we have been
 
03:45:56.030 --> 03:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh within this committee talking about
 
03:45:58.149 --> 03:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
oversight around online sales and online
 
03:46:01.149 --> 03:46:01.159 align:start position:0%
purchases for quite some time and I'm
 
03:46:04.269 --> 03:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
curious to know who would be overseeing
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
that portion of what you're trying to
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
address such as what you're uh what
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
you've presented like as a physical
 
03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
demonstration today
 
03:46:16.189 --> 03:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
MH well we know what's being brought
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
into the state we have their sales
 
03:46:22.030 --> 03:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
records um we also know that we can put
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
these hands into qualified producer
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility organizations nonprofits
 
03:46:32.110 --> 03:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
that specialize in ascertaining the
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
impact of the of this various packaging
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
and able to assess what uh the
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
what how to modulate fees in order to
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
discourage over production of packaging
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and one of the Beauties I think of in
 
03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
of extended producer responsibility is
 
03:46:56.229 --> 03:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
that the producers go into it knowing
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
that they will be paying a fee knowing
 
03:47:00.670 --> 03:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
that that fee will be they'll be able to
 
03:47:02.590 --> 03:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
modulate that fee by the choices they
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
make this will not Outlaw plastic
 
03:47:07.469 --> 03:47:07.479 align:start position:0%
packaging it will
 
03:47:10.110 --> 03:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully provide a level playing feel
 
03:47:13.630 --> 03:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
for them to consider alternatives look
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
if I go to and I was McDonald's a couple
 
03:47:18.269 --> 03:47:18.279 align:start position:0%
years ago I was delighted to get my
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
burger in a cardboard box my fries came
 
03:47:23.710 --> 03:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
in a a paper envelope and my drink was
 
03:47:26.149 --> 03:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
in a waxed paper cup I thought that was
 
03:47:28.269 --> 03:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
Splendid is it cost efficient can they
 
03:47:29.710 --> 03:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
compete with a burger joint next door
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
who's selling it in a styrofoam
 
03:47:34.269 --> 03:47:34.279 align:start position:0%
clamshell if I have stock in the company
 
03:47:36.389 --> 03:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
I want that company to make the product
 
03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
and deliver it as cheap as possible so I
 
03:47:41.309 --> 03:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
get as much profit from it but if I have
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
stock in my community and in my
 
03:47:45.910 --> 03:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
environment I want a Level Playing Field
 
03:47:48.030 --> 03:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
and if we can somehow make that more of
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
a Level Playing Field companies will
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
want to sell the products that you want
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the packaging that you want that you
 
03:47:56.229 --> 03:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
desire but we need to join with what
 
03:47:57.630 --> 03:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
most of the world is doing and what
 
03:47:59.550 --> 03:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
Canada has done what several states are
 
03:48:01.309 --> 03:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
already either currently engaged in or
 
03:48:03.510 --> 03:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
have legislation in front of them exent
 
03:48:04.750 --> 03:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility is something
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's being taken up across our nation
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
and the world and I think that if we
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't on board with it we're going to
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
end up
 
03:48:15.550 --> 03:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
being basically paying the cost of other
 
03:48:18.510 --> 03:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
people's uh efforts in this
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
area sorry for a little longwinded
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative kraton has a question and
 
03:48:25.469 --> 03:48:25.479 align:start position:0%
then representative Vick thank you
 
03:48:27.030 --> 03:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative I know you put a lot of
 
03:48:30.189 --> 03:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
hard work into this and the goals I
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
think are are admirable the the question
 
03:48:35.469 --> 03:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
I have is in implementation and you were
 
03:48:36.990 --> 03:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
just talking about
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
cost um and so the produc user going to
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
pay more for this end to endend
 
03:48:45.389 --> 03:48:45.399 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint it's going to cost the the
 
03:48:48.269 --> 03:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturer more to ship that product
 
03:48:50.790 --> 03:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
out because he's paying for the end
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
endend environmental impact so how have
 
03:48:56.149 --> 03:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
you figured out what that cost might be
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
to the consumer because at the end of
 
03:48:59.309 --> 03:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
the day the consumer is going to one
 
03:49:02.670 --> 03:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to absorb that cost and so
 
03:49:06.189 --> 03:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
how do you look at at that um especially
 
03:49:08.349 --> 03:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
in the environment we've been in where
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
Money's been tight across the board for
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
the last several years are we talking
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
about consumers how do we figure the
 
03:49:15.790 --> 03:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
cost uh in proportion to what their
 
03:49:18.269 --> 03:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
tipping fees and Municipal Taxes will be
 
03:49:20.670 --> 03:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
which we're already paying for the the
 
03:49:22.349 --> 03:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
product itself talk about if I go to buy
 
03:49:24.830 --> 03:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
that hamburger and McDonald's is
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for end to end environment
 
03:49:30.990 --> 03:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
how much how much more am I paying five
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
bucks for a whopper or am I paying 10
 
03:49:35.469 --> 03:49:35.479 align:start position:0%
bucks for a wer oh I see okay yeah yeah
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
well well this these costs be passed on
 
03:49:40.910 --> 03:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
to the consumer um the I will say
 
03:49:44.950 --> 03:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
that there is no empirical evidence that
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
shows that happens and the only study we
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
actually have and I'll be frank with you
 
03:49:53.429 --> 03:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
is a Canadian study that says that um
 
03:49:56.070 --> 03:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
the cost is negligible uh and I I really
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
mean legible less than a penny on a
 
03:50:02.950 --> 03:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
dollar for a um well even less than that
 
03:50:05.590 --> 03:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
you mean uh Chuck hson the guy from um
 
03:50:07.950 --> 03:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
who was part of the author was helped
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
author the uh or promote study um he was
 
03:50:14.990 --> 03:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
quite adamant this saying it's so small
 
03:50:19.469 --> 03:50:19.479 align:start position:0%
that it really is immeasurable um yeah I
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
would have the same concern I I can
 
03:50:22.670 --> 03:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
understand your concern wow where
 
03:50:24.030 --> 03:50:24.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay these uh
 
03:50:26.750 --> 03:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
fees but these fees will be Pennies on
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
their sale that's a very small
 
03:50:30.910 --> 03:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
percentage as far as we can tell
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
followup okay I I hear you but I'm
 
03:50:37.070 --> 03:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
confused if you're if
 
03:50:40.269 --> 03:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
you're adding an additional
 
03:50:42.790 --> 03:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
requirement onto these businesses how
 
03:50:43.830 --> 03:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
can it be
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
negligible what was the rationale on the
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
study that said that the cost increase
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
to the consumer was
 
03:50:53.710 --> 03:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
negligible what was the uh impetus for
 
03:50:56.950 --> 03:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
the study no no what why did they think
 
03:50:58.349 --> 03:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
that was true that it seems
 
03:50:59.790 --> 03:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive to
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
me oh that that if you put an additional
 
03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
requirement on businesses yes that then
 
03:51:10.830 --> 03:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
that creates a cost mhm that that
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
company would not pass that down to the
 
03:51:16.030 --> 03:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
consumer and I don't understand how it's
 
03:51:20.389 --> 03:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
a negligible cost well I I I I do
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
understand I mean your first your first
 
03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
thought would be that you know wow if
 
03:51:25.870 --> 03:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost more to make the
 
03:51:28.510 --> 03:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
product because they have to pay for the
 
03:51:31.229 --> 03:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh um producer fee then it's going to
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
cost more to the consumer but as I was
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
saying before
 
03:51:40.469 --> 03:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um the only benefit the only
 
03:51:42.070 --> 03:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
cost benefit we see to the consumer the
 
03:51:43.469 --> 03:51:43.479 align:start position:0%
only one we're able to measure is the
 
03:51:46.030 --> 03:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
one which has lowered their tipping fees
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
and lowered their Municipal tax cost
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
there's been no evidence that it has
 
03:51:52.349 --> 03:51:52.359 align:start position:0%
actually raised the prices of products
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
and the and as I said the only place
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
where they actually did try to study
 
03:51:57.469 --> 03:51:57.479 align:start position:0%
that was the Canadian provinces
 
03:51:59.710 --> 03:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
comparing to different provinces and
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
they found uh again no evidence that
 
03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
that actually occurs I you know I
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
understand your concern and I think this
 
03:52:06.990 --> 03:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
is something we need to watch out for
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
which is why we need really good a
 
03:52:12.429 --> 03:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
really good independent extended
 
03:52:14.429 --> 03:52:14.439 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility Watchdog
 
03:52:17.309 --> 03:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
organization which is Bill provides for
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't not do it through the
 
03:52:19.950 --> 03:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
department of inter final Services I
 
03:52:21.950 --> 03:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
should add um that's we're talking about
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
one position there not several um okay
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank so much representative Bixby you
 
03:52:30.189 --> 03:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
had a question yeah so
 
03:52:35.469 --> 03:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
um so how where are where are epr
 
03:52:40.030 --> 03:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
programs already in place and um uh what
 
03:52:42.269 --> 03:52:42.279 align:start position:0%
sort of track record do they
 
03:52:45.429 --> 03:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
have they are in place in South America
 
03:52:49.349 --> 03:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
Europe Asia Canada um most of the world
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
actually has gone this route Europe has
 
03:52:53.229 --> 03:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
led the way in it they've been doing it
 
03:52:55.349 --> 03:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
in in parts of Europe since
 
03:52:57.790 --> 03:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
1992 um so we do have some bit of a
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
track record run on as far as what how
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
they manage it
 
03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
um in the United States we have I last I
 
03:53:07.229 --> 03:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
think was four states have enacted
 
03:53:10.990 --> 03:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.389 --> 03:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
California Colorado and Maine um and
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
Maine is worth mentioning because the
 
03:53:19.990 --> 03:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
roll out on a program like this it's not
 
03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
you pass the bill today and everything
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
becomes fine tomorrow this will require
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
um impact studies it's require quite a
 
03:53:30.550 --> 03:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
bit of um leg work in order to get the
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
program up and running um and we don't I
 
03:53:34.469 --> 03:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
don't think want to make the mistake
 
03:53:35.790 --> 03:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
they made in Maine where they made
 
03:53:38.550 --> 03:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
exceptions for the paper industry and it
 
03:53:42.030 --> 03:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:44.349 --> 03:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
whole it put everything else out of
 
03:53:46.269 --> 03:53:46.279 align:start position:0%
balance the Plastics and other
 
03:53:48.309 --> 03:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
Industries felt like they were being
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
unfairly singled out and we want a fair
 
03:53:54.149 --> 03:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
Bell so I'm hoping that we can get that
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
um other states
 
03:53:59.110 --> 03:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I know that many other states
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
are considering it such as New York as
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
well I there's 17 States somebody else
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sure will have the information
 
03:54:06.349 --> 03:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
unless I knew was like 17 States had EPA
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
epr legislation in front of them
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative kulon was you had a
 
03:54:14.349 --> 03:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
followup yeah I had a follow I'm sorry
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
do a followup and then you're next so I
 
03:54:20.590 --> 03:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
I guess the followup is are all of those
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
epr programs uh related to are those
 
03:54:25.510 --> 03:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
just packaging programs or is that
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
covering the gamut of things like from
 
03:54:30.309 --> 03:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
Electronics to paint to whatever uh I
 
03:54:32.030 --> 03:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
think that yeah on a state state basis
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
they differ but primarily I think the
 
03:54:35.229 --> 03:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
four states I mentioned are concerned
 
03:54:38.070 --> 03:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
with packaging I should also add we have
 
03:54:40.149 --> 03:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
EP we already have extended producer
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility here in in New Hampshire
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
we were one of the first states in the
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
nation to pass extended producer
 
03:54:50.710 --> 03:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility for mercury um and we
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
have a model which is a small model but
 
03:54:56.910 --> 03:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
nevertheless it's something we can build
 
03:54:59.870 --> 03:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
on in order to expand that um it's
 
03:55:01.590 --> 03:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
effective it
 
03:55:04.110 --> 03:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
works representative kulan thank you
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:55:08.229 --> 03:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
question sir um I was wondering if you
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
have any concerns about epr policies
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
benefiting larger corporations over
 
03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
small businesses like for instance
 
03:55:19.630 --> 03:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
Budweiser might invite you know epr to
 
03:55:22.910 --> 03:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
have an advantage over like a smaller uh
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
local Craft brewery for instance there
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
is a part of the bill that addresses
 
03:55:29.550 --> 03:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
that very situation because I feel very
 
03:55:31.110 --> 03:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
sensitive for our homegrown New
 
03:55:34.110 --> 03:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses and I already feel
 
03:55:37.429 --> 03:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
like we are often already at a B big
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
disadvantage uh there there is a carve
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
out so that uh they will be given time
 
03:55:46.030 --> 03:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
additional time in order to incorporate
 
03:55:48.110 --> 03:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
the policies they need to do in order to
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh comply with epr
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh I think that's
 
03:55:54.790 --> 03:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
important to maintain and I thank you
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
for interested in that too it's a big
 
03:55:58.870 --> 03:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
one may I ask where in the bill that
 
03:56:02.510 --> 03:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
carve out is um I'd have to look for it
 
03:56:04.229 --> 03:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
but uh if you want to give me I would
 
03:56:07.269 --> 03:56:07.279 align:start position:0%
gladly do that or
 
03:56:09.389 --> 03:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
um or I can get back to you later
 
03:56:11.070 --> 03:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you prefer your preference you
 
03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
can get back to me later okay
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
representative NAB you had a question
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair um I
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up on
 
03:56:19.229 --> 03:56:19.239 align:start position:0%
representative kraton's question and
 
03:56:21.229 --> 03:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand from a packaging
 
03:56:24.269 --> 03:56:24.279 align:start position:0%
standpoint um does it also just include
 
03:56:25.870 --> 03:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
mindfulness about how things are
 
03:56:27.510 --> 03:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
packaged we all have the example of the
 
03:56:29.070 --> 03:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
giant box that comes with one little
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
tiny thing in it or a company choosing
 
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
to use something that's recyclable
 
03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
versus not or smaller packaging or you
 
03:56:38.189 --> 03:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
know there's been this real push to over
 
03:56:40.229 --> 03:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
Packaging things it feels like so is
 
03:56:41.550 --> 03:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
that part of extended producer
 
03:56:44.110 --> 03:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility or is it a real shift in
 
03:56:44.120 --> 03:56:45.269 align:start position:0%
responsibility or is it a real shift in
required

03:56:45.269 --> 03:56:45.279 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:56:47.469 --> 03:56:47.479 align:start position:0%
materials I think to some degree it will
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
be a shift but would not be a hard one I
 
03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
think there are many people like myself
 
03:56:53.469 --> 03:56:53.479 align:start position:0%
who are already out there looking for
 
03:56:55.630 --> 03:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
environmental answers such as re
 
03:56:57.710 --> 03:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Murray mentioned earlier
 
03:57:01.309 --> 03:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
um looking for these Solutions and I'm
 
03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
delighted when I uh as I said go to
 
03:57:05.790 --> 03:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
McDonald's and they give me my burger
 
03:57:08.870 --> 03:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not in a styrofoam clamshell I
 
03:57:11.309 --> 03:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
not a big fan of their but but you know
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
would make me want to go back there it
 
03:57:14.630 --> 03:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
would make me want to support a business
 
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's looking sustainability for
 
03:57:18.389 --> 03:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
the planet rather than raising my
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
disposal cost yeah and I think that
 
03:57:24.030 --> 03:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
there is also Pro a provision for
 
03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
educating the consumer in the bill a
 
03:57:30.030 --> 03:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
small amount of epr funding can go to
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
that end and um I think that's also
 
03:57:37.149 --> 03:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
going to be key in making this bill work
 
03:57:38.710 --> 03:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
I should you know speaking of funding by
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
the way can I can I
 
03:57:43.830 --> 03:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
add um it's I think it's very important
 
03:57:46.189 --> 03:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
I think industry would agree with it
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
that any fees collected go directly to
 
03:57:51.269 --> 03:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
managing the program I don't think
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to be in the position of
 
03:57:55.149 --> 03:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
having this become a tax upon
 
03:57:57.870 --> 03:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
industry um bless you maintaining a
 
03:57:59.950 --> 03:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
program is one thing using the money to
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh benefit General funds I think we need
 
03:58:04.389 --> 03:58:04.399 align:start position:0%
to be very careful about that which is
 
03:58:06.389 --> 03:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
why we need an inspector General the
 
03:58:09.870 --> 03:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Services thank you
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh I have I have a question and then you
 
03:58:13.910 --> 03:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'm interested to know for the
 
03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
study committee how many businesses came
 
03:58:21.950 --> 03:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
and uh testified uh to your committee or
 
03:58:23.630 --> 03:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
provided comments I should be able to
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
find that one a lot quicker if you can
 
03:58:28.030 --> 03:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
just let me pull up my uh I do
 
03:58:30.670 --> 03:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
everything with PDFs my apologies but I
 
03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
tend to be a paperless
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
person um we
 
03:58:40.429 --> 03:58:40.439 align:start position:0%
had and and if you look at the final
 
03:58:43.790 --> 03:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
report it's I think it's on the in the
 
03:58:43.800 --> 03:58:48.830 align:start position:0%
report it's I think it's on the in the
index

03:58:48.830 --> 03:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:00.429 --> 03:59:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:03.630 --> 03:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
page well we can move along and
 
03:59:06.030 --> 03:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative you can you can uh ask
 
03:59:07.510 --> 03:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
your question I don't want to hold
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
things up thank you madam shair um
 
03:59:13.309 --> 03:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
representative uh paral are you aware
 
03:59:15.229 --> 03:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
that in I believe it was the Sunday
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
conquered monitor there was a big
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
article on Recycling and one of the
 
03:59:22.389 --> 03:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
things that was interesting about that
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
was was some of the cost of the Tipping
 
03:59:28.229 --> 03:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
fees um for example The Tipping fee for
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
Willer wheer has gone from $30 a ton to
 
03:59:36.910 --> 03:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
$90 a ton and one of the things that um
 
03:59:39.349 --> 03:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
the article indicated was that that town
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities were not able to really
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
control these costs because it was a
 
03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
matter of function you know of supply
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
and demand uh but I noticed in your bill
 
03:59:52.510 --> 03:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
um that it it appears that you have
 
03:59:55.469 --> 03:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
incentives included in this so that
 
03:59:59.309 --> 03:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers can change their packaging
 
04:00:01.950 --> 04:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
reduce the weight of their packaging and
 
04:00:04.910 --> 04:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
therefore um their costs associated with
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
the program will go down um is is that
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
correct or am I reading something into
 
04:00:12.189 --> 04:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
it yeah no that's correct there's a $5
 
04:00:14.670 --> 04:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
term for that called Echo modulation
 
04:00:17.070 --> 04:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
where they're rewarded they can reduce
 
04:00:20.309 --> 04:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
their fees by selecting more
 
04:00:22.950 --> 04:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
environmentally friendly packaging and
 
04:00:25.550 --> 04:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
like I said before I think that many
 
04:00:27.030 --> 04:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
companies would like to do that but they
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
look at the cost of it and they're um
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
concerned about that Level Playing Field
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
that we all want to participate on and
 
04:00:36.269 --> 04:00:36.279 align:start position:0%
this and Echo modulation what that
 
04:00:38.309 --> 04:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
actually does is level the playing field
 
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
field for them and makes it fair for all
 
04:00:42.229 --> 04:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
parties concerned I'd like to think it
 
04:00:45.070 --> 04:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
does that's that's the entire intent of
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
the bill right there in fact I'm
 
04:00:49.469 --> 04:00:49.479 align:start position:0%
not representative Murray you have a
 
04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair um
 
04:00:53.590 --> 04:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative parshall for
 
04:00:56.149 --> 04:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
04:00:58.030 --> 04:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
around the fee structure which I am
 
04:01:01.950 --> 04:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
assuming will be enumerated in rules um
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
and then to follow to follow up if I may
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
yep um I know noticed on page 17 line
 
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
three that it says that the new
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
subparagraph applications of receipts is
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund am I also to assume
 
04:01:19.349 --> 04:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
that that's a non-aps fund If This Were
 
04:01:21.229 --> 04:01:21.239 align:start position:0%
to be stood up is this intended to be
 
04:01:23.510 --> 04:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
stood up in
 
04:01:28.030 --> 04:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
perpetuity um I believe that it does say
 
04:01:30.910 --> 04:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
non-aps doesn't it I well I don't see
 
04:01:33.389 --> 04:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
that in the bill perhaps it just says
 
04:01:37.510 --> 04:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund on page 17 line three yes
 
04:01:41.950 --> 04:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
so but it does not not say non-aps Okay
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
um this
 
04:01:47.750 --> 04:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes I don't have a good answer for that
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
right now I'd have to go back and I look
 
04:01:54.469 --> 04:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
further on deeper into the bill and um
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's all I can say okay thank you
 
04:01:57.520 --> 04:02:03.070 align:start position:0%
that's all I can say okay thank you
representative

04:02:03.070 --> 04:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:05.710 --> 04:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
Penza so being new on the committee I
 
04:02:07.630 --> 04:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of history with you
 
04:02:09.550 --> 04:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
know here everything that you have and
 
04:02:11.630 --> 04:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
and have read through some of this but
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
not enough to digest it all I just
 
04:02:16.590 --> 04:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
wanted this kind of goes back to um I've
 
04:02:19.429 --> 04:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
been following this for a long time and
 
04:02:22.149 --> 04:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
especially in regards with plastic
 
04:02:24.670 --> 04:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
so this we're not looking at it from a
 
04:02:27.870 --> 04:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
producer standpoint for incentives for
 
04:02:30.070 --> 04:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
example like federal tax incentives for
 
04:02:32.229 --> 04:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
someone that's going to be producing
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
something with corn and compostable what
 
04:02:37.790 --> 04:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
those Dan plant-based bottles all of
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
that kind of kind of stuff so for
 
04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
example if you're a business and you're
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing those like be good or there's
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
a place in Dober that has that they use
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
all their straws and all they're all
 
04:02:51.070 --> 04:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
compostable that there's a tax incentive
 
04:02:53.469 --> 04:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
for them doing that as well as we're
 
04:02:54.990 --> 04:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
producing that stuff you know here in
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
our country um so we have less of that
 
04:03:01.670 --> 04:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
waste like right from the source MH it
 
04:03:04.349 --> 04:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
was uh asked by one Committee Member if
 
04:03:07.309 --> 04:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
we could provide a tax incentive in New
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to do much of the same but the
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
problem is that we don't have that kind
 
04:03:13.510 --> 04:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
of those kind of taxes in New Hampshire
 
04:03:14.830 --> 04:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
I know and we'd have to incorporate
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
those kind of taxes if you want to give
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
an inside of and I think
 
04:03:22.189 --> 04:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
that it's just I do do not want to bring
 
04:03:25.229 --> 04:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
up the Spectre of taxes um I know that's
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
a very divisive issue um I I love the
 
04:03:31.389 --> 04:03:31.399 align:start position:0%
federal tax incentives I think they they
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
work well but I don't think it's
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
something that we can apply here in New
 
04:03:37.389 --> 04:03:37.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah because the big big
 
04:03:39.790 --> 04:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
plastic produc and all of that they're
 
04:03:41.710 --> 04:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
pennies you know how you were talking
 
04:03:43.630 --> 04:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
about Pennies on the dollar right not
 
04:03:45.429 --> 04:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
well Pennies on the dollar to them is
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
millions of millions of dollars so
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
they're never going to shift to that
 
04:03:52.990 --> 04:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
kind of unless there's an incentive um
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
to do so and not just protecting our
 
04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
environment is enough so but but the
 
04:04:00.950 --> 04:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
whole idea of as I said before that big
 
04:04:03.550 --> 04:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
$ five wor of echo modulation that
 
04:04:05.389 --> 04:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
provides the incentive they're paying
 
04:04:07.630 --> 04:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
into a fund that they can get a rebate
 
04:04:07.640 --> 04:04:08.750 align:start position:0%
into a fund that they can get a rebate
from

04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:04:12.550 --> 04:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
depending upon how they uh um choose to
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
Market to package their product and if
 
04:04:17.550 --> 04:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
they choose that it's not only going to
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
help them to reduce their cost but it's
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
going to help on the other end with all
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
of these tipping fees that we're so
 
04:04:26.590 --> 04:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about that are skyrocketing
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
right now and our landfill sighting and
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
all of our you know environmental
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with where we put all of this
 
04:04:34.950 --> 04:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
rubbish as I said at the very beginning
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
this is one of the very few bills that I
 
04:04:38.510 --> 04:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
know of right now before the house
 
04:04:40.790 --> 04:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
that actually deals with Source
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
reduction making less garbage not how to
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
deal with the garbage we have but
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
actually making less and I think it
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
would benefit both consumers and
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
producers to have a seat at the table in
 
04:04:54.189 --> 04:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
order to figure this one out thank you I
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question no it's
 
04:04:58.510 --> 04:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
great thank you any other questions from
 
04:05:01.309 --> 04:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Bixby yeah
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
so uh you said that there was a
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism for um helping out uh local
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
businesses and I I'm wondering if it's
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
if you're referring to uh in um on page
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
five line 11 section Roman five a
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
producer is exempt from the requirements
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
and prohibitions of the
 
04:05:25.870 --> 04:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
subdivision uh uh in a calendar year in
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
which the producer is realized less than
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
a million dollars in gross revenues
 
04:05:32.590 --> 04:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
during the PRI prior calendar year or
 
04:05:34.790 --> 04:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
the producer sold offers for sale or
 
04:05:37.189 --> 04:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
distributed for sale products contained
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
protected deliver presented and
 
04:05:41.229 --> 04:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
distributed in or using less than one
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
ton of packaging
 
04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
material uh is that what you were
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
thinking of in terms of the protection
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
yes that is that is exactly the Clause I
 
04:05:50.590 --> 04:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
was looking I thank you for finding that
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
I hope that helps mson of Coulson so
 
04:05:55.950 --> 04:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
would reading that would it be
 
04:05:57.670 --> 04:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate to think that someone who
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
was uh using the poultry the the
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
Thousand bird poultry exemption would
 
04:06:07.110 --> 04:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
not come under the epr rules for their
 
04:06:10.149 --> 04:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
um the plastic wraps or uh vacuum wraps
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
around their chickens because they just
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have they would neither meet
 
04:06:17.189 --> 04:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
the income nor the packaging volume
 
04:06:20.429 --> 04:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
requirements I think that I that that
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
being the point it helps to preserve
 
04:06:25.550 --> 04:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
some of our smaller New Hampshire
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and uh gives some you know a
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
little little footing against larger uh
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
corporations thank you so to follow up
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
on that what is the rationale for those
 
04:06:37.800 --> 04:06:39.510 align:start position:0%
on that what is the rationale for those
particular

04:06:39.510 --> 04:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:06:42.030 --> 04:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
thresholds uh those thresholds were
 
04:06:42.040 --> 04:06:43.550 align:start position:0%
thresholds uh those thresholds were
recommended

04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
um by I think was the
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh clf I believe recommended them I
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
can't say to that um but they were
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
recommended and they they seemed
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable to me and that's all I will
 
04:06:58.750 --> 04:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
say I do think that as we go down and
 
04:07:01.870 --> 04:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
study this problem situation I think
 
04:07:03.790 --> 04:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
that there will be much to reconsider
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
Maine enacted their uh extended producer
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility three four years ago and
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
they still are tweaking it out and doing
 
04:07:15.550 --> 04:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
lots of Ru making um so I guess what I
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
really answer that representative ER is
 
04:07:19.469 --> 04:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
that it's a starting point I don't think
 
04:07:22.469 --> 04:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
it's a would necessarily have to remain
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
a fixed point but it's a starting point
 
04:07:27.870 --> 04:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
from which we can use in order to draw
 
04:07:27.880 --> 04:07:28.710 align:start position:0%
from which we can use in order to draw
rules

04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
out so am I correct in saying that this
 
04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a boiler plate pulled
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
off the shelf legislation model leg
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
legislation from somewhere oh or this
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is not tailored at all to I mean
 
04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
with with regard to you saying it would
 
04:07:50.109 --> 04:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
have to be tweaked um so this is not
 
04:07:53.109 --> 04:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
really reflecting New Hampshire there is
 
04:07:57.070 --> 04:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
a whole part of the bill also which I
 
04:07:59.070 --> 04:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
decided to
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate I read several bills and I
 
04:08:05.070 --> 04:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
you know I mean did I plagiarize other
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
bills uh by drafting this one um I
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
borrowed heavily I won't deny that
 
04:08:12.510 --> 04:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
because they work effectively in other
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
places however there are places that I
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
expect people have questions on and I
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
think that they're probably going to be
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
good questions I have a whole list of
 
04:08:23.950 --> 04:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
toxins uh deeper on in the bill that I
 
04:08:23.960 --> 04:08:24.750 align:start position:0%
toxins uh deeper on in the bill that I
think

04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:08:28.030 --> 04:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
that I would expect industry to at least
 
04:08:30.670 --> 04:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
take a good hard look at I would expect
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
them to do that I included them uh under
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation um I'm willing to
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
negotiate and the inclusion of them upon
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation but it does the bill does
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
have those Provisions in there so that
 
04:08:49.269 --> 04:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
we don't end up uh three years from now
 
04:08:51.429 --> 04:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
saying oh yeah we finally got a good
 
04:08:53.870 --> 04:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill except it doesn't do anything for
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
our small New Hampshire businesses we
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
left them out I did not want to do that
 
04:09:01.469 --> 04:09:01.479 align:start position:0%
so I no I don't think it's boiler plate
 
04:09:04.429 --> 04:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
I think it's what I was able to borrow
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
from different legislation in order to
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh come up with a bill that I think
 
04:09:12.950 --> 04:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
would maybe not work off the shelf in
 
04:09:15.550 --> 04:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but would be a positive
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
step in the direction of something that
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
will effectively reduce our tipping cost
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
so this
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
is um so yeah no I so I guess I would
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
say I don't really see it as a boiler
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
plate so I I would
 
04:09:33.790 --> 04:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
say thank you any other questions
 
04:09:33.800 --> 04:09:35.630 align:start position:0%
say thank you any other questions
representative

04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
Penza so following up that same section
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
on page five line uh I think it's line
 
04:09:47.550 --> 04:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
four or section four it basically says
 
04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
that the producer shall annually submit
 
04:09:51.630 --> 04:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
to both the department and the packing
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
reduction organization a written
 
04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
declaration signed by the chief
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
executive off officer verifying the
 
04:09:59.189 --> 04:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
producer's compliance with and then it
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
gives you know the rsas
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
so in a sense there's not really going
 
04:10:07.630 --> 04:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
to be anybody overseeing or policing
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
that that's really going to be on you
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
know they're going to be on their honor
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
in doing it
 
04:10:16.109 --> 04:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
correct we we will have in place the
 
04:10:18.109 --> 04:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
bill provides for a producer
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
responsibity organization which will
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
shepher their their numbers they give
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
and you know how much verification
 
04:10:28.990 --> 04:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to do
 
04:10:31.469 --> 04:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
um I suppose if we need to go back and
 
04:10:34.229 --> 04:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
verify we could also find access through
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
online sales and the like too I don't
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
think it'd be a total you know trusting
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
the producer okay but I think there's a
 
04:10:45.950 --> 04:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
place where we we began there can I have
 
04:10:50.429 --> 04:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
a followup sure um so there's like four
 
04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
different businesses that you know we've
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
been frequently um you know one a couple
 
04:10:58.510 --> 04:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
of food service places one's a kind of
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
an organic uh type store um that where
 
04:11:03.790 --> 04:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
you can eat at as well and they've been
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
doing this for years now I have to say
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
that they're if you went and probably
 
04:11:10.990 --> 04:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
got similar food at another place you
 
04:11:11.000 --> 04:11:12.309 align:start position:0%
got similar food at another place you
could

04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
save three four dollars on each meal
 
04:11:17.229 --> 04:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
just because they are I mean the ones
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about you you do you're
 
04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
spending a lot more but they're I mean
 
04:11:24.109 --> 04:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
all of their stuff is like I said
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
compostable um made with the corn prop
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
all of that it's it's wonderful so um
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
these folks depending on if they qualify
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
would be able to have this type of
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
incentive the ones that have been doing
 
04:11:39.149 --> 04:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
doing it for several years now in the
 
04:11:40.750 --> 04:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
state most definitely
 
04:11:42.910 --> 04:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh they would not be penalized
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
they've been doing it for several years
 
04:11:46.189 --> 04:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would trickle down
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
to us and maybe we could have less we
 
04:11:51.309 --> 04:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
could spend less money on the food well
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
I hope as it trickles down to us and we
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
have less uh you know Municipal tipping
 
04:11:57.109 --> 04:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
cost and lowers our taxes that's that's
 
04:11:59.469 --> 04:11:59.479 align:start position:0%
that's a big one for the right
 
04:12:02.830 --> 04:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
there yeah the food the C thank
 
04:12:02.840 --> 04:12:04.429 align:start position:0%
there yeah the food the C thank
representative

04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
Bixby so in terms of the
 
04:12:09.870 --> 04:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
the way that the program is
 
04:12:12.630 --> 04:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
overseen uh tell me if I'm getting this
 
04:12:18.070 --> 04:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
right so there's a um P which is a u
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
packaging reduction organization they
 
04:12:22.189 --> 04:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
are sometimes called that as well yes
 
04:12:24.309 --> 04:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
and that is that would be a private
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
sector organization that the state would
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
hire yes we would contract with them
 
04:12:34.349 --> 04:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
and then and so so de Dees would be in
 
04:12:36.990 --> 04:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
charge of doing the hiring for that and
 
04:12:37.000 --> 04:12:38.429 align:start position:0%
charge of doing the hiring for that and
then

04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh there and you would also have a
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
Inspector General within Dees that would
 
04:12:49.349 --> 04:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
sort of overse the pro yes okay so so
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
that so we have the pro that is
 
04:12:56.469 --> 04:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
basically uh getting lining up all the
 
04:12:58.349 --> 04:12:58.359 align:start position:0%
companies that have things sold in
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
packaging in um in New Hampshire and the
 
04:13:06.109 --> 04:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
prro would get paid by those packagers
 
04:13:10.030 --> 04:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
and overseen by those packagers and then
 
04:13:12.309 --> 04:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
the money from that would go to a
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
combination of municipalities and Dees
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
and the cost of running the
 
04:13:25.309 --> 04:13:25.319 align:start position:0%
pr and then uh so the so if the pr so um
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
how does how does the bit with the
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities getting money work and
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
what what does the what do they get
 
04:13:33.149 --> 04:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
money for doing
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
that how what does that money go towards
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:43.269 --> 04:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
um well the main purpose of it is
 
04:13:43.279 --> 04:13:46.510 align:start position:0%
um well the main purpose of it is
to

04:13:46.510 --> 04:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
reduce the actual bulk of what's being
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
brought into the state and the
 
04:13:54.429 --> 04:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
municipality will benefit from having
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
that Source reduction their tipping fees
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
will be reduced because of that Source
 
04:14:05.070 --> 04:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
now M will also be able to I think well
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
at least as far as education goes which
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
was something which one of the committee
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
members wanted to see more education
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
funding they they'll be able to ask for
 
04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
Educational Funding around these areas
 
04:14:19.469 --> 04:14:19.479 align:start position:0%
in order to further the goals of their
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
um recycling whatever follow up followup
 
04:14:24.910 --> 04:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead so uh so would that money to
 
04:14:27.830 --> 04:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
the municipalities also go towards
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
helping recycle a larger range of
 
04:14:32.189 --> 04:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
packaging that they might that might
 
04:14:35.109 --> 04:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
still be coming in maybe smaller volume
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
but larger range like more than just one
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
and two
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
I I I can't say for certain that is what
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
the their they would choose to do with
 
04:14:46.109 --> 04:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
any municipality but I I think that the
 
04:14:48.429 --> 04:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
industries would like to have more
 
04:14:50.670 --> 04:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
access to these materials and they make
 
04:14:52.349 --> 04:14:52.359 align:start position:0%
it easier for them to recycle so I think
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
that at least in theory industry would
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
be behind having accessibility to those
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
materials and so yes I I answer thank
 
04:15:04.590 --> 04:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:15:07.030 --> 04:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
kto thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
question um I'm listening to the
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
testimony here today and we're talking a
 
04:15:14.830 --> 04:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
lot about tipping
 
04:15:17.790 --> 04:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
fees and how that is great for
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities and for taxpayers because
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
we'd be reducing tipping fees um through
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
this program is that correct that's
 
04:15:24.800 --> 04:15:26.070 align:start position:0%
this program is that correct that's
correct

04:15:26.070 --> 04:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:15:26.080 --> 04:15:27.950 align:start position:0%
correct
yes

04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:15:30.309 --> 04:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
so the question becomes if we're
 
04:15:31.950 --> 04:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
reducing tipping
 
04:15:31.960 --> 04:15:33.950 align:start position:0%
reducing tipping
fees

04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
fees
 
04:15:38.910 --> 04:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
um would how would these places that are
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
accepting the trash stay in business if
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
they're not getting the same amount of
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
money and I'm just playing you know
 
04:15:49.710 --> 04:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
devil's advocate here but they're also a
 
04:15:52.030 --> 04:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
business and how would this affect
 
04:15:53.790 --> 04:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
them I think there'll be somebody
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
speaking after me that can say a lot
 
04:15:58.429 --> 04:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
more about the impact of um our current
 
04:16:01.510 --> 04:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
waste flow has on our municipalities um
 
04:16:02.550 --> 04:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
I believe there's somebody who will be
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
testifying later um but I will say that
 
04:16:09.070 --> 04:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
considering our current landfill
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
situations and what's leeching into our
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
environment in an uncontrolled nature
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
um I don't lie awake at
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
night worried about trying to keep the
 
04:16:26.030 --> 04:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh our landfills full in New Hampshire I
 
04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
think that problem pretty much takes
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
care of
 
04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
itself representative Murray thank you
 
04:16:33.429 --> 04:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you for taking
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
my question one of the things I keep
 
04:16:38.349 --> 04:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about is um um the difference
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
between recapturing and recycling
 
04:16:44.149 --> 04:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
products um and I do think that based on
 
04:16:46.429 --> 04:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
I think to um the question that
 
04:16:48.590 --> 04:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby made um when we
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
talked about expanding Plastics other
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
than one and twos or commodity based
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
prices based on you know those available
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
recycled materials I'm curious to know
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
um whether or not you've made a clear
 
04:17:03.469 --> 04:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
delineation between recapturing programs
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
versus recycling programs because they
 
04:17:07.710 --> 04:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
are because they are different yes I can
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
understand that and then this bill I
 
04:17:10.830 --> 04:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be very Frank with you it probably
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
does not address that as fully as
 
04:17:16.349 --> 04:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps it could um which again you know
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
if I could have put a bookmark in there
 
04:17:21.630 --> 04:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
for that the way that we had bookmarks
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
for education and for uh small
 
04:17:27.109 --> 04:17:27.119 align:start position:0%
businesses you know it would be it would
 
04:17:29.349 --> 04:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
give us something to work with and I
 
04:17:30.750 --> 04:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
think that's an important point and I
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
think that it's worth discussing as part
 
04:17:37.630 --> 04:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
of this legislation or any other future
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
legislation yes representative germ I
 
04:17:42.790 --> 04:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
had a question yes thank you very much
 
04:17:44.229 --> 04:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair and I just want to follow
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
up on representative K's question uh
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
which I think is an important question
 
04:17:51.070 --> 04:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
for us to focus on because the number
 
04:17:53.790 --> 04:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
one goal in our waste managed strategy
 
04:17:56.670 --> 04:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
is reduction right so uh wouldn't the
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
same thing apply to any plan that leads
 
04:18:02.950 --> 04:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
to the reduction of how much we landfill
 
04:18:04.389 --> 04:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh we are supposed to be moving
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
progressively toward putting Less in
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
landfills which will drop tipping fees
 
04:18:10.830 --> 04:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh so while I understand where the
 
04:18:13.229 --> 04:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
representative is is coming from isn't
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
the actual point of our Solid Waste
 
04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
Management plan precisely to do
 
04:18:21.109 --> 04:18:21.119 align:start position:0%
that yes I I
 
04:18:25.830 --> 04:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
I yes yes yes thank
 
04:18:28.109 --> 04:18:28.119 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for
 
04:18:28.119 --> 04:18:30.149 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for
representative

04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:18:32.710 --> 04:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
parshall oh representative
 
04:18:36.030 --> 04:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
Bixby so you have a a definition of
 
04:18:37.870 --> 04:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
toxic material materials and I'm I'm
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
having trouble locating exactly where
 
04:18:42.630 --> 04:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
you have it in the in the bill but I was
 
04:18:44.830 --> 04:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if that toxic materials
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
definition was uh something that you
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
came up with on your own or whether you
 
04:18:54.590 --> 04:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
organization uh there
 
04:18:59.550 --> 04:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
were at least two other bills I looked
 
04:19:01.950 --> 04:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
at that had something of this nature in
 
04:19:03.710 --> 04:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
it and I thought it was important at
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
this time to include that so uh yes from
 
04:19:09.870 --> 04:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
other bills yes so I I guess part of my
 
04:19:12.870 --> 04:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
concern is that the some of the things
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
that are used to characterize a toxic
 
04:19:19.510 --> 04:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
material are um are really fairly broad
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh and uh one of the so
 
04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
um part of the issue with something
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
being toxic is how much so if we have
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
one part per billion of pasas that's a a
 
04:19:39.030 --> 04:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
fair amount of pasas if we have one part
 
04:19:41.429 --> 04:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
of billion per billion of table salt
 
04:19:44.950 --> 04:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's not so much but if you don't
 
04:19:46.950 --> 04:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
include the quantity that makes
 
04:19:50.429 --> 04:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
something toxic if you have if you put
 
04:19:52.990 --> 04:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
um 100 pounds of table salt in your well
 
04:19:57.149 --> 04:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
your well is now toxic so I'm I'm I'm
 
04:19:59.950 --> 04:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
worried about the definition of toxic
 
04:20:01.469 --> 04:20:01.479 align:start position:0%
not being
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
sufficiently uh um precise to make it
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
clear what actually counts as toxic and
 
04:20:13.109 --> 04:20:13.119 align:start position:0%
what doesn't for the purposes of
 
04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
packaging yes I and and again I will say
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
that I see some of these areas as
 
04:20:22.910 --> 04:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
negotiable okay and I think that's
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
important to I
 
04:20:27.870 --> 04:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
mean I would have liked I'll be frank I
 
04:20:31.109 --> 04:20:31.119 align:start position:0%
would like this have been a committee uh
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
legislation was asked earlier on if
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's was represent myself or the
 
04:20:35.520 --> 04:20:37.030 align:start position:0%
that's was represent myself or the
committee

04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:20:39.109 --> 04:20:39.119 align:start position:0%
um we had an opportunity to study this
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
in depth and uh now granted we did have
 
04:20:44.830 --> 04:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
a very short amount of time to do it in
 
04:20:48.910 --> 04:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
and I I and that's the nature sometimes
 
04:20:50.990 --> 04:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire politics
 
04:20:55.149 --> 04:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
but but I do feel that collaboration is
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
important on a bill like this and we
 
04:20:58.830 --> 04:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
need to have as many different
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
viewpoints as possible and as many much
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
critique as possible on it I'm hoping
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
going forward uh any concerns like this
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
can be part of an amendment that will
 
04:21:12.670 --> 04:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
further the bill rather than uh
 
04:21:15.429 --> 04:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
dismissing the bill is because it does
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
not parse to certain levels so just to
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
be clear I am incredibly impressed with
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
the amount you've managed to pull
 
04:21:25.469 --> 04:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
together that most of which is really
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
quite solid and uh it would be really
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
kind of unbelievable to do something
 
04:21:33.750 --> 04:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
this long and complex with no flaws
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so I'd like to congratulate
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
you on on this on your initial start
 
04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
with this I I suspect we'll probably
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
need to spend a certain amount of time
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
working on amendments and I hope that
 
04:21:46.429 --> 04:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
you'll uh help us with that process I
 
04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:48.119 align:start position:0%
would very much relish that opportunity
 
04:21:50.189 --> 04:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank you for your kind
 
04:21:52.590 --> 04:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
words any other
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative paral
 
04:21:57.109 --> 04:21:57.119 align:start position:0%
for introducing your bill and fielding
 
04:22:00.790 --> 04:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
all these questions oh that's my
 
04:22:04.950 --> 04:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
pleasure I'd like to call next um to
 
04:22:07.109 --> 04:22:07.119 align:start position:0%
testify um

the record my name is Mike whimet I
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
serve as director of the uh Waste
 
04:22:51.630 --> 04:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
Management division for the New
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
Services and with me I'm joined uh today
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
by Michael norc who heads up our
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
materials management and planning
 
04:23:02.590 --> 04:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
section um we're happy to be here before
 
04:23:04.830 --> 04:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
you to talk about House Bill
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
1630 um
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
I I want to start by saying that the
 
04:23:12.349 --> 04:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
concept of uh extended producer
 
04:23:14.309 --> 04:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility is something that's been
 
04:23:16.389 --> 04:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
talked about in many sectors not just
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
for packaging but for other other
 
04:23:21.109 --> 04:23:21.119 align:start position:0%
materials um and it's a it's a concept
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
that the department is receptive to We
 
04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
believe that um Extended producer
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility can be very effective and
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor representative parall
 
04:23:31.870 --> 04:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
indicated um actually New Hampshire was
 
04:23:33.389 --> 04:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
something of a Pioneer in that with
 
04:23:35.309 --> 04:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
respect to Mercury many many many years
 
04:23:38.109 --> 04:23:38.119 align:start position:0%
ago and that that program um with with a
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
lot of participation by many of the New
 
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
England states the northeastern states
 
04:23:43.630 --> 04:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
and then eventually across the country
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
um has become very popular and very uh
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh successful to the point where a
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
number of states are you know kind of
 
04:23:52.389 --> 04:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
ramping their their efforts down because
 
04:23:54.189 --> 04:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
they they feel like the the products
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
they were trying to address have been
 
04:23:59.910 --> 04:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
addressed so I again I want to open with
 
04:24:00.990 --> 04:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
that because I think that's something
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's important for for this committee to
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
understand that that approach is
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
something that the department is very
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
receptive to and supportive of um having
 
04:24:11.790 --> 04:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
said that um we do have some concerns
 
04:24:13.790 --> 04:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
about House Bill 1630 obviously has been
 
04:24:16.349 --> 04:24:16.359 align:start position:0%
a rather uh a lengthy you know
 
04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
discussion with the sponsor about
 
04:24:21.070 --> 04:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
questions about how this would work um
 
04:24:22.990 --> 04:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
the primary concern that the department
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
has though I think is really a very
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
practical one and that is that we it is
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
an FN Bill we were asked to do a fiscal
 
04:24:31.469 --> 04:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
impact worksheet and we did that and uh
 
04:24:32.950 --> 04:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
when we looked at all the various
 
04:24:34.990 --> 04:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
requirements and and and tried to kind
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
of school ourselves on how the bill
 
04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
would work uh we concluded that it may
 
04:24:40.109 --> 04:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
take as many as eight positions for us
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
to implement this program which is we
 
04:24:44.109 --> 04:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
don't I I don't say that very often
 
04:24:46.269 --> 04:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
that's a it's a pretty big number and uh
 
04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
of course the bill does not make
 
04:24:50.790 --> 04:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation for any of those positions
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
so really based on that alone um the
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
department is not in a position to
 
04:24:57.349 --> 04:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh because we we
 
04:24:59.670 --> 04:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
believe that um you know there would
 
04:25:01.710 --> 04:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
need to be provision for that and
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations made and um it's not
 
04:25:06.670 --> 04:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
clear to us that
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
that that this partic well I guess I'll
 
04:25:13.870 --> 04:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
start I'll continue by saying that
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
um we believe epr as I said is very is
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
an is an approach that can work but we
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
believe it really needs to involve some
 
04:25:23.710 --> 04:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
kind of critical mass of states that are
 
04:25:26.070 --> 04:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
working that are looking at similar if
 
04:25:30.389 --> 04:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
not identical legislation to set up um
 
04:25:33.750 --> 04:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh Frameworks and implementers that can
 
04:25:36.510 --> 04:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
do it on a at least a regional if not a
 
04:25:40.429 --> 04:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
national basis so that it is both easy
 
04:25:42.750 --> 04:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
and understandable for the industry to
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
implement and easy and understandable
 
04:25:48.030 --> 04:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
and coste effective for the states to
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
implement and so for that those reasons
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
we think that this isn't quite ripe yet
 
04:25:54.510 --> 04:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
we're certainly it sounds like there's a
 
04:25:56.469 --> 04:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
lot of interest and a lot of you know
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement on the part of the
 
04:25:59.229 --> 04:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor that this may need some this
 
04:26:01.750 --> 04:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill may need some work and Dees is more
 
04:26:03.630 --> 04:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
than happy to participate in discussions
 
04:26:06.189 --> 04:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
about how the bill could be amended to
 
04:26:08.950 --> 04:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
to make it more achievable but at this
 
04:26:10.349 --> 04:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
point my understanding is we have about
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
three states in the union that have
 
04:26:15.830 --> 04:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
passed laws with respect to epr um I
 
04:26:17.670 --> 04:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
think perhaps the one that is most
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
closely aligned with this bill would be
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
what Maine has done although it's by no
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
means the same um and they've been at it
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
for a few years now and they're still
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
working on rules so these and we don't I
 
04:26:30.429 --> 04:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
I will I don't want to T I'm not spoken
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
directly with my counterparts in Maine
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
about this yet and I certainly will do
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
that but my understanding is that there
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
they're struggling a bit in getting this
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
launched and uh what we'd like to do is
 
04:26:42.269 --> 04:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that if we were to go into
 
04:26:44.349 --> 04:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
something like this as a state we really
 
04:26:46.590 --> 04:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
understood how it would work and and we
 
04:26:48.030 --> 04:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
we want to be successful we'd want to
 
04:26:49.950 --> 04:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
meet the deadlines in the in the bill
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
and make sure we set up a program that
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
was effective and cost effective for the
 
04:26:59.070 --> 04:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
state I have a question and so I know
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
that you are a participating member of
 
04:27:03.269 --> 04:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
group to what extent has the solid waste
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
working group um discussed epr and epr
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
legislation um and have they do they
 
04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on on how this would
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
be implemented in New Hampshire the the
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
group has certainly talked about epr as
 
04:27:25.030 --> 04:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
a concept and in in in wide ranging
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
discussions as we were working on our
 
04:27:28.710 --> 04:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management plan it was
 
04:27:30.429 --> 04:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
recognized that epr can play a
 
04:27:33.070 --> 04:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
meaningful role in reaching the goals of
 
04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
our plan which include waste reduction
 
04:27:39.070 --> 04:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
and Disposal reduction um so so in the
 
04:27:40.630 --> 04:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
general sense I think the group is
 
04:27:43.630 --> 04:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
certainly um on board with that concept
 
04:27:45.109 --> 04:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know that they've talked I don't
 
04:27:46.269 --> 04:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
believe they've talked about this
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
specific Bill thank you representative
 
04:27:53.109 --> 04:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
kraton and then
 
04:27:57.670 --> 04:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr whimet for your your
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
input it brings something that it hadn't
 
04:28:03.670 --> 04:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
occur to me and so as you read the
 
04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill if I'm Manufacturing
 
04:28:09.790 --> 04:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
something in Massachusetts for example
 
04:28:13.710 --> 04:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
and selling it in New Hampshire how do
 
04:28:18.030 --> 04:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
I how does this Bill affect my
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
business well and I I will be honest I
 
04:28:22.830 --> 04:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I fully understand how this
 
04:28:24.990 --> 04:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
bill I'm sure I don't fully understand I
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
don't really understand maybe even some
 
04:28:27.790 --> 04:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
of the fundamental ways that this bill
 
04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
would work it's a little bit confusing
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
to me but I my understanding would be
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
anybody no matter where they are that
 
04:28:35.389 --> 04:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
markets products that are P are
 
04:28:37.710 --> 04:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
contained in packaging in the state
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
would be potentially um subject to
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
assessment of a fee for the with somehow
 
04:28:46.870 --> 04:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately prated to the amount and
 
04:28:48.590 --> 04:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
the type of material that they are
 
04:28:51.469 --> 04:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
selling in New Hampshire and that this
 
04:28:54.189 --> 04:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility organization
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
would be responsible ultimately for um
 
04:29:00.109 --> 04:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
assessing that fee and collecting that
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
fee and then as time went on and it
 
04:29:06.790 --> 04:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
matured a bit a couple year years and uh
 
04:29:10.510 --> 04:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities would be in a position to
 
04:29:12.429 --> 04:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for some of their costs
 
04:29:16.109 --> 04:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
for recycling from a fund that would be
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
set up to to to for those fees to be
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
collected as well as the cost that de
 
04:29:24.630 --> 04:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire the state incurred to
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
administer the program one of the
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
concerns we have is that we think that
 
04:29:31.229 --> 04:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
the collection of those fees would not
 
04:29:33.750 --> 04:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
happen for some time and the state would
 
04:29:36.670 --> 04:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
be required to but the state has a lot
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
of work to do to get to that point so
 
04:29:40.830 --> 04:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
that we would be having to hire the
 
04:29:43.030 --> 04:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
staff and and do the work and incur the
 
04:29:46.710 --> 04:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
costs of the uh initial uh uh study
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's required as well so that there
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
would be no money in the system other
 
04:29:53.630 --> 04:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
than State money until that happened and
 
04:29:56.349 --> 04:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
then not really entirely clear to us how
 
04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
much money would be collected or how
 
04:29:59.790 --> 04:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
that would how that would work okay
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray thank
 
04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and uh thank you
 
04:30:08.229 --> 04:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
director uh for taking my question so as
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
aside from the um PR that would be stood
 
04:30:14.070 --> 04:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
up potentially are you aware of in these
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
other three states are there any other
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
public private Partnerships that states
 
04:30:22.030 --> 04:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
are dealing with to deal to help address
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh maybe some of your concerns about the
 
04:30:25.830 --> 04:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
eight additional staff members that you
 
04:30:25.840 --> 04:30:27.269 align:start position:0%
eight additional staff members that you
would

04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
have we'd certainly look into that I I
 
04:30:32.349 --> 04:30:32.359 align:start position:0%
my and again not a student of what
 
04:30:33.790 --> 04:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
exactly is happening in these other
 
04:30:36.750 --> 04:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
states my understanding are my belief is
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
that Maine has engaged a pro or the
 
04:30:43.269 --> 04:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a pro under their law but
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know how far along they are
 
04:30:44.720 --> 04:30:46.469 align:start position:0%
I don't know how far along they are
beyond

04:30:46.469 --> 04:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
04:30:49.910 --> 04:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
that representative NAB thank you madam
 
04:30:51.309 --> 04:30:51.319 align:start position:0%
chair thank you director for taking my
 
04:30:53.429 --> 04:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
question um do you have any sense of how
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
a regional approach would even work or
 
04:30:57.109 --> 04:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
if there's precedent for that with
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
environmental issues because we hear a
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
lot about we're New Hampshire and we
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
don't care what this other state is
 
04:31:05.710 --> 04:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
doing so I mean is there not for I hope
 
04:31:09.469 --> 04:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
oh no not from you at all um is there a
 
04:31:12.670 --> 04:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
a real path for that to happen I I I
 
04:31:14.870 --> 04:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
think there is yes um and the first one
 
04:31:16.830 --> 04:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
is the one that I mentioned uh in my in
 
04:31:19.550 --> 04:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
my testimony and that is the the um
 
04:31:21.630 --> 04:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
Mercury reduction or IMC the
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
international Mercury and reduction
 
04:31:25.870 --> 04:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
Clearing House I can't remember what the
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
E stands for but um it is a program that
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
um is actually administered by the
 
04:31:34.030 --> 04:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
Northeast Waste Management officials
 
04:31:35.670 --> 04:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
Association of which New Hampshire is a
 
04:31:37.870 --> 04:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
member that's a eight member uh
 
04:31:40.309 --> 04:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
organization of the northeastern states
 
04:31:42.309 --> 04:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
um and they Waste Management officials
 
04:31:44.349 --> 04:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
and and I've been involved in it ever
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
since I became director and the agency
 
04:31:47.990 --> 04:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually is a founding member of the
 
04:31:49.830 --> 04:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
organization it was it was created back
 
04:31:49.840 --> 04:31:50.710 align:start position:0%
organization it was it was created back
in

04:31:50.710 --> 04:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:31:53.070 --> 04:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
1986 their real purpose is to help the
 
04:31:54.990 --> 04:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
states collaborate on waste management
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
issues and in fact one of the early
 
04:31:59.870 --> 04:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
things that they did was to work on imar
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is this Clearing House and and
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
basically States got together and said
 
04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
we we've got a real problem with
 
04:32:07.630 --> 04:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
contamination and we need to do
 
04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
something about it we need to get it out
 
04:32:11.550 --> 04:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
of products and um we want to do it in a
 
04:32:13.950 --> 04:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
way that is is that's manageable that we
 
04:32:16.750 --> 04:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
can all effectively do um that makes it
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
easy for industry to comply with it
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
because that's that's when compliance
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
happens is when you make it easy to
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
comply so they created this um imur
 
04:32:26.189 --> 04:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
which is basically a clearing house
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's run by neoa and it collects all
 
04:32:29.710 --> 04:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
the information there's a lot of
 
04:32:31.950 --> 04:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements associated with
 
04:32:33.550 --> 04:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of products that have
 
04:32:35.870 --> 04:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
mercury added to it and I it started
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
with some of the obvious things like you
 
04:32:38.910 --> 04:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
know blood pressure cuffs and
 
04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
thermometers I but it really branched
 
04:32:42.510 --> 04:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
out to a lot of other products where we
 
04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
knew we had Mercury fluorescent bulbs
 
04:32:47.109 --> 04:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
Etc and the idea was that there would be
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
a requirement for those manufacturers to
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
report on the contenter Mercury and as
 
04:32:55.309 --> 04:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
these things were either phased out or
 
04:32:57.109 --> 04:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
banned that mercury was Bann in certain
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
products there'd be a a requirement for
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
those organizations for those
 
04:33:02.469 --> 04:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to report that they were
 
04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
compliant or if they weren't to report
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
when they would become compliant and uh
 
04:33:08.590 --> 04:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
the states that worked together at New
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was a leader in that and
 
04:33:14.029 --> 04:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
actually it was sort of stood up and uh
 
04:33:16.269 --> 04:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of staff there there was at
 
04:33:18.590 --> 04:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
least one staff member in Dees who was
 
04:33:21.230 --> 04:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
active on imer group with num MOA for
 
04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
for many many years and continues to
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
this day and that worked really
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
effectively because it what it meant was
 
04:33:30.750 --> 04:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
there was this um database and and folks
 
04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
managing a regional system or what
 
04:33:36.269 --> 04:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
really became a national system system
 
04:33:39.109 --> 04:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
um at very little cost to the individual
 
04:33:42.029 --> 04:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
states but together their resources
 
04:33:44.109 --> 04:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
really help solve this problem and so I
 
04:33:45.869 --> 04:33:45.879 align:start position:0%
think that's the example that that I'm
 
04:33:47.070 --> 04:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
thinking of I mean that's a little
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
different because we're we're not
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily just talking about reporting
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
here we've got the fee structure and all
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
that so there's a little more going on
 
04:33:56.990 --> 04:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
um there are more recently there are um
 
04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's a similar organization uh
 
04:34:01.150 --> 04:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
called um the intern Interstate
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
Chemicals Clearing House or ic2 that is
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
also administered through neoa
 
04:34:07.949 --> 04:34:07.959 align:start position:0%
it has pretty National reach not every
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
state is a member and in fact New
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's not a member yet because we
 
04:34:12.750 --> 04:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a program that it administers
 
04:34:14.670 --> 04:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
so there's no point in but we're certain
 
04:34:16.349 --> 04:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
I I hear about it every time I meet with
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
neoa the neoa board and it's something
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
we're looking at with regard to other
 
04:34:24.429 --> 04:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
other possible initiatives but they um
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
administer something called the HP CDs
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
or the high priority chemicals database
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
in that system there's a number of
 
04:34:33.590 --> 04:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
states that do have laws about um the
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
presence of toxics particularly in in
 
04:34:37.310 --> 04:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
children's products that sort of thing
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
so they identify they collect a lot of
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%
general information about a list of high
 
04:34:45.029 --> 04:34:45.039 align:start position:0%
priority chemicals chemicals of concern
 
04:34:47.070 --> 04:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
and then they actually do have modules
 
04:34:49.070 --> 04:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
for states that have laws on the books
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
about toxic materials in children's
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
products or in other products um they
 
04:34:56.349 --> 04:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
will basically it still cost money they
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
they'll pay to develop a state module
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
that will sort of be a a collection
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
point for all the
 
04:35:06.109 --> 04:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who are subject to it to
 
04:35:08.830 --> 04:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
go to One-Stop shopping they go to ic2
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
they make their reporting they provide
 
04:35:13.910 --> 04:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
their information and um and so as a
 
04:35:15.390 --> 04:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
result again it's easy for the
 
04:35:16.830 --> 04:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers because they go to one
 
04:35:18.910 --> 04:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
place to provide the information and
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
then the individual states spend far
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
less money than they would if they had
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
to stand that program and framework all
 
04:35:27.789 --> 04:35:27.799 align:start position:0%
up on their own so that's a long answer
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
to say yes to your question
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
representative Gera thank you madam
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh first of all I have to Marvel
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
at your ability to hold acronyms in your
 
04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:39.799 align:start position:0%
head you must dream and acronyms which I
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
don't envy um so I'm going to ask you a
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
a different slightly different iteration
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
of a question I asked representative
 
04:35:48.390 --> 04:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
partial based upon the most recent Solid
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
Waste uh management report uh so given
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
the projected shortfall uh compared to
 
04:35:57.629 --> 04:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
our reduction goals over the next 20
 
04:36:00.269 --> 04:36:00.279 align:start position:0%
years or so number one uh and number two
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
given the fact that our recycling rates
 
04:36:04.750 --> 04:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
remain largely unchanged from the 2018
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
to 2020 period so given those two kind
 
04:36:11.230 --> 04:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
of data points how feasible is it for us
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
to make a serious movement toward
 
04:36:16.349 --> 04:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
achieving those waste reduction goals
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
without seriously packaging p uh
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
tackling the issue of
 
04:36:23.470 --> 04:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
packaging I think packaging is
 
04:36:24.789 --> 04:36:24.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely has to be part of the
 
04:36:26.830 --> 04:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
equation it's it represents a
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of the waist stream
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
so we absolutely need to make progress
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
on reducing packaging in order to meet
 
04:36:35.789 --> 04:36:35.799 align:start position:0%
any of our waste reduction goals
 
04:36:35.799 --> 04:36:38.629 align:start position:0%
any of our waste reduction goals
thank

04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:42.551 --> 04:36:42.561 align:start position:0%
you represent Bixby yeah so um I'm
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
wondering if uh you think that uh this
 
04:36:48.029 --> 04:36:48.039 align:start position:0%
is in a some somewhat more abstract
 
04:36:52.109 --> 04:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
level is the model of having uh
 
04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
p uh oversee the uh interface between
 
04:36:57.000 --> 04:36:58.029 align:start position:0%
p uh oversee the uh interface between
the

04:36:58.029 --> 04:36:58.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and the uh and the state
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the packaging waste
 
04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
reduction is that a an appropriate model
 
04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
and is it just a question of how we get
 
04:37:12.629 --> 04:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
there I I I think I'm not sure about all
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
the very specifics of this model but the
 
04:37:17.949 --> 04:37:17.959 align:start position:0%
the general model of having an external
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
organization handle the information
 
04:37:22.349 --> 04:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
collect the information calculate fees
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
on a regional or national basis assess
 
04:37:27.349 --> 04:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
and collect those and then interact with
 
04:37:29.349 --> 04:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
the states I yes absolutely think that
 
04:37:32.349 --> 04:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
can work I I do think that there's this
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
and it's frustrating I know but it's
 
04:37:36.629 --> 04:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
some of there is a it's going to be
 
04:37:37.830 --> 04:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to have a certain critical
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
mass of states that are looking to
 
04:37:43.269 --> 04:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
implement a similar or identical program
 
04:37:45.629 --> 04:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
in order to make it cost effective and
 
04:37:47.709 --> 04:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
and actually make it work without it
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
being a really big lift for individual
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
states represent Biby followup so
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh let let's say I I know this is not
 
04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
your preference but let's say that we
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
decide that we do want to go forward
 
04:38:05.629 --> 04:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
with this uh you had eight uh you you
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
calculated that you'd need eight new uh
 
04:38:11.390 --> 04:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
positions in order to to run this would
 
04:38:14.189 --> 04:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
you need those all at the outset or
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
would is that something or would those
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
positions become necessary uh as the
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
program got further developed because we
 
04:38:23.390 --> 04:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
know it's not going to happen instantly
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
no matter what we do I think some of
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
them may be phased in but the the
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
implementation schedule for the bill is
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
really only two years long we we're if
 
04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
it passes in 20 um or I should have few
 
04:38:37.470 --> 04:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
years it it basically becomes effective
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
I think in 26 or no excuse me in 24 and
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
then by uh 28 so four years later
 
04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
everything's supposed to be set up in
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
municipality should be getting
 
04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursements so um in that four-year
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
period you know we have in the very
 
04:38:55.470 --> 04:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
first year if it passes if it becomes
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
effective September 24 one year later in
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
September 25 we're to have
 
04:39:02.910 --> 04:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rules adopted which means
 
04:39:04.470 --> 04:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
we would need to begin working on those
 
04:39:04.480 --> 04:39:05.390 align:start position:0%
we would need to begin working on those
rules

04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
even if we could figure out what they
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
should say right away in order to get
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
them adopted within a year so you're
 
04:39:12.310 --> 04:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
going to need staff to do that we're
 
04:39:14.230 --> 04:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
going have to we're also in order to
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
inform that rul making we'd really
 
04:39:17.230 --> 04:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
probably need to do the study that's
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
required to be done every five years so
 
04:39:22.109 --> 04:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
we'd have to have somebody to uh put
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
together a um an RFP for that study do a
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
selection and then work with the
 
04:39:29.709 --> 04:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
selected contractor to get the study
 
04:39:31.629 --> 04:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
completed there's a lot of work here to
 
04:39:33.310 --> 04:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
be done and and there's a number of
 
04:39:34.629 --> 04:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
components to this that are really new
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
to us I I'm not saying hasn't never
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
happened before but I'm not I don't
 
04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
think I've ever testified on a bill that
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
required us to stand up in office of
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
Inspector General in the department so
 
04:39:48.510 --> 04:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
um and then have a regular annual audit
 
04:39:50.910 --> 04:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
beyond our normal auditing procedures so
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of components to this and
 
04:39:53.948 --> 04:39:53.958 align:start position:0%
that's what drove up that number of
 
04:39:55.868 --> 04:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
positions that we're just not accustomed
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
to seeing that in a bill of this nature
 
04:39:58.440 --> 04:39:59.788 align:start position:0%
to seeing that in a bill of this nature
thank

04:39:59.788 --> 04:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:40:03.070 --> 04:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
you uh representative kulan thank you
 
04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you uh Mr whimet
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
so do we know if Maine or Oregon or any
 
04:40:12.990 --> 04:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
of these other states are actually
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
collecting data or providing evidence to
 
04:40:18.750 --> 04:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
show proof of concept before we go and
 
04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
spend over a million dollars by next
 
04:40:21.200 --> 04:40:22.510 align:start position:0%
spend over a million dollars by next
year

04:40:22.510 --> 04:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
potentially I I really don't know much
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
about where I don't Mike if you have any
 
04:40:27.310 --> 04:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
more information about where those
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
states are I I know very little about
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
where they are in their process um based
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
on my understanding all states in the US
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
that have a law on the books haven't
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
actually implemented them as of yet
 
04:40:40.070 --> 04:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're kind of in the preliminary
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
stages like Maine is still developing
 
04:40:45.310 --> 04:40:45.320 align:start position:0%
rules Colorado I think has just selected
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
a pro but hasn't actually implemented
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
the program California I think is still
 
04:40:51.868 --> 04:40:51.878 align:start position:0%
working on implementation as well so
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be rolling out uh in
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
the in the next coming years but it's
 
04:40:57.510 --> 04:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's not there yet and so we don't
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily at least from where I sit
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
and what I've been kind of tracking uh
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any actual implementation
 
04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
of yet follow up sure so we have yet to
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
see proof of concept that e actually
 
04:41:14.030 --> 04:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
States I I think there may well be other
 
04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
examples of epr working but in this in
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
this packaging realm I'm not I'm not
 
04:41:22.470 --> 04:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
sure we have um evidence of that in in
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
yet any other questions from the
 
04:41:31.510 --> 04:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I want to thank
 
04:41:34.150 --> 04:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
you so much for your time and coming to
 
04:41:37.310 --> 04:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
testify by and lend us your insights on
 
04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
this important bill you're welcome thank
 
04:41:43.948 --> 04:41:43.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:48.430 --> 04:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to Now call up um Tom
 
04:41:52.030 --> 04:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
Irwin the conservation law Foundation
 
04:42:03.030 --> 04:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
speak m members of committee please put
 
04:42:08.910 --> 04:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
um microphone thank thank you madam
 
04:42:13.150 --> 04:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you members of the committee
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Tom Irwin I
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
direct the New Hampshire office of
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation uh clf
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
strongly supports this legislation um
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I I'll be brief in my comments and
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh to avoid
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
repeating much of what's been said and
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I do have written comments that I'll
 
04:42:36.270 --> 04:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
I'll leave with the committee but um
 
04:42:39.390 --> 04:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to emphasize is uh that
 
04:42:41.788 --> 04:42:41.798 align:start position:0%
in the late n in the late
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
1990s the legislature
 
04:42:47.230 --> 04:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
adopted uh the statutory policy that's
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
been referenced which favors Source
 
04:42:53.190 --> 04:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
reduction as the number one way of
 
04:42:56.670 --> 04:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
managing solid waste it ranks recycling
 
04:42:59.708 --> 04:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
as number two composting as number three
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
landfilling as the least
 
04:43:06.750 --> 04:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
favorable uh roughly 25 years later we
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
have made little to no progress on
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
Source reduction and are not recycling
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
nearly enough and continue to rely on
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
landfilling and Disposal as the primary
 
04:43:22.990 --> 04:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
means and as you all know are seeing uh
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of that landfill capacity uh being
 
04:43:30.670 --> 04:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
filled by outof state waste so to to be
 
04:43:34.110 --> 04:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
successful on this issue the state needs
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
tools tools and epr
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
is absolutely a critical tool for
 
04:43:45.070 --> 04:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
reducing waste at the source and
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
avoiding the need for Unnecessary
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity unnecessary other
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
disposal capacity that harms communities
 
04:43:56.190 --> 04:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
and and the health of the people who
 
04:43:59.590 --> 04:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire so we strongly
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
support this bill um because it takes on
 
04:44:09.310 --> 04:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
Source reduction in a very important way
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
um there's been discussion of this but
 
04:44:15.510 --> 04:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know there is a cost associated with
 
04:44:18.628 --> 04:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
packaging waste someone bears that cost
 
04:44:20.910 --> 04:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
and right now it's primarily
 
04:44:23.788 --> 04:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities that bear that cost this
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
model shifts the costs to those who are
 
04:44:30.670 --> 04:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
producing the packaging and it and it
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
does so with a model that will
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
incentivize those produc producers to
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
reduce waste and to reduce the toxicity
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
of that waste um so I think that's
 
04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
really a critical element of this
 
04:44:48.270 --> 04:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
model I I would agree with director whim
 
04:44:50.670 --> 04:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
that that in a perfect world we should
 
04:44:53.350 --> 04:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
be able to wait for this to be addressed
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
on the national level or even the
 
04:44:58.910 --> 04:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
regional level um however we don't live
 
04:45:00.150 --> 04:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
in a perfect
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
world I I I think it's fair to say this
 
04:45:06.868 --> 04:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
will not be Ted tackled on the national
 
04:45:06.878 --> 04:45:08.708 align:start position:0%
will not be Ted tackled on the national
scale

04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
scale
 
04:45:11.230 --> 04:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think we can afford to
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
wait for this to happen on the regional
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
scale uh we state of Maine has stepped
 
04:45:18.350 --> 04:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
out is
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
leading while we wait for the rest of
 
04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
the region to address this
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
issue the rest of the region is sending
 
04:45:27.628 --> 04:45:27.638 align:start position:0%
their waste to New
 
04:45:30.750 --> 04:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so New Hampshire needs to step
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
up and lead on this issue if we we are
 
04:45:37.230 --> 04:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
going to work our way out of the cycle
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're in right now which is
 
04:45:42.270 --> 04:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately to have become The Dumping
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
Ground for much of the region with 50%
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
of our landfill capacity now going to
 
04:45:52.110 --> 04:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
outof State waste so this is a real
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
solution uh we strongly support it and
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
we hope you we hope the committee will
 
04:45:57.680 --> 04:45:58.990 align:start position:0%
we hope you we hope the committee will
as

04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
well representative Murray thank you
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you Mr for
 
04:46:07.110 --> 04:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it was mentioned
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I know you've probably poured over
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
the the legislation too um some
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
incentivizing of Industries to move away
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
from uh copious amounts of packaging and
 
04:46:20.670 --> 04:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
things like that um what I have seen a
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
few models within the state that are
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
starting to emerge around zero waste or
 
04:46:28.030 --> 04:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh bulk stores that you can go and
 
04:46:30.430 --> 04:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
refill things independently and I am
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
encouraged to see that um additionally I
 
04:46:34.670 --> 04:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
I I did have the conversation I think
 
04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor asking about
 
04:46:39.590 --> 04:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
recapturing um which we know exists with
 
04:46:41.548 --> 04:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
things like um plastic grocery store
 
04:46:44.590 --> 04:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
bags which it's not enough um that's
 
04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
just one form of packaging but um what
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
what other programs do you think we can
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
stand up within uh within that vein to
 
04:47:00.190 --> 04:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
also address the recapture side of
 
04:47:03.030 --> 04:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
recycling meaning with this model with
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
these funds what other types of
 
04:47:07.030 --> 04:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
recycling programs could be stood up um
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
well I think to representative bixby's
 
04:47:11.628 --> 04:47:11.638 align:start position:0%
point I think uh the the model would
 
04:47:15.070 --> 04:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
generate revenues that would allow for
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
um recycling infrastructure and and
 
04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
programs that uh could address perhaps
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh recyclables that really aren't being
 
04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
accommodated as well right now um but I
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
um I will tell you I'm pinch hit I'm
 
04:47:35.070 --> 04:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
pinch hitting today
 
04:47:37.990 --> 04:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
um our lead Advocate on this issue is
 
04:47:42.708 --> 04:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
out of the country um so I I don't
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
have I don't have concrete ideas as
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
to other types of recycling programs we
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
might see um but clearly it it would
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
create the path for more Recycling and
 
04:47:59.030 --> 04:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
just as importantly if not more
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
importantly create the path for Source
 
04:48:03.040 --> 04:48:05.830 align:start position:0%
importantly create the path for Source
reduction

04:48:05.830 --> 04:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so um I asked a
 
04:48:10.830 --> 04:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
similar question to director rimsad I'm
 
04:48:14.548 --> 04:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
I'm one just in terms of ways of getting
 
04:48:18.910 --> 04:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
to epr for packaging do you see the uh
 
04:48:22.110 --> 04:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
the model of a private sector um
 
04:48:26.270 --> 04:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
packaging reduction organization uh as a
 
04:48:30.110 --> 04:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh is that is that the ideal model for
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
um for trying to do this sort of
 
04:48:33.000 --> 04:48:35.270 align:start position:0%
um for trying to do this sort of
epr

04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
epr
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby I I don't know I
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
would defer to representative parall and
 
04:48:42.548 --> 04:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
the committee that has spent a lot of
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
time to on this personally because I
 
04:48:48.070 --> 04:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
have not um and as I mentioned our lead
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
Advocate on this who who has spent quite
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
a bit of time on this uh I'm sure she
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
would have an opinion but I I don't know
 
04:48:59.708 --> 04:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
what the other models are uh but I I
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
commend representative parall for the
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtful approach that he's taken in
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
developing this legislation and it uh it
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
it certainly seems like a model that
 
04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:17.788 --> 04:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
work thank you so I have a question for
 
04:49:17.798 --> 04:49:21.030 align:start position:0%
work thank you so I have a question for
you

04:49:21.030 --> 04:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
um representative kraton mentioned
 
04:49:26.670 --> 04:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
earlier uh had a question posed a
 
04:49:29.070 --> 04:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
question to representative Parell
 
04:49:32.548 --> 04:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
about uh increased costs that may come
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
to the consumer and as a result of
 
04:49:37.868 --> 04:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
implementation of this kind of program
 
04:49:39.868 --> 04:49:39.878 align:start position:0%
because we all know that businesses
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
whatever costs are borne by them um
 
04:49:47.150 --> 04:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately show up in the price of their
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
product if the price of products rise
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
and you know there was a statement by
 
04:49:59.150 --> 04:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative parall saying that those
 
04:50:04.470 --> 04:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh PR price price in um inflation May
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
be very
 
04:50:09.708 --> 04:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
negligible but still prices would go up
 
04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
if there were costs that would be borne
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
by the consumer and I'm concerned about
 
04:50:17.470 --> 04:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
how that might affect lower income
 
04:50:17.480 --> 04:50:19.390 align:start position:0%
how that might affect lower income
people

04:50:19.390 --> 04:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:50:21.548 --> 04:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
specifically um I'd like to get what
 
04:50:23.150 --> 04:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are on
 
04:50:25.708 --> 04:50:25.718 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Madam
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
chair um I think uh as as representative
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
parall paral mentioned you know we're we
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
we too are aware of a Canadian study
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
which indicated negligible impact
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
um I think there is the the cost
 
04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
savings aspect of this in that uh on the
 
04:50:52.548 --> 04:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
backside in terms of disposal consumers
 
04:50:56.430 --> 04:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
will not be paying um in terms of at the
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
point of
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
purchase uh that at that transaction
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
level um yeah as mentioned in Canada the
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
where epr has been implemented uh the
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
finding was the impacts were negligible
 
04:51:14.230 --> 04:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
and I'll just circle back to what I
 
04:51:16.548 --> 04:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
referenced uh what I mentioned earlier
 
04:51:20.310 --> 04:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
which is the incentive based
 
04:51:23.350 --> 04:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
model the the the the Bill calls for
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
Dees to engage in rul making to
 
04:51:28.510 --> 04:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
establish the fee structure a fee
 
04:51:31.470 --> 04:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:33.948 --> 04:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
incentivizes less packaging and less
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
toxic packaging can also result in a
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
cost savings
 
04:51:42.750 --> 04:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
for the The Producers meaning the the
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
packaging they ultimately produce uh May
 
04:51:48.868 --> 04:51:48.878 align:start position:0%
cost less than what they are producing
 
04:51:50.910 --> 04:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
before the
 
04:51:53.868 --> 04:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
program representative ger thank you
 
04:51:55.470 --> 04:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I I wanted to to follow
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
up on that because there was this
 
04:51:59.868 --> 04:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
question about if it was a negligible a
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
cost that gets handed off to the
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
consumer I don't know how like how in
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
the weeds you are in that Canadian study
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
the the the letter that weed from Nora
 
04:52:11.230 --> 04:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
your colleague Nora Bosworth says that
 
04:52:12.590 --> 04:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
correlation between cost and epr uh
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
policies in those provinces uh so again
 
04:52:22.510 --> 04:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you could speak to that
 
04:52:24.030 --> 04:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
more in terms of what the study actually
 
04:52:26.350 --> 04:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
says how familiar you are familiar you
 
04:52:27.868 --> 04:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
are with the study but the committee did
 
04:52:30.548 --> 04:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
receive that letter from Nora Bosworth
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
and the language that's used in that
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
letter is that the study concluded that
 
04:52:36.910 --> 04:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
there was no correlation between epr
 
04:52:39.628 --> 04:52:39.638 align:start position:0%
policies and increased cost for
 
04:52:42.190 --> 04:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
consumers I I have no further
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
information representative gerana to to
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
share with the committee about that
 
04:52:49.830 --> 04:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
study um but um you know we would
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
certainly be happy to follow up um when
 
04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
my colleague is available and she's the
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
one who has spent time drilling down
 
04:53:00.750 --> 04:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
into these issues representative Howard
 
04:53:04.350 --> 04:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
you had a question um I it it seems like
 
04:53:07.030 --> 04:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
it must be key to um have reduced
 
04:53:09.110 --> 04:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
packaging for the key for the success of
 
04:53:10.470 --> 04:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
this program to have the package be
 
04:53:12.830 --> 04:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
reduced would there be an accompanying
 
04:53:16.590 --> 04:53:16.600 align:start position:0%
trigger of Technology um to go with
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
that to you know to sort of to react to
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
the the differences in packaging
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative I I I think
 
04:53:28.548 --> 04:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's fair to say that this very
 
04:53:31.030 --> 04:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
well could trigger new technologies uh
 
04:53:32.830 --> 04:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
we're seeing techn you know we're seeing
 
04:53:35.110 --> 04:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
new business businesses now I I believe
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's one in Maine that is developing
 
04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
fiber B fiber-based packaging as a
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
replacement for plastic packaging uh so
 
04:53:46.030 --> 04:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
yes I I I would think this very well
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
trigger okay any other questions from
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Murray um
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um would it be
 
04:53:58.830 --> 04:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
fair to say that um the word cost is
 
04:54:01.628 --> 04:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
also could be C like uh categorized as
 
04:54:04.670 --> 04:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
being an environmental cost as well as a
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
a fiscal
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
cost yes thank you for that question
 
04:54:10.030 --> 04:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I I I think when
 
04:54:11.310 --> 04:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
we talk about
 
04:54:11.320 --> 04:54:13.150 align:start position:0%
we talk about
costs

04:54:13.150 --> 04:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:54:16.350 --> 04:54:16.360 align:start position:0%
uh we really should be viewing costs
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
more expansively there are health health
 
04:54:22.590 --> 04:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
related costs healthcare related costs
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
their impacts on property values um all
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
associated with the disposal industry um
 
04:54:34.310 --> 04:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know we have trucks
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
bringing waste uh from out of state and
 
04:54:39.990 --> 04:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
and traveling across the state to
 
04:54:40.000 --> 04:54:40.868 align:start position:0%
and traveling across the state to
certain

04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:54:43.708 --> 04:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
communities um to dispose of waste there
 
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
are costs that come with that and so I
 
04:54:50.190 --> 04:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
think if if you look at the if you
 
04:54:52.190 --> 04:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
consider costs more
 
04:54:55.548 --> 04:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
expansively then uh it's all the more
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
reason why we should be focused on and
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
be providing uh the tools for Source
 
04:55:05.070 --> 04:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
reduction so that we can break that
 
04:55:07.230 --> 04:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
cycle and and move away from where we
 
04:55:10.590 --> 04:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
are now which is primarily disposing of
 
04:55:10.600 --> 04:55:12.708 align:start position:0%
are now which is primarily disposing of
our

04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
waste any other
 
04:55:17.470 --> 04:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:55:20.350 --> 04:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon thank you I'd
 
04:55:22.110 --> 04:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
like to Now call Representative Jake
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.400 --> 04:55:35.310 align:start position:0%
 
testify

04:55:35.310 --> 04:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
testify
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and fellow
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee members uh I want to first
 
04:55:40.750 --> 04:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
start off by saying I agree with the
 
04:55:45.310 --> 04:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
overall premise of the bill to uh reduce
 
04:55:49.868 --> 04:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
um Source waste and to lessen the burden
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh the financial burden that
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities face I don't think anyone
 
04:55:55.150 --> 04:55:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's anyone that wouldn't agree
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
with that uh so I was part of this uh
 
04:56:01.548 --> 04:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
study committee that was charged with
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of looking at
 
04:56:05.430 --> 04:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
extended producer
 
04:56:07.788 --> 04:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh myself as well as uh
 
04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative Davis uh and we were both
 
04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
on the minority side of uh having
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislation put through uh regarding
 
04:56:20.350 --> 04:56:20.360 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility I just
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to briefly go over uh my Minority
 
04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
Report if you allow which I believe the
 
04:56:30.030 --> 04:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh members uh do have copies
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
of right well we want to make sure that
 
04:56:38.390 --> 04:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
we um that you are addressing the bill
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
itself um and what your objections are
 
04:56:45.670 --> 04:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
to specific parts of this bill um we
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
have the study committee report and I do
 
04:56:49.708 --> 04:56:49.718 align:start position:0%
hope that members of the committee have
 
04:56:53.430 --> 04:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
read it or plan to read it because um
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
there are some very Salient points that
 
04:56:59.150 --> 04:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
are made uh so if you could keep your
 
04:57:01.948 --> 04:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
comments to this particular piece of
 
04:57:05.430 --> 04:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and perhaps parts of it that
 
04:57:09.670 --> 04:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
you feel maybe are not workable or uh
 
04:57:11.910 --> 04:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
any other objections to the bill but
 
04:57:14.150 --> 04:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
please speak to the bill and not
 
04:57:17.868 --> 04:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily rehash what you went over
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
committee so as as it was admitted here
 
04:57:27.958 --> 04:57:30.670 align:start position:0%
committee so as as it was admitted here
in

04:57:30.670 --> 04:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:34.110 --> 04:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
testimony we have little evidence one
 
04:57:37.310 --> 04:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
study outof country study Canadian study
 
04:57:39.548 --> 04:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
that suggested there would be no C added
 
04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
cost to the
 
04:57:42.910 --> 04:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
consumer we don't even know if it works
 
04:57:44.948 --> 04:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
in other
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
states to suggest that a
 
04:57:52.230 --> 04:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
four 4 Day
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
committee study period would be
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient to have this bill go through
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
I believe is is
 
04:58:04.110 --> 04:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
ludicrous uh and to suggest that no
 
04:58:07.548 --> 04:58:07.558 align:start position:0%
negative economic impact to the state
 
04:58:07.558 --> 04:58:08.510 align:start position:0%
negative economic impact to the state
would

04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:58:11.948 --> 04:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
happen uh but we need to rush
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
legislation through because the time the
 
04:58:15.868 --> 04:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
clock's ticking we don't have enough
 
04:58:19.350 --> 04:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
time um we could potentially P be
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
passing a bad Bill through to achieve
 
04:58:24.910 --> 04:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
said goals when there are other meth
 
04:58:27.310 --> 04:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
methods uh that can go about about the
 
04:58:30.030 --> 04:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
same way um it was brought up that
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
education awareness program be
 
04:58:34.750 --> 04:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
implemented to let the consumer know
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
that hey there may be there are other
 
04:58:40.270 --> 04:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
choices that would put a less of a
 
04:58:44.430 --> 04:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
economic uh environmental impact uh was
 
04:58:45.590 --> 04:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
regarding packaging that you can
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
purchase instead of buying a plastic mil
 
04:58:49.548 --> 04:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
C and you can buy a cardboard one
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
instead of buying a plastic egg carton
 
04:58:54.470 --> 04:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
you can buy the cardboard uh one or you
 
04:58:56.590 --> 04:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
know raise chickens on yourself instead
 
04:58:59.510 --> 04:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
of buying you know bulk water
 
04:59:03.270 --> 04:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
bottles um in bulk you could use a
 
04:59:05.350 --> 04:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
reusable water
 
04:59:08.430 --> 04:59:08.440 align:start position:0%
jug you know using recyclable plastic
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
bags when you do your shopping there are
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
other methods uh to go about uh as far
 
04:59:16.270 --> 04:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
as in order to achieve the same goals
 
04:59:20.190 --> 04:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
another method was to uh utilize the
 
04:59:22.868 --> 04:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
recycling bill that was passed
 
04:59:25.230 --> 04:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
SB let's
 
04:59:28.390 --> 04:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
see uh that was passed into
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
law is that s SP 367 yes SB 367 which
 
04:59:36.590 --> 04:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
utilizes the new plastic recycling tech
 
04:59:39.548 --> 04:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
technology having businesses take
 
04:59:42.788 --> 04:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
advantage of that to again reduce the
 
04:59:45.788 --> 04:59:45.798 align:start position:0%
toxic uh impact in the environment and
 
04:59:49.070 --> 04:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
to again overall uh lessen the the
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:58.990 --> 04:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
well no no
 
05:00:01.070 --> 05:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
actual because this this does relate to
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I have to bring it up no actual
 
05:00:05.670 --> 05:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
State statutes were analyzed in our
 
05:00:09.470 --> 05:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
study committee to to justify this bill
 
05:00:12.310 --> 05:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't look at Main statute
 
05:00:15.390 --> 05:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
number dot dot dot here's the statute we
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
didn't look at California law dot dot
 
05:00:21.310 --> 05:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
dot here's a statute we didn't we we
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
didn't even delve into those programs to
 
05:00:26.350 --> 05:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
see how it how it could relate to the
 
05:00:30.350 --> 05:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
state and it'll be beneficial for us uh
 
05:00:32.590 --> 05:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
most of the stakeholder analysis that we
 
05:00:32.600 --> 05:00:33.510 align:start position:0%
most of the stakeholder analysis that we
got

05:00:33.510 --> 05:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
got
 
05:00:36.190 --> 05:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
was on the last day of the committee
 
05:00:39.230 --> 05:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
hearings where from concerned uh
 
05:00:40.990 --> 05:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
citizens regarding the environmental
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
impacts of landfills versus um one of
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
the main objectives was the municipality
 
05:00:52.948 --> 05:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
costs uh again there there are other
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
methods to to go about achieving the
 
05:00:56.390 --> 05:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
same goals whether you look at out of
 
05:00:58.430 --> 05:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
state trash you look at other
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
Technologies waste of energy other
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
disposal Technologies education
 
05:01:06.030 --> 05:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh I believe we can achieve the same
 
05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
goals that's desired may I ask um I
 
05:01:13.150 --> 05:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
don't mean to interrupt but were were
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
there any people from uh companies that
 
05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
create packaging or companies that um
 
05:01:25.548 --> 05:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
use packaging
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
or did anybody who who who might have
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
come to your uh study committee to talk
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
about how they deal with their packaging
 
05:01:37.590 --> 05:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
the main one uh I believe the the only
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
one was the American Beverage
 
05:01:43.990 --> 05:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
Association um that they were
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the overall premise
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
um of the bill but they were uh
 
05:01:58.190 --> 05:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
is they weren't exactly
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh agreed they weren't exactly in
 
05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
agreement about the uh methodology uh to
 
05:02:06.548 --> 05:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
go about the uh reaching that achieving
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
that those
 
05:02:11.070 --> 05:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
goals um I think in in our study
 
05:02:13.390 --> 05:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative uh or
 
05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
Senator I should say Ad Schiller agreed
 
05:02:17.948 --> 05:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
with the overall uh premise that the
 
05:02:20.750 --> 05:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
that the uh cost would be passed on to
 
05:02:23.670 --> 05:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
the consumer that the manufacturer
 
05:02:26.788 --> 05:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
producer would not eat the cost the fee
 
05:02:28.350 --> 05:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly out of the just the good
 
05:02:32.270 --> 05:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
nature of their their heart um we talked
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
about leveling the playing field I I
 
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
believe the playing field will certainly
 
05:02:36.040 --> 05:02:37.190 align:start position:0%
believe the playing field will certainly
be

05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:02:40.270 --> 05:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
leveled when the mom and pop the more
 
05:02:40.280 --> 05:02:41.628 align:start position:0%
leveled when the mom and pop the more
independent

05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
independent
 
05:02:44.830 --> 05:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
businesses will be taking on these
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
fees and not being able to do so because
 
05:02:49.510 --> 05:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
they don't produce in Mass quantity like
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
some of these other bigger
 
05:02:53.270 --> 05:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
corporations uh and so I believe that
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
will certainly level the playing field
 
05:03:00.270 --> 05:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.190 --> 05:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
maybe harder harder for them to
 
05:03:05.788 --> 05:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.430 --> 05:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
produce questions from representative
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um thank
 
05:03:12.110 --> 05:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
question um I guess um with regard to
 
05:03:18.948 --> 05:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
the bill um we had talked about the
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
ability to level the playing field by
 
05:03:22.548 --> 05:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
creating some offsets for smaller
 
05:03:25.628 --> 05:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
companies and a carve outs um I think
 
05:03:28.190 --> 05:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
that were enumerated in the earlier uh
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative earlier in the bill
 
05:03:34.948 --> 05:03:34.958 align:start position:0%
um page five yes thank you thank you I
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
page five um section V yeah V uh lines
 
05:03:43.590 --> 05:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
13 through 17 in the bill and I just was
 
05:03:46.150 --> 05:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
curious to know whether or not um you
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
felt that those were sufficient
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative or if you had other ideas
 
05:03:55.548 --> 05:03:55.558 align:start position:0%
and how um those offsets might impact
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.600 --> 05:04:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
businesses

05:04:04.230 --> 05:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:04:06.310 --> 05:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
the the study
 
05:04:08.830 --> 05:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee we did not have nearly
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of time to review the
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh in the study committee a lot of
 
05:04:17.470 --> 05:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
it seemed like the typ typical model
 
05:04:19.990 --> 05:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislation uh that it may have been
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
drafted outside of the um outside of the
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
state and not related to um something
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
that a state
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislator or a multiple state
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
legislators would come up
 
05:04:37.070 --> 05:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
with uh what what section exactly were
 
05:04:39.788 --> 05:04:39.798 align:start position:0%
you looking yes yes thank Madam chair
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
may I yes sure it's page five lines uh
 
05:04:50.548 --> 05:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:52.590 --> 05:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
17 and that's really the area of
 
05:04:54.548 --> 05:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
question that I was having uh sort of
 
05:04:58.230 --> 05:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
question about help to smaller in uh
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:10.110 align:start position:0%
 
state

05:05:10.110 --> 05:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.120 --> 05:05:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:18.030 --> 05:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
next it it may or may not help depending
 
05:05:19.948 --> 05:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
on what type of producer you are
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
depending on what type of business you
 
05:05:21.760 --> 05:05:26.070 align:start position:0%
depending on what type of business you
have

05:05:26.070 --> 05:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of companies they're
 
05:05:33.390 --> 05:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
already going to a
 
05:05:35.910 --> 05:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh more environmentally friendly
 
05:05:37.990 --> 05:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
packaging they're using less materials
 
05:05:39.708 --> 05:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
in their packaging because it's it's one
 
05:05:42.830 --> 05:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
is cheaper they're already using a lot
 
05:05:44.150 --> 05:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
of recycled
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
Plastics uh and so the echo
 
05:05:50.830 --> 05:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
modulation I don't I don't believe that
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial when a lot of
 
05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.948 --> 05:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
route okay representative German you had
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
a question and then I'll get down to you
 
05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much Madam chair so
 
05:06:09.390 --> 05:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
with the discussion about which I am
 
05:06:10.830 --> 05:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
entirely in favor of trying to do a
 
05:06:12.190 --> 05:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
better job of kind of educating
 
05:06:13.990 --> 05:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
consumers educating the public at large
 
05:06:16.990 --> 05:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
to make better better choices um I I
 
05:06:19.948 --> 05:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
hear that and often those educational
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
programs lack the resources they need I
 
05:06:23.470 --> 05:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
think to be as effective as they could
 
05:06:25.830 --> 05:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
be but when again looking at our our
 
05:06:29.070 --> 05:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
bial Solid Waste report uh that that we
 
05:06:30.990 --> 05:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
just was published at the end of last
 
05:06:33.390 --> 05:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
year we've seen that even with all of
 
05:06:35.990 --> 05:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
the education around recycling maybe
 
05:06:37.070 --> 05:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's not as good as it could be but
 
05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Education around
 
05:06:41.270 --> 05:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
recycling we have seen no appreciable
 
05:06:43.750 --> 05:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
increase in our recycling rate in this
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
state it's between 20 and 25% and it has
 
05:06:48.628 --> 05:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
been for more than five years that
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me to suggest that a
 
05:06:53.270 --> 05:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the shortfall in
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
terms of our waste reduction plan that
 
05:06:57.788 --> 05:06:57.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't suggest to me that an education
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
a public education policy is going to
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
make any
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
meaningful uh difference in people's
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
consumption uh habits so what I'm
 
05:07:07.628 --> 05:07:07.638 align:start position:0%
wondering is and this is a genuine
 
05:07:09.270 --> 05:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
question it's not meant as a gy question
 
05:07:12.270 --> 05:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
or anything like that like based on that
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
what evidence do you have that suggests
 
05:07:17.110 --> 05:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
even the most robust education campaign
 
05:07:19.310 --> 05:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
is going to have a significant effect on
 
05:07:21.670 --> 05:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
consumer Behavior again I don't I don't
 
05:07:23.830 --> 05:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
believe it's the sole tactic I mean I
 
05:07:26.270 --> 05:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't I I haven't seen enough awareness
 
05:07:29.470 --> 05:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
in my town uh Nottingham uh I believe
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
there are other tactics involved to
 
05:07:33.230 --> 05:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
achieve this the same goals again
 
05:07:36.590 --> 05:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the recycling law that was um
 
05:07:38.990 --> 05:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
from house uh Senate Bill
 
05:07:43.548 --> 05:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
367 I believe it was uh to um you know
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
reap the benefits of that recycling
 
05:07:47.230 --> 05:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
technology have businesses coming in and
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
and and reap those benefits uh again we
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
can we can look at out ofate waste and
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
see if there's any ways or by means of
 
05:07:58.150 --> 05:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
diverting some of that waste having it
 
05:08:01.788 --> 05:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
go to uh waste to energy trying to limit
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
limit that I don't think we've we've
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
really looked at that aspect enough
 
05:08:05.558 --> 05:08:06.788 align:start position:0%
really looked at that aspect enough
where

05:08:06.788 --> 05:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:08:11.110 --> 05:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
we and I think a lot of um a lot of
 
05:08:13.230 --> 05:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
state legislators would say they would
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
agree that we have a significant amount
 
05:08:18.830 --> 05:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
of waste coming into the state
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh you we would have to find some way uh
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
around the Commerce Clause because you
 
05:08:27.430 --> 05:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
do have to allow for a free flow of uh
 
05:08:29.030 --> 05:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
commerce between
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
states so but again the overall idea
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to rush something through
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh where we don't know if it's going to
 
05:08:39.868 --> 05:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for our state is I just
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
can't see
 
05:08:45.628 --> 05:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
um me me me supporting something like
 
05:08:48.948 --> 05:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
this representative NAB and then thank
 
05:08:50.430 --> 05:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you representative
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
for testifying today um you mentioned
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of time your committee had a
 
05:08:56.070 --> 05:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
few times but I wonder do you think if
 
05:08:57.150 --> 05:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
you had had more time you would have
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
gotten to a better bill or do you not
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
believe in epr in
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:03.590 align:start position:0%
believe in epr in
general

05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
general
 
05:09:06.270 --> 05:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
I think I think both uh is true I think
 
05:09:07.708 --> 05:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
you would need a
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
significant uh amount of
 
05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
time to study this
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
when as as director whimet had mentioned
 
05:09:18.030 --> 05:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
that you know laws was passed a few I
 
05:09:19.868 --> 05:09:19.878 align:start position:0%
think a few years ago in Maine and
 
05:09:21.390 --> 05:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
they're still trying to come up with
 
05:09:23.430 --> 05:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
rules and
 
05:09:27.470 --> 05:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
so is this a year-long
 
05:09:27.480 --> 05:09:30.070 align:start position:0%
so is this a year-long
study

05:09:30.070 --> 05:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:09:34.190 --> 05:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh committee uh issue or is multi-year I
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't give you that answer I
 
05:09:39.230 --> 05:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
just know having a 4-day committee
 
05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
meeting to to study this and looking
 
05:09:43.830 --> 05:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
this was not nearly enough time um
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
representative Marie you had a
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
question did thank you did your did you
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
have any data given to you or presented
 
05:09:54.510 --> 05:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
to you that might indicate that we have
 
05:09:56.590 --> 05:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
a larger infrastructure maybe that we're
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
not tapping into around um I I keep
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
going back to the concept of recapturing
 
05:10:03.310 --> 05:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
things like disposable razors for
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
example I know that you know people who
 
05:10:07.150 --> 05:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
shave there there are prepaid envelopes
 
05:10:09.390 --> 05:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
that can get mailed back to the producer
 
05:10:10.948 --> 05:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
so that those are not getting disposed
 
05:10:12.430 --> 05:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
of I know that there are businesses
 
05:10:15.110 --> 05:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
around the state that uh receive uh
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
double A and AAA batteries so that
 
05:10:18.350 --> 05:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
they're not going into landfills and
 
05:10:21.548 --> 05:10:21.558 align:start position:0%
getting tossed um so I'm curious to know
 
05:10:24.190 --> 05:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
if if there was any any more information
 
05:10:25.788 --> 05:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
presented to you about those recovery
 
05:10:29.310 --> 05:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
and recapture side of things as well I
 
05:10:31.628 --> 05:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
didn't see any I I mean I don't recall
 
05:10:36.590 --> 05:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh seeing any data uh to that effect um
 
05:10:38.788 --> 05:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
again I know there are other avenues we
 
05:10:40.910 --> 05:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
towns most towns or nearby towns have
 
05:10:42.830 --> 05:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
their household hazardous Way St where
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
they can save up their batteries they
 
05:10:46.948 --> 05:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
can save up their bulbs uh other
 
05:10:49.110 --> 05:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
potentially toxic material that they
 
05:10:55.510 --> 05:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
days represent
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
Bixby so um just just so you can uh find
 
05:11:03.070 --> 05:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
the reference I'm going to be making in
 
05:11:06.670 --> 05:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
a in as I get towards the core of my
 
05:11:09.150 --> 05:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
question um on page
 
05:11:13.230 --> 05:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
14 uh section uh starting at line um
 
05:11:18.390 --> 05:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
line seven so uh I was uh intimately
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
involved with the passage of H SB 367 a
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
couple years ago and one of the things
 
05:11:28.910 --> 05:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
that so one of the questions I asked the
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
industry was what's your incentive for
 
05:11:31.520 --> 05:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
industry was what's your incentive for
making

05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:11:37.628 --> 05:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
uh plastic out of recycled plastic that
 
05:11:39.430 --> 05:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
you needs to go through pyrolysis which
 
05:11:41.708 --> 05:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
is a very expensive process as opposed
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
to making it out of Virgin plastic and
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
what they said was that in some
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions they are required to
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
include a certain amount of postc
 
05:11:58.110 --> 05:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
consumer uh pla recycled plastic and for
 
05:12:01.470 --> 05:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh plastic that is in contact with food
 
05:12:04.270 --> 05:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
mechan iCal recycling is not sufficient
 
05:12:07.470 --> 05:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be chemically recycled
 
05:12:11.590 --> 05:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
and so uh do you think that uh the
 
05:12:15.750 --> 05:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
section in this bill that provides for a
 
05:12:19.990 --> 05:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh for a a minimum amounts of uh
 
05:12:23.270 --> 05:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
recycled plastic in containers would
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
provide a good incentive for advanced
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
recycling see I I don't even know if
 
05:12:33.830 --> 05:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's sensible Sensible because
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
you have certain plastic contain uh
 
05:12:38.830 --> 05:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
containers that need to be rigid that
 
05:12:42.670 --> 05:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
need to protect whatever product is in
 
05:12:45.070 --> 05:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
said packaging you need to have certain
 
05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
plastic packaging to prevent
 
05:12:47.920 --> 05:12:50.230 align:start position:0%
plastic packaging to prevent
cross-contamination

05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination
 
05:12:57.190 --> 05:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:00.270 --> 05:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
always efficient because you need it's
 
05:13:02.190 --> 05:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
it depends on what product is being
 
05:13:04.270 --> 05:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
placed in that
 
05:13:06.470 --> 05:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
packaging I think I I think I might not
 
05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
have been entirely clear okay uh
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
so uh the the rec the the plastic that
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
comes out of recycl advanced recycling
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
is essentially just like virgin plastic
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's made from the same chemical
 
05:13:25.270 --> 05:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
components as are extracted from
 
05:13:29.230 --> 05:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
petroleum or distilled petroleum and and
 
05:13:31.390 --> 05:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
so uh what it doesn't have is the
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
contain minants that might be in other
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
recycled plastic so that's what makes it
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
food safe and in terms of the rigidity
 
05:13:41.628 --> 05:13:41.638 align:start position:0%
well they it's basically like virgin
 
05:13:44.030 --> 05:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
plastic except it's coming from the more
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
expensive Advanced recycling process so
 
05:13:50.990 --> 05:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
their incentive was that jurisdictions
 
05:13:51.000 --> 05:13:52.430 align:start position:0%
their incentive was that jurisdictions
were

05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
05:13:55.310 --> 05:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
requiring uh a certain percentage of
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
recycled plastic in the food safe
 
05:14:00.910 --> 05:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
packaging and the only way they could
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
meet that was by using Advanced
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
Recycling and I'm wondering if you think
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
that what is in this bill would be an
 
05:14:13.070 --> 05:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate incentive for uh people who
 
05:14:16.430 --> 05:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
are trying to sell uh plastic containers
 
05:14:20.070 --> 05:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with food in them to uh
 
05:14:22.390 --> 05:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know to to make those package to
 
05:14:24.708 --> 05:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
make that packages using recycled
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:38.868 --> 05:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not a a advanced recycler um so I
 
05:14:41.030 --> 05:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
can't tell you more about the the type
 
05:14:43.390 --> 05:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
of product uh I just know that there are
 
05:14:47.230 --> 05:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
benefits in in using uh said product uh
 
05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
packaging um okay but I can't I can't
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
really delve into the specifics of
 
05:14:56.270 --> 05:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
it okay representative comat
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative bruland for taking my
 
05:15:00.600 --> 05:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
representative bruland for taking my
questions

05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:15:05.430 --> 05:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
I hear what you're saying about this
 
05:15:08.230 --> 05:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
bill and I do have my own concerns but
 
05:15:10.830 --> 05:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
what I am seeing nationally and globally
 
05:15:14.510 --> 05:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
is already a reduction in packaging for
 
05:15:16.230 --> 05:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
instance I don't know if you know this
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
but McDonald's by
 
05:15:22.190 --> 05:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
2025 will be 100% recyclable that is
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
their goal unor lever by 20 2025 they
 
05:15:30.270 --> 05:15:30.280 align:start position:0%
will have reduced the amount of their
 
05:15:34.670 --> 05:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
virgin plastic by more than a 100,000
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
tons I think right now the industry is
 
05:15:41.110 --> 05:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
already speaking and doing it on their
 
05:15:44.830 --> 05:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
own and if that is the case what is
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
necessary in this bill in your opinion
 
05:15:51.510 --> 05:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:55.750 --> 05:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
not well and just to
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
um just to re reiterate that I was I
 
05:16:01.150 --> 05:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
think I was looking at these solid waste
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
report and I think we had less waste per
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
tonnage in 2022 versus prior years with
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
with a an increased
 
05:16:16.590 --> 05:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
population and so as you said we're
 
05:16:18.708 --> 05:16:18.718 align:start position:0%
already we're already having uh
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
instances where organizations are
 
05:16:24.990 --> 05:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
looking to cut back um the amount of
 
05:16:29.868 --> 05:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
packaging um the amount of waste that's
 
05:16:34.030 --> 05:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.350 --> 05:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh being provided to the uh landfill and
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:16:38.958 --> 05:16:41.390 align:start position:0%
to the
environment

05:16:41.390 --> 05:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
environment
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh I mean I I don't know how much more I
 
05:16:47.948 --> 05:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
could say on on this bill but that that
 
05:16:50.310 --> 05:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
again I think the overall premise of the
 
05:16:52.548 --> 05:16:52.558 align:start position:0%
bill is I I agree with the overall
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
premise the methodology again I I do not
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
05:16:57.600 --> 05:16:59.230 align:start position:0%
agree with
when

05:16:59.230 --> 05:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:17:02.470 --> 05:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
a more study time is needed
 
05:17:05.830 --> 05:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
B we need to see what our neighboring
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
states uh the the final result of what
 
05:17:10.590 --> 05:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
our neor neighboring states have
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
then how that how their their program
 
05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
has help
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities we have a question from
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
representative kraton and then
 
05:17:22.558 --> 05:17:24.708 align:start position:0%
representative kraton and then
representative

05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
kulan and thank you for your your
 
05:17:30.350 --> 05:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and your patience uh I I think
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
I've heard ch two separate things I
 
05:17:35.070 --> 05:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could clarify the bill
 
05:17:38.030 --> 05:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we're considering right now that is
 
05:17:40.350 --> 05:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
not a result of the study committee it's
 
05:17:43.948 --> 05:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
a separate bill I believe this bill was
 
05:17:47.628 --> 05:17:47.638 align:start position:0%
was drafted and and given to us late in
 
05:17:49.510 --> 05:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
the in the study committee though this
 
05:17:51.548 --> 05:17:51.558 align:start position:0%
but it's not the study committee Bill no
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
correct correct yes yep all right thank
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
you representative kulon thank you madam
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative Brew
 
05:18:02.628 --> 05:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
yard for taking my question um
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
so I mean with respect to my colleagues
 
05:18:07.548 --> 05:18:07.558 align:start position:0%
and believe it or not I am actually
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about single use Plastics and
 
05:18:13.150 --> 05:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
things like this but I'm also really
 
05:18:16.030 --> 05:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
sensitive about the subject of Taxation
 
05:18:17.910 --> 05:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
and when I read this bill I can't help
 
05:18:20.470 --> 05:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
but think this is a really complicated
 
05:18:23.230 --> 05:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
tax on consumers in a time of pretty
 
05:18:26.990 --> 05:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
high inflationary rates I mean can you
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
convince me otherwise of that or what's
 
05:18:31.948 --> 05:18:31.958 align:start position:0%
your position on that
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
I think you have to look at the
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
cumulative um aspect of it where we we
 
05:18:40.548 --> 05:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
have high gas prices we have a higher
 
05:18:43.788 --> 05:18:43.798 align:start position:0%
cost of living uh
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
inflation uh and now with this uh a
 
05:18:48.750 --> 05:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
potential added
 
05:18:51.830 --> 05:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
tax I think it takes it takes a toll if
 
05:18:55.510 --> 05:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
you look at it in entirety um in it's
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
definitely just another added uh cost
 
05:19:00.628 --> 05:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
that the consumer will eventually have
 
05:19:02.948 --> 05:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
05:19:04.670 --> 05:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
05:19:07.470 --> 05:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
05:19:09.750 --> 05:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative brard we appreciate your
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
time and moving right along our next um
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
pink card is from Christina
 
05:19:21.868 --> 05:19:21.878 align:start position:0%
dubben um sorry I didn't mean to
 
05:19:23.350 --> 05:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
mispronounce your
 
05:19:23.360 --> 05:19:30.230 align:start position:0%
mispronounce your
name

05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:19:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair and members of
 
05:19:41.270 --> 05:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm G to completely go off
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
script here so hopefully I don't go
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't go too badly but I just want to
 
05:19:46.628 --> 05:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
show you because of all the questions
 
05:19:49.470 --> 05:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
coming up what is actually going to be
 
05:19:51.270 --> 05:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
incentivized what are producers going to
 
05:19:53.190 --> 05:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
be incentivized to do with their
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
packaging when such a law is passed
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
things like this right we have fiber
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
based exterior packaging this is how it
 
05:20:04.470 --> 05:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
came it was not in seven bubble wrap
 
05:20:07.150 --> 05:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
envelopes like we see these days from a
 
05:20:10.948 --> 05:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
certain large company um and then you
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
know here again more fiber based kind of
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
cushioning this is a fully recyclable
 
05:20:19.310 --> 05:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
aluminum bottle that can be refilled so
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
it can be shipped back and refilled or
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
it can be recycled in your curbside
 
05:20:27.150 --> 05:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
recycling bin recycled aluminum is great
 
05:20:30.110 --> 05:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
um something else that you may
 
05:20:33.670 --> 05:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
see getting the water out of products
 
05:20:36.270 --> 05:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
when you remove the liquid suddenly I
 
05:20:40.590 --> 05:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
don't need a giant red orange plastic
 
05:20:42.910 --> 05:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
container sitting on top of my laundry
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
um washer right I can you know have
 
05:20:48.670 --> 05:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
something like this um much easier much
 
05:20:50.110 --> 05:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
lighter to
 
05:20:53.390 --> 05:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
ship um you know and then I'll give give
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
you one more example this is a glass
 
05:21:00.070 --> 05:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
bottle with a a metal top you pour this
 
05:21:01.948 --> 05:21:01.958 align:start position:0%
into a larger glass bottle you fill it
 
05:21:03.990 --> 05:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
with water at home and now you you get
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
to your cleaning so these are just some
 
05:21:09.150 --> 05:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
examples of what we'll see more of and
 
05:21:10.910 --> 05:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
some things not packaged at all for
 
05:21:12.750 --> 05:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
instance like soap that you you know
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
don't need the
 
05:21:17.948 --> 05:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
packaging deposit uh container container
 
05:21:21.390 --> 05:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
deposit systems uh DRS otherwise known
 
05:21:23.390 --> 05:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
as bottle bills kind of a dirty word
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
nowadays um that's the oldest one of the
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
oldest forms and proven forms of
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility bit of
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
a different system but it is a form of
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility so we
 
05:21:35.948 --> 05:21:35.958 align:start position:0%
do have proven models in the United
 
05:21:38.548 --> 05:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
States in addition to the four laws that
 
05:21:41.030 --> 05:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
have passed that you've heard about um
 
05:21:44.430 --> 05:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
one really important part of an epr for
 
05:21:47.350 --> 05:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
packaging law or bill is the needs
 
05:21:50.070 --> 05:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
assessment you can look at Maryland who
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
just passed um they were looking at an
 
05:21:54.548 --> 05:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
epr for packaging bill they decided to
 
05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
pass the needs assessment portion um so
 
05:22:00.590 --> 05:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
that they could really look at how many
 
05:22:02.948 --> 05:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
staff do they actually need to add what
 
05:22:05.030 --> 05:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
does their waste stream really you know
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
look like what are the what are the
 
05:22:07.788 --> 05:22:07.798 align:start position:0%
needs right so that's a really really
 
05:22:11.548 --> 05:22:11.558 align:start position:0%
important part of um this legislation in
 
05:22:13.628 --> 05:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
recycling so there's these Ecom
 
05:22:17.310 --> 05:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
modulated fees producers are
 
05:22:19.590 --> 05:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
incentivized to make better material
 
05:22:22.030 --> 05:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
choices this is going to clean up our
 
05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
streams right that yields better bail
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
prices when you don't have all this
 
05:22:29.310 --> 05:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
contamination plastic all these
 
05:22:32.150 --> 05:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
multi-layered Packaging those are not
 
05:22:35.548 --> 05:22:35.558 align:start position:0%
recyclable mailback programs like
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
terracycle there's you know you can go
 
05:22:40.190 --> 05:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
ahead and Google it they're being found
 
05:22:42.670 --> 05:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
to be false Solutions these items are
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
not actually getting recycled less than
 
05:22:49.948 --> 05:22:49.958 align:start position:0%
6% of all Plastics are recycled less
 
05:22:49.958 --> 05:22:51.150 align:start position:0%
6% of all Plastics are recycled less
than

05:22:51.150 --> 05:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
6% recycling is awesome for aluminum and
 
05:22:58.230 --> 05:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
for glass and for paper and cardboard it
 
05:23:00.628 --> 05:23:00.638 align:start position:0%
is not a good solution for Plastics
 
05:23:00.638 --> 05:23:01.430 align:start position:0%
is not a good solution for Plastics
which

05:23:01.430 --> 05:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
40 so 30% of the waist stream is
 
05:23:08.390 --> 05:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
packaging 40% of packaging is single-use
 
05:23:11.948 --> 05:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
plastic so that is a major um thing here
 
05:23:14.830 --> 05:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
also recycled plastic has been found to
 
05:23:18.190 --> 05:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
be more toxic than virgin plastic when
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
you recycle plastic uh mechanically you
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
have to add virgin plastic you have the
 
05:23:27.190 --> 05:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
chemicals that came already in there
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
right to give it its rigidity and its
 
05:23:31.030 --> 05:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
color and other properties now now
 
05:23:34.270 --> 05:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to add more chemicals to do
 
05:23:36.310 --> 05:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
what you want with the new application
 
05:23:38.190 --> 05:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
plastic can only be recycled a few times
 
05:23:40.110 --> 05:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
mechanically because it loses its
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
Integrity so again there vast
 
05:23:45.430 --> 05:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
limitations um check out the consumer
 
05:23:49.070 --> 05:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
reports issue from last week about food
 
05:23:53.628 --> 05:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
packaging Bates bisphenols in all sorts
 
05:23:56.110 --> 05:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
of foods packaged foods and fast foods
 
05:23:59.390 --> 05:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
um that I'm sure in all of our homes so
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
I I'll leave that there it's a major
 
05:24:02.190 --> 05:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
public health issue we're talking about
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
costs Health costs
 
05:24:08.190 --> 05:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
um in terms of we are seeing
 
05:24:10.030 --> 05:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
corporations standing up and making
 
05:24:13.110 --> 05:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
these pledges we want to hold producers
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
accountable in statute because we see
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
these voluntary pledges again and again
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
they are not met so they come out with
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
them and then 10 year you know however
 
05:24:24.110 --> 05:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
many years down the road oh well we
 
05:24:25.868 --> 05:24:25.878 align:start position:0%
tried and you know we got we got this
 
05:24:27.830 --> 05:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
far so I will say be careful about that
 
05:24:31.470 --> 05:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
but yes the you know reduction is the
 
05:24:34.150 --> 05:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
key word here um and that's what this
 
05:24:36.910 --> 05:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
this policy seeks to do I will also note
 
05:24:40.628 --> 05:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
that um hb1 1630 serves all eight goals
 
05:24:42.868 --> 05:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
of the 2022 New Hampshire Solid Waste
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
Management plan um by obviously reducing
 
05:24:47.788 --> 05:24:47.798 align:start position:0%
the quantity of the solid waste getting
 
05:24:51.110 --> 05:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
the toxicity out of the waste stream um
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know ensuring adequate capacity for
 
05:24:55.110 --> 05:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
the management of New Hampshire
 
05:24:57.510 --> 05:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
generated waste right 50% nearly of our
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
waste is coming from out of state this
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
addresses that
 
05:25:05.708 --> 05:25:05.718 align:start position:0%
frankly um so I I did not fully identify
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
myself I realized I just sat down hat at
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
it so I am um uh my I have many
 
05:25:13.510 --> 05:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
different roles today I'm here um as the
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer campaigns coordinator for the
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
surf riter Foundation New Hampshire
 
05:25:19.628 --> 05:25:19.638 align:start position:0%
chapter um and we do strongly support
 
05:25:22.708 --> 05:25:22.718 align:start position:0%
this bill uh for all the reasons that I
 
05:25:25.708 --> 05:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I think I'm gonna stop
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
there I will say one more thing there is
 
05:25:29.230 --> 05:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
a bill in play right now in New York
 
05:25:31.670 --> 05:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
Senator Pete harkam um an assembly
 
05:25:35.430 --> 05:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
member Deborah Glick um it's moved along
 
05:25:37.390 --> 05:25:37.400 align:start position:0%
pretty far um so I would take a look at
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
that as in addition to the needs
 
05:25:42.030 --> 05:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
assessment uh process in Maryland and
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that thank you for your
 
05:25:46.110 --> 05:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
testimony and I thank you for the uh
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
visual aids too because um I know
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
personally when I am getting items in
 
05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
the mail I have seen definitely you know
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
not seeing as much bubble wrap anymore
 
05:25:59.910 --> 05:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing a lot more paper wrap I'm
 
05:26:04.310 --> 05:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot more more um paper instead
 
05:26:04.320 --> 05:26:05.190 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot more more um paper instead
of

05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
plastics so and to representative ktoa
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
point before we see a lot more of these
 
05:26:14.990 --> 05:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
companies moving to these
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
items which begs the question why then
 
05:26:21.390 --> 05:26:21.400 align:start position:0%
would we have to do something
 
05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
statutorily to deal with that I mean I
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
remember I'm old enough to remember that
 
05:26:29.310 --> 05:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
um you know when things used to come in
 
05:26:32.230 --> 05:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
paper all the time mhm and then
 
05:26:34.510 --> 05:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
everybody wanted to save the trees so
 
05:26:37.708 --> 05:26:37.718 align:start position:0%
what we ended up with was now Plastics
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
and plastic packaging and that became
 
05:26:41.910 --> 05:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
sort of the
 
05:26:44.708 --> 05:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
standard and now I see this shift going
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
back to simple simpler
 
05:26:51.788 --> 05:26:51.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
05:26:54.788 --> 05:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
resources so again as we're seeing
 
05:26:56.590 --> 05:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
especially some of these bigger
 
05:27:02.310 --> 05:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
companies moving to paper based Goods uh
 
05:27:07.548 --> 05:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
packaging and so forth um I I do wonder
 
05:27:11.230 --> 05:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
if there is really any need to uh russan
 
05:27:14.070 --> 05:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
epr um procedure
 
05:27:16.868 --> 05:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
through um I don't know if I'd use the
 
05:27:18.868 --> 05:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
word rush I think that there's avenues
 
05:27:20.910 --> 05:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
that you can take to make sure that you
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
end up with a piece of legislation that
 
05:27:26.030 --> 05:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
you are happy with um again I will say
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
that the needs assessment is extremely
 
05:27:30.270 --> 05:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
important and that is an option um you
 
05:27:31.670 --> 05:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
can always move forward and needs you
 
05:27:33.230 --> 05:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
know you can again you can tweak the
 
05:27:34.548 --> 05:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
legislation to make sure that you have
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
that process first to um you know build
 
05:27:41.628 --> 05:27:41.638 align:start position:0%
that that timeline in it is necessary um
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
because like I said you you are seeing
 
05:27:46.270 --> 05:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
this but you are not it's not the
 
05:27:48.548 --> 05:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
majority um of how I mean these
 
05:27:49.910 --> 05:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
companies are really
 
05:27:55.110 --> 05:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
standouts um and you know plastic is
 
05:27:58.350 --> 05:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
cheap because the costs are not
 
05:28:01.310 --> 05:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
internalized right um plastic is
 
05:28:03.868 --> 05:28:03.878 align:start position:0%
produced in Louisiana and Texas and and
 
05:28:06.230 --> 05:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
in Appalachia now um it's produced in
 
05:28:08.070 --> 05:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
low income and communities of color so
 
05:28:09.430 --> 05:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
production we don't see we don't think
 
05:28:14.030 --> 05:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
about Upstream right um so it's really
 
05:28:15.788 --> 05:28:15.798 align:start position:0%
not a cheap material and we're going to
 
05:28:17.270 --> 05:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
see we're going to see those effects
 
05:28:19.310 --> 05:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
increasingly on our beaches on our
 
05:28:21.070 --> 05:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
streets you know microplastics I'm sure
 
05:28:23.868 --> 05:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
you're all reading about all the studies
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
that keep cropping up about where they
 
05:28:28.788 --> 05:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
are in our bodies um in the water you
 
05:28:30.788 --> 05:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
know they attract all of the chemical
 
05:28:33.070 --> 05:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
basically and become these little like I
 
05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
don't know what you call them little
 
05:28:38.270 --> 05:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
ships of chemical bombs um so I would
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
say we do have to have it in statute um
 
05:28:43.310 --> 05:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
we have to create a leing Level Playing
 
05:28:47.470 --> 05:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
Field and have everybody participating
 
05:28:49.708 --> 05:28:49.718 align:start position:0%
in this and seeing reduction across the
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
board again you know with new New
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being somewhat unique and that
 
05:28:57.310 --> 05:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
in that we have such a high percentage
 
05:28:59.150 --> 05:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
of out ofate waste coming
 
05:29:00.990 --> 05:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:29:03.390 --> 05:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
really starts to address that so that's
 
05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
what I would I would say thank you
 
05:29:10.190 --> 05:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so um one of the um
 
05:29:13.070 --> 05:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
elements in the bill is this is on page
 
05:29:18.190 --> 05:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
14 line three um in case of a producer
 
05:29:20.750 --> 05:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
that enters the market with 50% or more
 
05:29:22.628 --> 05:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
by weight of its packaging being
 
05:29:24.750 --> 05:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
reusable and contained within a reuse
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
and refill system that producer May
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
apply to the department for a waiver
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
from the packaging reduction
 
05:29:34.150 --> 05:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
requirements so that that sounds like
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
there is some kind of credit being given
 
05:29:38.670 --> 05:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
for people who are doing it right
 
05:29:40.030 --> 05:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
although that doesn't actually cover the
 
05:29:41.788 --> 05:29:41.798 align:start position:0%
entire range of people who are doing it
 
05:29:46.628 --> 05:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
right uh so uh do you think that that um
 
05:29:49.070 --> 05:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
that there should be a little bit more
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh extensive reward for people who
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
are doing things correctly because we
 
05:29:57.070 --> 05:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
don't want the PE we don't company want
 
05:29:58.750 --> 05:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
companies taking on the expense of doing
 
05:30:00.750 --> 05:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
it right and then getting undercut in
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
the marketplace because they're taking
 
05:30:05.868 --> 05:30:05.878 align:start position:0%
on the they're taking on the external
 
05:30:07.750 --> 05:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
alties and not making the external
 
05:30:10.510 --> 05:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
anymore that's where the Ecom modulated
 
05:30:13.628 --> 05:30:13.638 align:start position:0%
fees comes in to place right so so
 
05:30:16.270 --> 05:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
depending on the M there the fees are
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
set by U material choice and correct me
 
05:30:21.788 --> 05:30:21.798 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but that's I think Dees is
 
05:30:23.670 --> 05:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
part of that during rule Mak I'd have to
 
05:30:28.030 --> 05:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
revisit the particulars about that um so
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's where a company could still
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
choose another
 
05:30:35.390 --> 05:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
material in and they they're going to
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
pay more for it for the for the less
 
05:30:40.350 --> 05:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
desirable materials for so for the more
 
05:30:42.788 --> 05:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
you know toxic plastic they're going to
 
05:30:45.548 --> 05:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
pay more money right um whereas this the
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
person who's doing the right thing is
 
05:30:49.830 --> 05:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
going to pay less right so that's how
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to financially incentivize
 
05:30:53.590 --> 05:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
them to do that and someone had asked
 
05:30:56.470 --> 05:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
about Technologies you know I do want to
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
caution against um compostables or
 
05:31:00.948 --> 05:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
bioplastics they can still contain
 
05:31:02.830 --> 05:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel-based plastic it can still
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
contain peass and other chemicals that
 
05:31:07.830 --> 05:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
traditional Plastics do they can um and
 
05:31:10.230 --> 05:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
in that way mimic plastic in the marine
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
environment um or in the environment in
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
general so um but there are fiber you
 
05:31:17.110 --> 05:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
know certain Fiers certain materials and
 
05:31:20.270 --> 05:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
um melum so like mushroom based um
 
05:31:21.990 --> 05:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
materials that are being developed so
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
there are um some really Innovative cool
 
05:31:27.788 --> 05:31:27.798 align:start position:0%
things happening um and this will just
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
encourage more of
 
05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
you representative H Haskins thank you
 
05:31:36.868 --> 05:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
question these products are um in the
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
minority of companies that are making
 
05:31:46.628 --> 05:31:46.638 align:start position:0%
them would you agree with me that the
 
05:31:48.750 --> 05:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
reason why they're making them is
 
05:31:51.510 --> 05:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
because customers want
 
05:31:53.708 --> 05:31:53.718 align:start position:0%
them and
 
05:31:58.990 --> 05:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
so it follows in that logic that we want
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
to give our
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
state the right
 
05:32:07.910 --> 05:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
um laws to
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
incentivize more of this because people
 
05:32:15.830 --> 05:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
can't do it on their own so I applaud
 
05:32:18.190 --> 05:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
you for the information that you've
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
shared with us and I hope that we can do
 
05:32:24.590 --> 05:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
better for New Hampshire thank you thank
 
05:32:27.510 --> 05:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
you anyone else have a
 
05:32:29.788 --> 05:32:29.798 align:start position:0%
question no seeing none thank you so
 
05:32:32.030 --> 05:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony this afternoon
 
05:32:32.040 --> 05:32:33.548 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony this afternoon

bill um I've been awaiting this occasion
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
armed with scientific studies confirming
 
05:33:26.590 --> 05:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
the toxic effects of plastic packaging
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
that uh leech into air Soil and Water as
 
05:33:33.030 --> 05:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
well as the impact it has on our Public
 
05:33:35.948 --> 05:33:35.958 align:start position:0%
Health my colleagues and many others
 
05:33:38.910 --> 05:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
warn of the dangers of Plastic Products
 
05:33:42.150 --> 05:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
including packaging consisting of almost
 
05:33:45.628 --> 05:33:45.638 align:start position:0%
14,000 chemical additives most of which
 
05:33:48.430 --> 05:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
have not yet been studied and hardly
 
05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
regulated industry has announced it will
 
05:33:54.110 --> 05:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
triple plastic production by
 
05:33:58.510 --> 05:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
2050 at 3:30 a.m. my alarm went off
 
05:34:00.830 --> 05:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly I thought instantly that
 
05:34:03.548 --> 05:34:03.558 align:start position:0%
the Universe was sending a message wake
 
05:34:06.990 --> 05:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
up the time is now to mitigate an Ever
 
05:34:10.510 --> 05:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
growing waste stream onethird of which
 
05:34:13.628 --> 05:34:13.638 align:start position:0%
is packaging that ends up buried burned
 
05:34:16.590 --> 05:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
or borne out to sea often including
 
05:34:19.628 --> 05:34:19.638 align:start position:0%
pasas otherwise known as forever
 
05:34:22.030 --> 05:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
chemicals the alarm Bell is still
 
05:34:25.510 --> 05:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
ringing we have examples of epr for
 
05:34:28.470 --> 05:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
packaging bills successfully passed in
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
10 states and data to show that they are
 
05:34:34.150 --> 05:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
economically and environmentally
 
05:34:36.830 --> 05:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
viable our federal government recently
 
05:34:39.150 --> 05:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
introduced the break free from plastic
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
pollution act that currently has 12
 
05:34:45.230 --> 05:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
Senate and 45 house
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
part that humans ingest over 800
 
05:34:56.670 --> 05:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
microplastics per day microplastics have
 
05:34:59.230 --> 05:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
been found in human blood lungs and
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
breast mil
 
05:35:04.910 --> 05:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
40 450 million tons of plastic is
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
produced each year a number that's
 
05:35:11.030 --> 05:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
projected to Triple by 2050 in the US
 
05:35:13.548 --> 05:35:13.558 align:start position:0%
the rate of plastic waste recycling
 
05:35:18.430 --> 05:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
decreased in 2021 to between 4 and
 
05:35:22.470 --> 05:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
6% it is estimated that there are
 
05:35:25.628 --> 05:35:25.638 align:start position:0%
171 followed by 12 zeros I can't
 
05:35:27.868 --> 05:35:27.878 align:start position:0%
pronounce the the number pieces of
 
05:35:31.070 --> 05:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
plastic in the ocean and that 1,300
 
05:35:34.150 --> 05:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
marine species have consumed Plastics
 
05:35:36.430 --> 05:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
and finally Studies have projected that
 
05:35:39.270 --> 05:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
the Plastics industry will emit more
 
05:35:41.708 --> 05:35:41.718 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions than coal
 
05:35:44.430 --> 05:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
plants in the US by
 
05:35:48.830 --> 05:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
2030 its major solution in this bill is
 
05:35:53.070 --> 05:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
very similar to what hb1 1609 is
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
proposing number one it's requiring big
 
05:35:58.948 --> 05:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
corporations to take POS uh
 
05:36:01.628 --> 05:36:01.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility for their pollution by
 
05:36:04.150 --> 05:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
creating an extended producer
 
05:36:07.190 --> 05:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility policy it's a policy
 
05:36:08.788 --> 05:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
highlighting The Producers
 
05:36:11.070 --> 05:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the postc consumer
 
05:36:13.868 --> 05:36:13.878 align:start position:0%
management of its products and packaging
 
05:36:16.548 --> 05:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
this includes number one shifting
 
05:36:19.470 --> 05:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
financial and management responsibility
 
05:36:21.788 --> 05:36:21.798 align:start position:0%
with government and key stakeholder
 
05:36:24.830 --> 05:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
oversight away from the public and
 
05:36:28.070 --> 05:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
Upstream to the producer and number two
 
05:36:30.430 --> 05:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
providing incentives to produc producers
 
05:36:32.590 --> 05:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
to incorporate environmental
 
05:36:34.830 --> 05:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
considerations into the design of their
 
05:36:36.150 --> 05:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
products and
 
05:36:39.350 --> 05:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
packaging in addition it's requiring big
 
05:36:41.788 --> 05:36:41.798 align:start position:0%
corporations to take responsibility for
 
05:36:44.470 --> 05:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
pollution and establishes aggressive
 
05:36:47.390 --> 05:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
sorts reduction targets for single-use
 
05:36:53.548 --> 05:36:53.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:56.390 --> 05:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
containers here in New Hampshire we can
 
05:36:58.910 --> 05:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
respond proactively and with foresight
 
05:37:01.350 --> 05:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
and political will to reduce and
 
05:37:04.270 --> 05:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
regulate plastic production excuse me
 
05:37:07.430 --> 05:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
plastic packaging waste alarm Bells
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
including my own have sounded remember
 
05:37:13.590 --> 05:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
the YouTube video of the helpless turtle
 
05:37:16.390 --> 05:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
in excruciating pain with a plastic
 
05:37:19.830 --> 05:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
straw lodged in its nose researchers who
 
05:37:22.830 --> 05:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
rescued it painstakingly extricated the
 
05:37:26.030 --> 05:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
straw to facilitate its breathing
 
05:37:29.150 --> 05:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
thankfully the turtle survived our own
 
05:37:29.160 --> 05:37:30.150 align:start position:0%
thankfully the turtle survived our own
Survival

05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
Survival
 
05:37:33.030 --> 05:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
depends on the choices we make to avert
 
05:37:36.750 --> 05:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
Waste Management crisis an epr for
 
05:37:39.270 --> 05:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
packaging at both state and federal
 
05:37:42.110 --> 05:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
levels has already proven a positive
 
05:37:45.390 --> 05:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
solution as all turtles know slow but
 
05:37:49.750 --> 05:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
steady wins the race hb1 1630 will bring
 
05:37:52.590 --> 05:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
us to the starting line thank
 
05:37:54.868 --> 05:37:54.878 align:start position:0%
you any
 
05:37:57.190 --> 05:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
for your testimony this afternoon you're
 
05:37:59.280 --> 05:38:00.230 align:start position:0%
for your testimony this afternoon you're
welcome

05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:28.548 --> 05:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you madam chair and
 
05:38:30.750 --> 05:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
honorable members members of the
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Christine babber
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
from Dover New Hampshire and I am very
 
05:38:40.628 --> 05:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
pleased that our state is actively
 
05:38:43.230 --> 05:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
considering an extended producer
 
05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility bill that would provide
 
05:38:49.910 --> 05:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
incentives to manufacturers to develop
 
05:38:53.230 --> 05:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
products and packaging that will reduce
 
05:38:56.190 --> 05:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
the costs of managing Solid Waste for
 
05:38:59.670 --> 05:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and municip
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
alities and reduce the waste stream and
 
05:39:07.548 --> 05:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
toxics going into our landfills this
 
05:39:10.510 --> 05:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill responds directly I think you've
 
05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard people which is really
 
05:39:18.110 --> 05:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
great referring back to the uh 2022 New
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Solid Waste Management plan um
 
05:39:26.670 --> 05:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
it but this bill responds directly to
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
goal one of that plan um the goal of
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
reducing Solid Waste through Source
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
reduction I think Source reduction is
 
05:39:41.510 --> 05:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
the important piece to keep in mind here
 
05:39:45.788 --> 05:39:45.798 align:start position:0%
um and also goal two of reducing
 
05:39:48.948 --> 05:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
toxicity of the solid waste
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
stream our state's Readiness to proceed
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
with such a bill should also be
 
05:39:59.868 --> 05:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
bolstered by the grant funded New
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire waste characterization study
 
05:40:08.590 --> 05:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
that uh Dees is overseeing and I don't
 
05:40:10.110 --> 05:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
know if
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
that contract has actually been awarded
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
yet but um it was in process the last
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
time that I checked an e epr bill for
 
05:40:25.110 --> 05:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would have multiple
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
benefits um and I'm going to refer to
 
05:40:32.030 --> 05:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
some Research In My Testimony I'll be
 
05:40:35.350 --> 05:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
leaving a written copy with links to
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
that research and some of what I'll I'll
 
05:40:41.230 --> 05:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
be addressing are things that um have
 
05:40:43.868 --> 05:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
already been raised as
 
05:40:46.590 --> 05:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
questions so according to a recent
 
05:40:50.190 --> 05:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
report by the recycling partnership that
 
05:40:55.350 --> 05:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
looked at the impact of epr programs in
 
05:40:58.830 --> 05:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
seven jurisdictions worldwide the rest
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the world is ahead of us in this
 
05:41:06.590 --> 05:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
regard um and in six US states
 
05:41:11.190 --> 05:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
implementing epr programs found that it
 
05:41:15.430 --> 05:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
could increase overall recycling rates
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
by as much as
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
48% um that was from this particular
 
05:41:25.310 --> 05:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
study but I have also seen other studies
 
05:41:28.548 --> 05:41:28.558 align:start position:0%
that suggest it's been raised by as much
 
05:41:28.558 --> 05:41:30.948 align:start position:0%
that suggest it's been raised by as much
as

05:41:30.948 --> 05:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:41:35.430 --> 05:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
75% so education is a big piece of this
 
05:41:38.350 --> 05:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
Ecom modulation another big piece of
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
this um it also creates nearly Universal
 
05:41:47.910 --> 05:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
recycling access if you talk to people
 
05:41:51.468 --> 05:41:51.478 align:start position:0%
around the state you will find everybody
 
05:41:55.670 --> 05:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have good access to recycling
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
right now um even in Dover where I come
 
05:42:00.750 --> 05:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
from there are people who live in
 
05:42:03.390 --> 05:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings who say you know we
 
05:42:05.830 --> 05:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
C we we don't have recycling in our
 
05:42:10.548 --> 05:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
building what can we do about this um it
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
also creates thousands of jobs um
 
05:42:17.110 --> 05:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully eight of them would not be at
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
Dees I haven't figured out quite why
 
05:42:23.468 --> 05:42:23.478 align:start position:0%
that would be required but anyway um it
 
05:42:26.548 --> 05:42:26.558 align:start position:0%
would also boost the amount of recycled
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
content by millions of tons
 
05:42:34.310 --> 05:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and reduce hundreds of thousands of
 
05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
metric tons of climate damaging
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
emissions in epr states there there's
 
05:42:44.150 --> 05:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
been a good bit of discussion today
 
05:42:47.868 --> 05:42:47.878 align:start position:0%
about cost for taxpayers and
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities epr will reduce costs for
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and
 
05:42:57.190 --> 05:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities the product stewardship
 
05:43:00.910 --> 05:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
Institute claims that under our current
 
05:43:07.548 --> 05:43:07.558 align:start position:0%
recycling systems consumers pay three
 
05:43:10.868 --> 05:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
times we pay first for the packaging of
 
05:43:12.830 --> 05:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
the product we've we've heard different
 
05:43:17.830 --> 05:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
people mention the layers upon layers of
 
05:43:21.750 --> 05:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
packaging um a second time for the
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
collection of the waste material and a
 
05:43:28.310 --> 05:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
third time for the indirect costs
 
05:43:28.320 --> 05:43:29.628 align:start position:0%
third time for the indirect costs
associated

05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
associated
 
05:43:33.070 --> 05:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
with postc consumer packaging such as
 
05:43:35.628 --> 05:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
increased health insurance premiums
 
05:43:38.110 --> 05:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
resulting from higher illness and
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
disability caused by pollution caused by
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
toxics in that pollution um there's been
 
05:43:47.750 --> 05:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
some discussion today about well isn't
 
05:43:50.150 --> 05:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
this going to raise the cost of
 
05:43:53.590 --> 05:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
products a there um actually have been a
 
05:43:56.868 --> 05:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
couple of studies done on this a
 
05:44:00.708 --> 05:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
2022 analysis from from Colombia
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
University estimated that the impact of
 
05:44:11.350 --> 05:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
epr on customer costs would be about
 
05:44:11.360 --> 05:44:13.708 align:start position:0%
epr on customer costs would be about
a

05:44:13.708 --> 05:44:13.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:44:13.718 --> 05:44:15.468 align:start position:0%
a
69%

05:44:15.468 --> 05:44:15.478 align:start position:0%
69%
 
05:44:19.750 --> 05:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
increase okay so less than 1%
 
05:44:23.070 --> 05:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
increase a study Comm uh commissioned by
 
05:44:26.230 --> 05:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
the Oregon departmentment of
 
05:44:30.910 --> 05:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Quality compar paed prices
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
of common consumer
 
05:44:37.868 --> 05:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
products in epr and
 
05:44:41.350 --> 05:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
nonpr jurisdictions in Canada we heard
 
05:44:45.270 --> 05:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
this mentioned earlier it was a very
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
elegant study in that they actually went
 
05:44:54.350 --> 05:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
and selected products in the different
 
05:44:57.948 --> 05:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
provinces and compared the costs in
 
05:45:04.390 --> 05:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:08.030 --> 05:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
without the study found again as been
 
05:45:11.350 --> 05:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned no correlation between the
 
05:45:15.628 --> 05:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
existence of epr mandates and consumer
 
05:45:15.638 --> 05:45:17.830 align:start position:0%
existence of epr mandates and consumer
product

05:45:17.830 --> 05:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
product
 
05:45:21.468 --> 05:45:21.478 align:start position:0%
prices the conservation law Foundation
 
05:45:24.510 --> 05:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
asserts also that there's no credible
 
05:45:27.948 --> 05:45:27.958 align:start position:0%
data indicating that epr would raise
 
05:45:29.990 --> 05:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
consumer prices
 
05:45:34.030 --> 05:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
um they estimated that adopting epr
 
05:45:38.070 --> 05:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
policy would save Main's Municipal
 
05:45:41.990 --> 05:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers at least 16 million a year and
 
05:45:45.910 --> 05:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
we have heard that their process um is
 
05:45:49.510 --> 05:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
still underway but I would say that it
 
05:45:52.948 --> 05:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
could be reasonably expected that
 
05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.798 --> 05:45:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh another uh interesting piece I think
 
05:46:06.190 --> 05:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
when we're we're thinking about adopting
 
05:46:11.468 --> 05:46:11.478 align:start position:0%
bills such as this is that there is
 
05:46:15.670 --> 05:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
extensive support among voters for
 
05:46:20.310 --> 05:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
adopting policies such as epr a
 
05:46:25.788 --> 05:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
2023 Nationwide poll of us voters found
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support from both
 
05:46:28.798 --> 05:46:30.430 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support from both
Republicans

05:46:30.430 --> 05:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
Republicans
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:38.430 --> 05:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
86% for Shifting the cost and this was
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
in regard to plastic pollution for
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
Shifting the cost of cleaning up plastic
 
05:46:48.070 --> 05:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
pollution from taxpayers to the
 
05:46:53.070 --> 05:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
companies that make and use the excess
 
05:46:57.750 --> 05:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
plastic 66% of Democrats in a higher
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
number 70% % of Republicans say that
 
05:47:04.868 --> 05:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayers should not have to pay for the
 
05:47:10.750 --> 05:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
cleanup of plastic ways created by
 
05:47:15.190 --> 05:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
companies so it is not surprising that
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
82% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans
 
05:47:23.150 --> 05:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
agree that companies should stop
 
05:47:27.390 --> 05:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
producing and using so many single use
 
05:47:30.628 --> 05:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
Plastics and we could I think extend
 
05:47:32.868 --> 05:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
that thinking to some of the other
 
05:47:35.708 --> 05:47:35.718 align:start position:0%
products covered by
 
05:47:41.548 --> 05:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
epr House Bill 1630 would provide strong
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
effective policy the bill opportun
 
05:47:48.670 --> 05:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
offers opportunities to reduce waste
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
going into our burgeoning landfills to
 
05:47:54.788 --> 05:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
reduce the economic costs of dealing
 
05:47:57.990 --> 05:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
with difficult to recycle plastic and
 
05:47:59.548 --> 05:47:59.558 align:start position:0%
other ways
 
05:48:02.948 --> 05:48:02.958 align:start position:0%
to reduce a broad range of toxic
 
05:48:05.670 --> 05:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are
 
05:48:05.680 --> 05:48:08.030 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are
carcinogenic

05:48:08.030 --> 05:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic
 
05:48:11.390 --> 05:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
mutagenic meaning that they U cause
 
05:48:15.830 --> 05:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:19.750 --> 05:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:23.468 --> 05:48:23.478 align:start position:0%
disrupting it also um this bill would
 
05:48:26.670 --> 05:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
Increase jobs it would educate
 
05:48:29.310 --> 05:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
businesses and residents
 
05:48:32.910 --> 05:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
about responsible reduction Reuse
 
05:48:36.788 --> 05:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
Recycling or disposal of discarded
 
05:48:40.548 --> 05:48:40.558 align:start position:0%
packaging and I think particularly
 
05:48:43.430 --> 05:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
important it would help protect the
 
05:48:46.590 --> 05:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
health of our environment and
 
05:48:50.468 --> 05:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
residents I hope that you will seize
 
05:48:53.190 --> 05:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to benefit New
 
05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and its residents and vote
 
05:49:01.468 --> 05:49:01.478 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill
 
05:49:05.750 --> 05:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
1630 um I would also like to say that I
 
05:49:10.510 --> 05:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
think that I attended pretty much all of
 
05:49:14.468 --> 05:49:14.478 align:start position:0%
the committee meetings on this bill on
 
05:49:14.478 --> 05:49:15.510 align:start position:0%
the committee meetings on this bill on
uh

05:49:15.510 --> 05:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
epr and considering the short amount of
 
05:49:21.350 --> 05:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
time I was
 
05:49:24.390 --> 05:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
impressed with the work
 
05:49:28.708 --> 05:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
that representative parall did about how
 
05:49:33.230 --> 05:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
he tried to engage everyone including
 
05:49:37.230 --> 05:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
those of us from the public um they
 
05:49:41.990 --> 05:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
listening in um to help make this a good
 
05:49:45.750 --> 05:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
bill um from just an Outsiders
 
05:49:48.350 --> 05:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
perspective I think a piece of the
 
05:49:52.390 --> 05:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
problem was that a lot of the some of
 
05:49:55.070 --> 05:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
the committee members were not
 
05:50:00.110 --> 05:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
there so um I I think if
 
05:50:04.230 --> 05:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
you look at this bill how complex it is
 
05:50:07.350 --> 05:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
how much is there I would hope that
 
05:50:11.468 --> 05:50:11.478 align:start position:0%
representative partiall gets credit for
 
05:50:15.788 --> 05:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
how hard he has worked on this thank
 
05:50:18.670 --> 05:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee no seeing none thank you so
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:33.350 --> 05:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
card and and uh May yep oh There She

afternoon

05:51:06.708 --> 05:51:06.718 align:start position:0%

committee is holding the hearings on epr
 
05:52:04.750 --> 05:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
today um I support HB uh 1630 and I urge
 
05:52:08.468 --> 05:52:08.478 align:start position:0%
you to vote out to pass on it I'm
 
05:52:11.628 --> 05:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
speaking for municipalities and I'm
 
05:52:15.270 --> 05:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
speaking for taxpayers when I support
 
05:52:15.280 --> 05:52:18.390 align:start position:0%
speaking for taxpayers when I support
this

05:52:18.390 --> 05:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:21.750 --> 05:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill this bill outlines the Keystone to
 
05:52:24.670 --> 05:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
addressing New Hampshire's waste crisis
 
05:52:26.670 --> 05:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
which is reduction of the waste before
 
05:52:29.628 --> 05:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
it becomes waste combined with Shifting
 
05:52:32.350 --> 05:52:32.360 align:start position:0%
the burden from the consumer and the
 
05:52:35.750 --> 05:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
towns to those who produce the waste in
 
05:52:38.990 --> 05:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
the first place enactment of this law
 
05:52:41.230 --> 05:52:41.240 align:start position:0%
would provide a huge benefit for the
 
05:52:44.030 --> 05:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
towns of Hopkinson and Webster who share
 
05:52:46.510 --> 05:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
a transfer station which is located in
 
05:52:46.520 --> 05:52:48.350 align:start position:0%
a transfer station which is located in
Hopkin

05:52:48.350 --> 05:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
Hopkin
 
05:52:50.788 --> 05:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton um most of what I'm sharing
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
today comes from my experience as the
 
05:52:56.628 --> 05:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
chair of the waste reduction committee
 
05:52:59.150 --> 05:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
um and as an environmental polic analyst
 
05:53:00.990 --> 05:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'm no longer chair of the committee and
 
05:53:03.110 --> 05:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
I am not speaking for the committee or
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
the town I'm speaking as an individual
 
05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
today but that's where I get my
 
05:53:06.718 --> 05:53:08.548 align:start position:0%
today but that's where I get my
information

05:53:08.548 --> 05:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:53:10.948 --> 05:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
from the most important thing you can
 
05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
take away from my testimony today is
 
05:53:16.070 --> 05:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
that our town and I'm sure we're not
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
different from other towns is drowning
 
05:53:22.948 --> 05:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
in waste drowning in
 
05:53:25.830 --> 05:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
waste it's both the the waste that gets
 
05:53:27.628 --> 05:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
thrown into the hopper you know the
 
05:53:30.030 --> 05:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
compact that pushes it into the trailer
 
05:53:31.788 --> 05:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
that takes it to the
 
05:53:34.830 --> 05:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
landfill and it's also the recycling
 
05:53:37.390 --> 05:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
streams that we send to Market to
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
produce offsetting revenue for that
 
05:53:42.150 --> 05:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
waste we have to pay for in tipping fees
 
05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
at the
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
landfill The Lion Share of this waste
 
05:53:48.468 --> 05:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
could be avoided by Source reduction in
 
05:53:51.070 --> 05:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
this case the reduction of packaging
 
05:53:53.390 --> 05:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
that you've heard before the EPA
 
05:53:56.230 --> 05:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
estimates that about a third of our mssw
 
05:53:58.628 --> 05:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
which is our Municipal Solid Waste comes
 
05:53:58.638 --> 05:53:59.948 align:start position:0%
which is our Municipal Solid Waste comes
from

05:53:59.948 --> 05:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:54:03.110 --> 05:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
packaging and that is why New Hampshire
 
05:54:05.030 --> 05:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
has set Source reduction of waste
 
05:54:07.468 --> 05:54:07.478 align:start position:0%
materials at the top of the hierarchy
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
for preferred Waste Management
 
05:54:10.910 --> 05:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
strategies I think Christine just
 
05:54:10.920 --> 05:54:12.110 align:start position:0%
strategies I think Christine just
mentioned

05:54:12.110 --> 05:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
05:54:15.230 --> 05:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
that well as they say p a picture is
 
05:54:17.948 --> 05:54:17.958 align:start position:0%
worth a thousand words so I've provided
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
you a few visuals of what I mean when I
 
05:54:22.830 --> 05:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
say we're drowning and
 
05:54:25.990 --> 05:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
waste um Hopkinson and Webster are are
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
Source separating recycling towns which
 
05:54:30.670 --> 05:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
means that instead of putting all of our
 
05:54:32.990 --> 05:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
recyclables into one bin we separate
 
05:54:34.750 --> 05:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
them out into
 
05:54:37.788 --> 05:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
streams we have cardboard paper aluminum
 
05:54:41.110 --> 05:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
steel cans plastic bottles and jugs and
 
05:54:43.270 --> 05:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
the first picture in my statement which
 
05:54:46.788 --> 05:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
I'll try to show you is our cardboard
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
this was on
 
05:54:51.590 --> 05:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
Saturday I don't know if you can see
 
05:54:54.270 --> 05:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
that in the middle is the cardboard Bay
 
05:54:56.430 --> 05:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's spilling out all over the parking
 
05:54:58.590 --> 05:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
and drop off area
 
05:55:01.750 --> 05:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
to the left of the cardboard is our
 
05:55:04.708 --> 05:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
mixed paper which you can't even see
 
05:55:07.750 --> 05:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
because it's so full and so full of
 
05:55:09.750 --> 05:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
overflowing cardboard and to the right
 
05:55:11.788 --> 05:55:11.798 align:start position:0%
is our bailing station that's where we
 
05:55:14.868 --> 05:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
have our Bailer to bail it up and send
 
05:55:18.788 --> 05:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
it um bailed materials always command a
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
much higher price in revenues on the
 
05:55:23.590 --> 05:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
recycling Market than loose materials
 
05:55:26.390 --> 05:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
which is why we bail them
 
05:55:30.150 --> 05:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
up um so you might ask you know is this
 
05:55:32.990 --> 05:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
mess of cardboard and packaging is just
 
05:55:35.390 --> 05:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
just a glut of materials from the
 
05:55:38.910 --> 05:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
holiday season well I could show you a
 
05:55:42.590 --> 05:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
similar picture taken on October 14th
 
05:55:45.990 --> 05:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't look much different yes
 
05:55:48.830 --> 05:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's always more waste after the
 
05:55:53.070 --> 05:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
holidays but we are always drowning in
 
05:55:56.468 --> 05:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
it so we we just can't keep up with what
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
comes into our towns
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
and what happens to this cardboard that
 
05:56:02.430 --> 05:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
you see spilling out all over the place
 
05:56:05.350 --> 05:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
when we get 8 Ines of snow like we
 
05:56:08.590 --> 05:56:08.600 align:start position:0%
did it's it's destroyed you cannot
 
05:56:11.868 --> 05:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
recycle and send to Market wet cardboard
 
05:56:15.468 --> 05:56:15.478 align:start position:0%
so cardboard which we get about $100 a
 
05:56:18.670 --> 05:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
ton in revenue from once it gets wet
 
05:56:20.590 --> 05:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
because we don't we have so much we
 
05:56:22.310 --> 05:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
can't store it we can't keep up with
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
bailing it it goes to the landfill so in
 
05:56:28.510 --> 05:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
the landfill at TurnKey we pay
 
05:56:33.390 --> 05:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
close to $100 a ton in tipping fee so
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
what should be a revenue of $100 a ton
 
05:56:39.548 --> 05:56:39.558 align:start position:0%
to offset our cost becomes a cost to
 
05:56:41.788 --> 05:56:41.798 align:start position:0%
throw it in the landfill it's an expense
 
05:56:46.150 --> 05:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:48.788 --> 05:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
town so cardboard is
 
05:56:51.230 --> 05:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
packaging you can see how hard it is to
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
keep up with this steady
 
05:56:55.590 --> 05:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
inflow um and cardboard is just one of
 
05:56:58.548 --> 05:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
the recyclables that we take in you move
 
05:57:02.030 --> 05:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
move down in um my statement you see
 
05:57:02.040 --> 05:57:04.150 align:start position:0%
move down in um my statement you see
aluminum

05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
aluminum
 
05:57:07.468 --> 05:57:07.478 align:start position:0%
cans mostly you know beverage
 
05:57:07.478 --> 05:57:09.868 align:start position:0%
cans mostly you know beverage
cans

05:57:09.868 --> 05:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
cans
 
05:57:12.868 --> 05:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
and aluminum the price has gone up and
 
05:57:16.070 --> 05:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
down and uh we have a real backlog of
 
05:57:19.628 --> 05:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
aluminum now what we get bailed up we
 
05:57:21.948 --> 05:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
are now storing in shipping containers
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:26.798 --> 05:57:30.350 align:start position:0%
 
station

05:57:30.350 --> 05:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
and then we move on to
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
plastic this is number one pet p called
 
05:57:39.230 --> 05:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
Pete it's basically your
 
05:57:43.430 --> 05:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
bottles um Pete has been Rock Bottom in
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
the market lately it's very hard to move
 
05:57:48.468 --> 05:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
Pete it does go up and down but it's
 
05:57:51.910 --> 05:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
been down for a long time I mean that is
 
05:57:55.390 --> 05:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
just a flood so what do we do with all
 
05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
that then we have our number two to
 
05:57:58.878 --> 05:58:00.708 align:start position:0%
that then we have our number two to
natural

05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
natural
 
05:58:02.670 --> 05:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
jugs you can
 
05:58:06.110 --> 05:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
see basically milk jugs anything that's
 
05:58:09.510 --> 05:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
not colored plastic that commands the
 
05:58:11.628 --> 05:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
highest price in Plastics and the reason
 
05:58:14.150 --> 05:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
is because when they reuse it and
 
05:58:16.468 --> 05:58:16.478 align:start position:0%
recycle it it can be dyed to any other
 
05:58:19.150 --> 05:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
color but once you get a dyed color you
 
05:58:21.310 --> 05:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
can only make it into that dyed color
 
05:58:24.390 --> 05:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
again so this is the Overflow that we
 
05:58:26.830 --> 05:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
have in that what I'm getting at is it's
 
05:58:28.670 --> 05:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
just really hard to move these
 
05:58:30.390 --> 05:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
recyclables it's not that people aren't
 
05:58:32.670 --> 05:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
bringing them in and recycling them it's
 
05:58:37.310 --> 05:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:42.070 --> 05:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
market so all of this packaging it only
 
05:58:45.468 --> 05:58:45.478 align:start position:0%
represents what people choose to recycle
 
05:58:48.310 --> 05:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
what doesn't get recycled goes into what
 
05:58:50.030 --> 05:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
we call the hopper which is the
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
compactor that pushes it all into the
 
05:58:53.430 --> 05:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
trailer to go to the
 
05:58:55.868 --> 05:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
landfill and as I mentioned before that
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
tends to be about a third
 
05:58:59.788 --> 05:58:59.798 align:start position:0%
of our
 
05:58:59.798 --> 05:59:01.548 align:start position:0%
of our
MSW

05:59:01.548 --> 05:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
MSW
 
05:59:06.030 --> 05:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
so we generally produce about 3,200 tons
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
of MSW a year in hopkington and Webster
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
so a third of that about a th000 tons
 
05:59:16.590 --> 05:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
is it's just
 
05:59:20.030 --> 05:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
packaging and it costs taxpayers over
 
05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
$100,000 just to dispose of that
 
05:59:27.468 --> 05:59:27.478 align:start position:0%
packaging so what causes this overflow
 
05:59:29.150 --> 05:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
in this glut of all this stuff well
 
05:59:31.830 --> 05:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of factors but for
 
05:59:33.948 --> 05:59:33.958 align:start position:0%
practical on the ground purposes you
 
05:59:36.070 --> 05:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
might ask well why can't we just bail up
 
05:59:38.830 --> 05:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
faster and move it faster to the market
 
05:59:40.350 --> 05:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
I already mentioned that the markets are
 
05:59:42.150 --> 05:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
up and down and a lot of them are very
 
05:59:44.670 --> 05:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
slow but then we have a staffing problem
 
05:59:46.030 --> 05:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
at our transfer
 
05:59:49.030 --> 05:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
station it's not a glamorous job to work
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
at a transfer station and the least
 
05:59:53.430 --> 05:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
glamorous of the unglamorous jobs is
 
05:59:57.310 --> 05:59:57.320 align:start position:0%
bailing recyclables in the Bor building
 
06:00:00.430 --> 06:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
these these are uh part-time workers
 
06:00:02.670 --> 06:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
they receive no benefits the work is
 
06:00:05.548 --> 06:00:05.558 align:start position:0%
hard it's dirty and it's physically
 
06:00:08.468 --> 06:00:08.478 align:start position:0%
demanding it's very hard to keep we have
 
06:00:11.350 --> 06:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
three positions for part-time for this
 
06:00:14.750 --> 06:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to keep it staffed up and
 
06:00:16.590 --> 06:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
then we look at the infrastructure what
 
06:00:18.468 --> 06:00:18.478 align:start position:0%
does it take to bail up all this stuff
 
06:00:20.910 --> 06:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
and move it all this packaging that we
 
06:00:24.230 --> 06:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
wish we didn't have well Hopkinson has
 
06:00:28.948 --> 06:00:28.958 align:start position:0%
an older style Bor it's a vertical Bor
 
06:00:30.750 --> 06:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
what we really need is a horizontal
 
06:00:34.150 --> 06:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
bailor a vertical Bor takes about three
 
06:00:38.590 --> 06:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
staff people 5 hours to produce a bail
 
06:00:41.150 --> 06:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
if you have a horizontal Bailer it would
 
06:00:44.430 --> 06:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
only take two staff people an hour to
 
06:00:47.628 --> 06:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
produce a bail so why don't we just get
 
06:00:50.070 --> 06:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
a horizontal Bailer well horizontal
 
06:00:51.910 --> 06:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
bailers cost
 
06:00:55.350 --> 06:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
$90,000 it's a lot of money that's not
 
06:00:57.868 --> 06:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
the only infrastructure need in capital
 
06:00:59.468 --> 06:00:59.478 align:start position:0%
Improvement need that we need at the
 
06:01:01.310 --> 06:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
transfer station we have to keep up with
 
06:01:05.270 --> 06:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
our trailers we have our our loaders and
 
06:01:06.910 --> 06:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
we have all the other equipment that we
 
06:01:08.430 --> 06:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
need to process
 
06:01:12.190 --> 06:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
waste so that's that's just a lot of
 
06:01:18.070 --> 06:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
money our um waste uh transfer station
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
budget this year is the highest it's
 
06:01:22.750 --> 06:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
ever been
 
06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
$800,000 that's
 
06:01:28.190 --> 06:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
astronomical and on top of that
 
06:01:30.990 --> 06:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
hopkington has a pasas problem our
 
06:01:33.030 --> 06:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
septage lagoons which had to be shut
 
06:01:34.468 --> 06:01:34.478 align:start position:0%
down by
 
06:01:37.868 --> 06:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
Dees were receiving all kinds of toxins
 
06:01:37.878 --> 06:01:38.788 align:start position:0%
Dees were receiving all kinds of toxins
and

06:01:38.788 --> 06:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:01:41.628 --> 06:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
pasas so they had to be shut down and
 
06:01:45.510 --> 06:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
now we're facing a 4 million bond to
 
06:01:48.390 --> 06:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
clean that pasas up and that doesn't
 
06:01:50.270 --> 06:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
even include the pasas that's in our
 
06:01:52.990 --> 06:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant sludge that's
 
06:01:55.910 --> 06:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
a whole separate thing $4 million last
 
06:01:58.910 --> 06:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
year we passed a 2 million doll Highway
 
06:02:02.190 --> 06:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
Bond at town meeting everybody was like
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
o that's a lot but we realized it was
 
06:02:06.750 --> 06:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance wait till people
 
06:02:10.430 --> 06:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
see the $4 million Bond warrant article
 
06:02:13.190 --> 06:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
at town meeting people are going to say
 
06:02:14.390 --> 06:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
what the
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
heck anyway what I'm just saying is that
 
06:02:20.548 --> 06:02:20.558 align:start position:0%
waste is very very expensive and of
 
06:02:22.310 --> 06:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
course the operating budget and the
 
06:02:25.150 --> 06:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
capital Improvement fund all comes from
 
06:02:29.230 --> 06:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer that's us that's the little
 
06:02:32.468 --> 06:02:32.478 align:start position:0%
person so that's pretty much my
 
06:02:34.830 --> 06:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
testimony I hope that the pictures help
 
06:02:37.270 --> 06:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
give a visual of where we're at I did
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
want to mention that um my very last
 
06:02:44.708 --> 06:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
point is director whimet um was talking
 
06:02:46.350 --> 06:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
about not being able to support this
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
bill because of needing eight staff
 
06:02:51.270 --> 06:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
people I can totally appreciate that
 
06:02:54.150 --> 06:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
would take a lot of staff to implement
 
06:02:58.230 --> 06:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
an epr program however governor sununu's
 
06:03:01.310 --> 06:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
Administration just recently in uh fall
 
06:03:04.350 --> 06:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
of 2022 issued a solid waste management
 
06:03:07.628 --> 06:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
plan it has eight goals and each goal
 
06:03:10.708 --> 06:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
has strategies and goal number one is
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
guess what source reduction because the
 
06:03:18.390 --> 06:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
cheapest waste for taxpayers to pay for
 
06:03:20.110 --> 06:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
is the waste that never gets produced in
 
06:03:21.270 --> 06:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
the first
 
06:03:24.350 --> 06:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
place so if you go to Pages nine and 10
 
06:03:26.390 --> 06:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and that you know when the question was
 
06:03:28.270 --> 06:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
asked in the the solid waste working
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
group did they ever work on epr well not
 
06:03:33.670 --> 06:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
directly on this bill but that was a big
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
part that plan came out of the solid
 
06:03:38.628 --> 06:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
waste working group and that was a big
 
06:03:40.990 --> 06:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
part of what they talked about and it
 
06:03:42.868 --> 06:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
ended up being goal number
 
06:03:45.868 --> 06:03:45.878 align:start position:0%
one as I mentioned there are strategies
 
06:03:49.150 --> 06:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
in all of these goals and there's a
 
06:03:51.390 --> 06:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
legislative strategy for each one and
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
for Source reduction it says explore
 
06:03:57.548 --> 06:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
legislation including extended produc or
 
06:03:59.948 --> 06:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
responsibility programs that would
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
require product Brands and manufacturers
 
06:04:05.948 --> 06:04:05.958 align:start position:0%
M manufacturers to enhance the
 
06:04:07.788 --> 06:04:07.798 align:start position:0%
recyclability of their products and
 
06:04:10.070 --> 06:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
packaging and minimize the use of
 
06:04:13.310 --> 06:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary materials and single use
 
06:04:16.310 --> 06:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
Plastics this is the sonunu
 
06:04:18.350 --> 06:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
administration's plan it's right there
 
06:04:19.670 --> 06:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
in black and
 
06:04:23.948 --> 06:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
white so hb1 1630 does exactly that it
 
06:04:25.270 --> 06:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
starts that
 
06:04:30.310 --> 06:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
process so in conclusion um waste
 
06:04:33.468 --> 06:04:33.478 align:start position:0%
management is a huge burden for towns
 
06:04:35.830 --> 06:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
and for taxpayers for operating budgets
 
06:04:38.190 --> 06:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
and our Capital budgets and we
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
desperately need help to reduce these
 
06:04:42.270 --> 06:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
costs they're so
 
06:04:45.430 --> 06:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so we urge you I urge you to
 
06:04:48.030 --> 06:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on this bill and I
 
06:04:50.510 --> 06:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate very much that you heard my
 
06:04:52.548 --> 06:04:52.558 align:start position:0%
testimony and I know it's been a long
 
06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
day so thank you so much thank you any
 
06:04:57.788 --> 06:04:57.798 align:start position:0%
questions in the committee
 
06:05:01.350 --> 06:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative dsy uh yes C uh what is
 
06:05:03.548 --> 06:05:03.558 align:start position:0%
the population of
 
06:05:07.708 --> 06:05:07.718 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson approximately hopkington is
 
06:05:10.430 --> 06:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
just over 6,000 and then we share
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
transfer station with Webster so I think
 
06:05:17.110 --> 06:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
the combined um residential contribution
 
06:05:21.708 --> 06:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
is a little over 700,000
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
people sorry yeah we're not that big yet
 
06:05:29.788 --> 06:05:29.798 align:start position:0%
7,000 sorry yes yep
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you so I just just a comment
 
06:05:36.390 --> 06:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:40.430 --> 06:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
know it seems as if as if your recycling
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
efforts in hopkington have been more
 
06:05:46.548 --> 06:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
successful than what hopkington can
 
06:05:50.110 --> 06:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
handle I mean people are bringing in
 
06:05:53.830 --> 06:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
recyclable items cardboard
 
06:05:57.150 --> 06:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
plastic and various other you know class
 
06:05:59.390 --> 06:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
ifications of
 
06:06:02.628 --> 06:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
plastic um and I realized that
 
06:06:06.510 --> 06:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities do have a an expense in
 
06:06:09.590 --> 06:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
handling that material and being able to
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
handle it in a way that would bring them
 
06:06:15.670 --> 06:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
top dollar for uh being able to dispose
 
06:06:19.788 --> 06:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:19.798 --> 06:06:22.628 align:start position:0%
 
handling

06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
handling
 
06:06:26.510 --> 06:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
so if we're I guess I know this bill
 
06:06:32.708 --> 06:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
seeks to reduce uh the production of
 
06:06:35.708 --> 06:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
packaging but there's also so much
 
06:06:37.670 --> 06:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
packaging that we really can't get away
 
06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
from and if we are say um foregoing a
 
06:06:45.590 --> 06:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
lot of plastic to use cardboard
 
06:06:49.990 --> 06:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
instead then I would imagine that our
 
06:06:53.070 --> 06:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities would want to be able to
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate that
 
06:07:03.310 --> 06:07:03.320 align:start position:0%
um uptick in in uh the use of other
 
06:07:05.548 --> 06:07:05.558 align:start position:0%
materials which are more
 
06:07:09.788 --> 06:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
preferential so how would you say um how
 
06:07:11.948 --> 06:07:11.958 align:start position:0%
would you say
 
06:07:15.750 --> 06:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
that recycling efforts are they not are
 
06:07:19.788 --> 06:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
they not working properly for these
 
06:07:24.230 --> 06:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
towns um I can say that well I can give
 
06:07:27.030 --> 06:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
you another factoid which is that every
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
year we calculate what percentage of our
 
06:07:32.750 --> 06:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
total waste is recycled and every year
 
06:07:34.910 --> 06:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's been going down and down and down
 
06:07:37.310 --> 06:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
we're now down to 133% the highest we
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
ever were was
 
06:07:42.070 --> 06:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
22% meanwhile the waste going to the
 
06:07:44.390 --> 06:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
landfill the tonnage has been going up
 
06:07:48.190 --> 06:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
and up and up over the last decade our
 
06:07:50.868 --> 06:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
tonnage increased over 20% that were
 
06:07:51.868 --> 06:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
sending to
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
TurnKey and our population increased
 
06:07:57.390 --> 06:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
less than 6%
 
06:08:01.030 --> 06:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
so there's there's more stuff going on I
 
06:08:03.708 --> 06:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
think in terms of your question about
 
06:08:06.468 --> 06:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
the packaging and will this just bring
 
06:08:09.310 --> 06:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
more that maybe we'll have struggle
 
06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
continue to struggle to handle I think
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
the goal is to minimize packaging there
 
06:08:15.868 --> 06:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
will always be a need for a packaging
 
06:08:18.468 --> 06:08:18.478 align:start position:0%
the question is what kind of packaging
 
06:08:21.150 --> 06:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
what can you do with it at the end of
 
06:08:22.390 --> 06:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
its life
 
06:08:26.948 --> 06:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
cycle and you know why do we need you
 
06:08:29.070 --> 06:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
know you see people put going to the
 
06:08:31.110 --> 06:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
grocery store and putting one or two
 
06:08:35.590 --> 06:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
items in a big shopping bag why you you
 
06:08:37.788 --> 06:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
see vegetables I like to go to hanford's
 
06:08:40.190 --> 06:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
and you know they have what I call the
 
06:08:42.150 --> 06:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
naked produce section you know there's
 
06:08:45.310 --> 06:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
no packaging I love that but in other
 
06:08:47.350 --> 06:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
places you will see you know a head of
 
06:08:52.030 --> 06:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
broccoli wrapped in plastic why you know
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
let's minimize and get rid of all the
 
06:08:56.990 --> 06:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary packaging and let's use the
 
06:09:00.430 --> 06:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
packaging that we really need for you
 
06:09:02.390 --> 06:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
know protection of the consumer goods
 
06:09:05.070 --> 06:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
and for health and safety and to make it
 
06:09:07.548 --> 06:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
manageable and profitable for the
 
06:09:09.910 --> 06:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and restaurants and so
 
06:09:13.110 --> 06:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
forth that that handle things but you
 
06:09:15.070 --> 06:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
know when when I pick up a pizza at my
 
06:09:18.270 --> 06:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
local place and they automatically throw
 
06:09:19.310 --> 06:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
in a
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
plastic wrapped um bundle of plastic
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
utensils knife Fork and Spoon
 
06:09:32.030 --> 06:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I I've got a pizza and I'm like why
 
06:09:36.548 --> 06:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's just we have this this sort of
 
06:09:39.230 --> 06:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
um autopilot thing that has been going
 
06:09:41.510 --> 06:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
on for a long time people figure oh it's
 
06:09:43.270 --> 06:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
take out you need some
 
06:09:45.750 --> 06:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
utensils it's not that hard to rethink
 
06:09:48.510 --> 06:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
that and I think it really does come
 
06:09:51.390 --> 06:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
down to minimizing using only what's
 
06:09:53.468 --> 06:09:53.478 align:start position:0%
necessary and using the best materials
 
06:09:54.948 --> 06:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
possible thank
 
06:09:57.548 --> 06:09:57.558 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
06:09:59.430 --> 06:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
06:10:01.548 --> 06:10:01.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm curious to
 
06:10:04.350 --> 06:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
know if I um understood you correctly in
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
saying that um you made mention to I
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to reference your photos
 
06:10:11.030 --> 06:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you for providing those um this
 
06:10:13.150 --> 06:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
shipping container that sits now on your
 
06:10:16.190 --> 06:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
property because um if I heard your
 
06:10:18.190 --> 06:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
statement correctly the markets are not
 
06:10:20.230 --> 06:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily supporting you getting it
 
06:10:23.070 --> 06:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
off your site fast enough is that what I
 
06:10:24.708 --> 06:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
was hearing that's part of the problem
 
06:10:28.830 --> 06:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
is you it it's not economically
 
06:10:31.510 --> 06:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
efficient to send out small loads you
 
06:10:34.350 --> 06:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
wait until you have I don't know what
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
they call them a full a full load and so
 
06:10:39.708 --> 06:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
you always have some Bales sitting on
 
06:10:42.590 --> 06:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
the premises but the other thing is you
 
06:10:45.230 --> 06:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
know those baales are not going to move
 
06:10:47.948 --> 06:10:47.958 align:start position:0%
full load or not if the cost is gone
 
06:10:51.750 --> 06:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
like this so that's why they sit there
 
06:10:55.868 --> 06:10:55.878 align:start position:0%
um follow if I may sure follow up uh
 
06:10:57.868 --> 06:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I mean no pun
 
06:10:59.150 --> 06:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
intended but are you concerned that
 
06:11:00.430 --> 06:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities are going to be left
 
06:11:04.150 --> 06:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
holding the bag on like having a bunch
 
06:11:06.868 --> 06:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
of material sitting somewhere that
 
06:11:09.510 --> 06:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm really I'm really worried
 
06:11:11.670 --> 06:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
about that I mean the other reason that
 
06:11:14.430 --> 06:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
we have our cans in in shipping
 
06:11:16.548 --> 06:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
containers is because our recycling shed
 
06:11:18.868 --> 06:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
where we usually store these bailed up
 
06:11:21.670 --> 06:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
things waiting for Market
 
06:11:24.750 --> 06:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
is I mean it's got holes in it it's got
 
06:11:27.070 --> 06:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
leaks in the roof I mean there is so
 
06:11:28.868 --> 06:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
much deferred maintenance and it would
 
06:11:31.350 --> 06:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
cost so much to bring everything up to
 
06:11:33.708 --> 06:11:33.718 align:start position:0%
spec in our transfer station it's just
 
06:11:35.590 --> 06:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
people have no idea what it costs to
 
06:11:37.948 --> 06:11:37.958 align:start position:0%
manage waste
 
06:11:41.628 --> 06:11:41.638 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's that's part of it but
 
06:11:44.590 --> 06:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
yes I think we are now holding left
 
06:11:46.750 --> 06:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
holding the bag on this kind of stuff
 
06:11:48.750 --> 06:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm very concerned about Plastics
 
06:11:51.590 --> 06:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
because now there's this movement as
 
06:11:54.468 --> 06:11:54.478 align:start position:0%
somebody asked is consumers are asking
 
06:11:57.510 --> 06:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
for um you know different kind of
 
06:12:01.070 --> 06:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
things and more recyclable things and
 
06:12:04.708 --> 06:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
more eco-friendly things for packaging
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
so you know for example the the number
 
06:12:11.628 --> 06:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
one pet like your soda bottles there's a
 
06:12:13.708 --> 06:12:13.718 align:start position:0%
lot of things now and you look on the
 
06:12:17.070 --> 06:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
label it says made with 60% you know
 
06:12:20.548 --> 06:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
recycled plastic okay recycled plastic
 
06:12:23.270 --> 06:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
is not as good as virgin plastic I mean
 
06:12:25.750 --> 06:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
it works the first time around but every
 
06:12:28.030 --> 06:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
time you mix that in with the Virgin
 
06:12:31.030 --> 06:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
plastic then you've got this degraded
 
06:12:33.910 --> 06:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
plastic and as I think Christine
 
06:12:36.390 --> 06:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned I forget what the fact is
 
06:12:38.590 --> 06:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
about how much plastic the Plastic
 
06:12:41.750 --> 06:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
industry is you know planned to produce
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
the increase in the next decade it's
 
06:12:47.468 --> 06:12:47.478 align:start position:0%
astronomical and the they're saying oh
 
06:12:50.548 --> 06:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
just recycle it all it's not going to
 
06:12:53.350 --> 06:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
work I mean I think part of the problem
 
06:12:55.230 --> 06:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
with the pet is there's a glut of
 
06:12:57.788 --> 06:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
plastic out there you know there's a lot
 
06:13:01.468 --> 06:13:01.478 align:start position:0%
of it and there's more and more so you
 
06:13:03.750 --> 06:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
know it's a supply and demand thing the
 
06:13:06.270 --> 06:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
cost the revenues go down when the
 
06:13:07.948 --> 06:13:07.958 align:start position:0%
supply is just
 
06:13:12.750 --> 06:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
flooded so y representative ger thank
 
06:13:15.030 --> 06:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
you very much uh I wanted to I'm glad
 
06:13:16.548 --> 06:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
representative Murray asked the question
 
06:13:19.030 --> 06:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
she asked and I I was going to to say
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
that it looks hopk content it sounds
 
06:13:21.948 --> 06:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
like it's about a quarter of the size of
 
06:13:23.510 --> 06:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
Kean roughly and I know that one of the
 
06:13:25.670 --> 06:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
problems that we have in Kean is for
 
06:13:27.948 --> 06:13:27.958 align:start position:0%
example with number five plastic and
 
06:13:29.390 --> 06:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
this has to do with this plastic that
 
06:13:31.390 --> 06:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
you get stuck with so right you can
 
06:13:33.190 --> 06:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
advertise if you're cuing you can
 
06:13:35.110 --> 06:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
advertise that these K cups are
 
06:13:37.708 --> 06:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
recyclable but this is also where we get
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
into the limitations of the market Keen
 
06:13:42.468 --> 06:13:42.478 align:start position:0%
at four times the size of Hopkin can
 
06:13:45.430 --> 06:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton can't gather enough number
 
06:13:49.788 --> 06:13:49.798 align:start position:0%
five plastic to make it feasible to sell
 
06:13:52.390 --> 06:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
that plastic so theoretically there's a
 
06:13:54.590 --> 06:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
market but in reality there isn't a
 
06:13:56.948 --> 06:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
market this is recyclable it ends up in
 
06:13:58.830 --> 06:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
a landfill because of the limitations of
 
06:14:01.548 --> 06:14:01.558 align:start position:0%
the market I can only imagine that that
 
06:14:03.910 --> 06:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
must be even more true for a community
 
06:14:06.190 --> 06:14:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's about a quarter the size of keen
 
06:14:10.590 --> 06:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's exactly true I mean it's
 
06:14:13.270 --> 06:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah number five has been a problem for
 
06:14:15.990 --> 06:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
a long time we actually did we never got
 
06:14:18.390 --> 06:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
revenue from it but we were able to sell
 
06:14:20.948 --> 06:14:20.958 align:start position:0%
it to a company called preserve which
 
06:14:23.110 --> 06:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
makes things like toothbrushes and
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
you'll see things in the grocery store
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
made by preserve um out of that number
 
06:14:27.360 --> 06:14:28.750 align:start position:0%
made by preserve um out of that number
five

06:14:28.750 --> 06:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
five
 
06:14:28.760 --> 06:14:31.788 align:start position:0%
five
polypropylene

06:14:31.788 --> 06:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
um the pro I don't know what happened
 
06:14:37.230 --> 06:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
covid things fell apart with preserve
 
06:14:39.190 --> 06:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
and covid and they never came back so we
 
06:14:41.628 --> 06:14:41.638 align:start position:0%
have not had a vendor to to give our
 
06:14:44.830 --> 06:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
number fives to even though we always
 
06:14:47.948 --> 06:14:47.958 align:start position:0%
had to pay to get rid of it to preserve
 
06:14:51.350 --> 06:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
it was cheaper than paying what it would
 
06:14:53.628 --> 06:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
cost to landfill it so it was still a
 
06:14:56.830 --> 06:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
good deal um
 
06:14:58.070 --> 06:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is one of the problems with the
 
06:15:01.390 --> 06:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
recycling Market it is so volatile it's
 
06:15:04.270 --> 06:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
hard to plan um it's hard to know month
 
06:15:06.350 --> 06:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
to month I mean there are times when we
 
06:15:09.708 --> 06:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
couldn't get rid of cardboard or paper
 
06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
and then people around town are like oh
 
06:15:13.910 --> 06:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
I I heard we can't recycle cardboard
 
06:15:15.750 --> 06:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
anymore you know four months later when
 
06:15:17.708 --> 06:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
the cardboard Market has come back they
 
06:15:19.788 --> 06:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
still think oh I can't recycle cardboard
 
06:15:20.948 --> 06:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
anymore so they're throwing it in the
 
06:15:24.510 --> 06:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
hopper it's just it's so hard thank you
 
06:15:27.030 --> 06:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
very much
 
06:15:28.990 --> 06:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
06:15:31.468 --> 06:15:31.478 align:start position:0%
else no thank you very much for your
 
06:15:31.478 --> 06:15:32.708 align:start position:0%
else no thank you very much for your
testimony

06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:15:36.150 --> 06:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
today and um my apologies to the
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee that uh the day has gone so
 
06:15:41.430 --> 06:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
long but such that it is we've got a lot
 
06:15:45.590 --> 06:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
of uh interesting things that we will be
 
06:15:49.868 --> 06:15:49.878 align:start position:0%
discussing this is why we scheduled this
 
06:15:54.750 --> 06:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
yes um okay so uh with that I guess uh I
 
06:15:57.830 --> 06:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
will VI you oh yeah the blue sheet blue
