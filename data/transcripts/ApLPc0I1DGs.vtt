sure why um but I think the item is
pretty

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
straightforward um the issue was brought
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
to the Department's attention this fall
 
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
when the towns the Two Towns mentioned
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
in the item were starting this um water
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
supply project and they realized that
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
they had an easement with the state for
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
a piece of property that they needed to
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
cross with the water lines and they just
 
00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
were looking to get that that changed I
 
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
believe the commissioner was in contact
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
with uh some members of the committee
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
put forward to do this amendment and
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
