Thank you.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll call the meeting to order.

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is an executive session of the Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee.

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I will first thing, I would like to ask all to rise so we can salute the flag.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Yes, please join me in a pledge to our flag.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:59.500
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, neither the bull, the liberty and justice for all.

16
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Be seated.

17
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
Be seated.

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
All right.

19
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:15.000
First on the agenda is Senate Bill 56 relative to payments of a restoration of certain jurisdictional resource losses.

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And Chair recognizes Representative Lamontagne for a motion.

21
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I make a motion to pass.

22
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Motion to pass.

23
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Is there a second?

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Representative Rung seconds the motion.

25
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Representative Lamontagne, would you like to speak to your motion?

26
00:01:33.500 --> 00:02:06.000
Yes, I have to say when I first looked at the bill, I thought that we shouldn't make it easier not to get the important work done and to allow lieu of payment but after hearing more testimony about it I understand it's it would make it much more effective to get some of these impact projects done and sort of expedite that whole process.

27
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Representative Rung, would you like to speak to your second?

28
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Thank you, Mr.

29
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Chair.

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:37.500
I ditto what Representative LaMontagne said, but also it was clear from the testimony from DOT, DES, and the New Hampshire General Contractors Association that watershed renewal programs or repair programs will actually be of a higher quality with this program than they would otherwise.

31
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.500
Thank you very much.

32
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Anyone else wish to speak on the motion?

33
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.000
Seeing none, on Senate Bill 56, the motion ought to pass.

34
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.500
Will the clerk please call the roll?

35
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.500
Thank you, Chair.

36
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000

Representative Lamontagne?

59
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Yes.

60
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Representative Lovett?

61
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.500
Yes, but it's Representative Howard.

62
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.500
Okay, that's...

63
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.500
Okay.

64
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.500
Okay.

65
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.500
And Representative Ryan?

66
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.500

73
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.500
Okay.

76
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.500
It's consent.

77
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.000
I'm going to skip over 60 at the moment.

78
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We are waiting for an amendment on it.

79
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So the next two you've got to skip.

80
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Okay.

81
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Skip to the third.

82
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
All right.

83
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Well, okay.

84
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Then another skip.

85
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We've got to do an amendment for 160 as well.

86
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And let's get through the 164 and 229.

87
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Okay, well, first I'd like to recognize Representative Howard and you're replacing Representative Lovett.

88
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Thank you very much.

89
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
All right, well, Senate Bill, let's go to Senate Bill 164, and I apologize.

90
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000
It's relative to consideration of biodiversity in the land and community heritage investment program.

91
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.500
I recognize Representative Harb for a motion.

92
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500
Thank you, Mr.

93
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.500
Chair.

94
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.500
I'd make a motion inexpedient to legislate on SB 164.

95
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.000
Do I have a second?

96
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Representative Rung seconds.

97
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Representative Harb, would you like to speak to your motion?

98
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Yes, thank you, Chair.

99
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.500
Just very briefly, I think this bill would cause more problems than it would solve, and I don't think it's necessary.

100
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.000
So that's why I move to ITL.

101
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Representative Runk, would you like to?

102
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Yeah, I just think it needs a little more work.

103
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I know during testimony, it was brought out that it doesn't include some of life species like fungi and algae.

104
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.500
And so, I think it just needs a little more work.

105
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:32.500
Is there anyone else who would like to speak to the motion of ITL.

106
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.500
Representative Vail.

107
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.500
Thank you, Mr.

108
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.500
Chair.

109
00:06:38.500 --> 00:07:00.500
I actually think this is a great concept, and I like that we are looking to consider biodiversity in LCHIP, but I also feel that we have a board of directors in Elchip, and I did not hear them weighing in as a group.

110
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:12.000
And so for that reason, I think, and for the reason that it doesn't include all the species and maybe phylums and genres.

111
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So thank you so much for bringing this forward, but at this point, I think it's not ready.

112
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Thank you.

113
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.500
Is there anyone else who wishes to speak on the motion of ITL?

114
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500
Seeing none.

115
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.000
Motion on Senate Bill 164.

116

Representative McHugh?

128
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.500
Yes.

129
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.500
Representative Donnelly?

130
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.500
Yes.

131
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.500
Representative Dunn?

132
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.500
Yes.

133
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.500
Representative Vail?

134
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.500
Yes.

135
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.500
Representative Wrong?

136
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.500
Yes.

137
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.500
Representative Kelly?

138
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.500
Yes.

Representative Simpson?

140
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.500

Representative Baldwin?

142
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500

Representative Darby?

144
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.500

Okay.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.500
The vote is 16 to 4.

157
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.500
The vote passes.

158
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.500
All right.

159
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:19.000
Obviously, that's not going to be on the – let's see.

160
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.500
Is there – is there going to be a – I will be writing the blurb on the motion.

and is there anyone who will be writing the of a minority and is there anyone who will be writing a minority report?

162
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Yes, it sounds like there will be a minority report.

163
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Can we get back to you about which one of us will write that?

164
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Yeah.

165
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Sometime today.

Okay, great.

168
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Thanks.

169
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Because I do have to get these in.

170
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Okay.

171
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
we're finished on 164.

172
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:22.500
And we'll go to House Bill, assuming Senate Bill 229, relative to administration of certain wetland permits by the Department of Environmental Services.

173
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.000
And Representative Donnelly, for motion.

174
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.500
I'd like to make a motion, Mr.

175
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.000
Chair, to ought to pass.

176
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.500
Motion I'll ought to pass.

177
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.500
Is there a second?

178
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.500
Second by Representative Healy.

179
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.500
Would you like to speak to your motion, Representative Donnelly?

180
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

181
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Chair.

182
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:55.500
Yes, I believe that this would simplify some of the things that are needed in certain wetland permitting.

183
00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:06.000
And also, as DES pointed out, that the domestic sewage with single-family dwellings would be a better way of managing this.

184
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.500

248
00:13:44.000 --> 00:14:01.000

249
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.500
So does it have to go on the regular calendar, Mr.

250
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.500
Chair?

251
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:17.500
I don't believe so because even though it was a fiscal note, it was not an early bill.

252
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.500
Oh, okay.

253
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.500

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500
Okay, thank you.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.000

Okay.

259
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.500
All right.

260
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.500
We are waiting for amendments on two bills.

261
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.500
Okay.

262
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.500

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.500
Thank you.

272
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.500
Thank you.

273
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.500
Thank you.

274
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:15.500
And I'd like to do, we have the amendment now for Senate Bill 160.

275
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.500
Yes, Senate Bill 160.

276
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:28.000
and first I'll accept the motions of of of of First, I'll accept the motion of ought to pass, Representative Vail.

277
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.500
I move ought to pass on Senate Bill 160.

278
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.500
And you also, do you have an amendment?

279
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.500
Yes, Mr.

280
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.500
Chair.

281
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:47.000
And further, I would like to introduce amendment 1519H to Senate Bill 160.

282
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.500
I did make an error in that I needed a second on ought to pass.

283
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.500
Representative Rung seconds ought to pass.

284
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:04.500
We'll go into the amendment now and then other discussion on ought to pass.

285
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.000
We're going to move the amendment first.

286
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.500
This is on amendment, is it 1519?

287
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.500
Yes, Mr.

288
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.500
Chair.

289
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.500
And is there a second on the amendment?

290
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.500
Representative Darby, I haven't heard from him yet.

291
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.500
Shocking, right?

292
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.500
What have you, a large item?

293
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.000
I second the amendment 1519H.

294
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Thank you.

295
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Representative Vail, would you like to speak to your amendment?

296
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Yes, I would, Mr.

297
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Chair.

298
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
This is a very simple amendment.

299
00:16:45.000 --> 00:17:10.500
It says to amend the title of the bill by replacing it with relative to the use of OHRVs on designated trails and it also deletes section 3 and renumbers the original section 4 to read as 3 and I'll tell you the reason why we look to get this amended.

300
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:19.500
I think in the testimony that we heard that the first part of the bill is super important.

301
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:32.500
It's causing a lot of problems and we want to make sure that fishing game has relief and that the people in the area also do.

302
00:17:32.500 --> 00:18:29.500
And I believe that that part of the bill was consistent with the Commission the OHRV 1188 Commission that has been meeting I think they've had four meetings so far so for the amendment the reason basically is with that 1188 Commission we really I we don't want to step on toes I think as a committee we need to let that Commission do its work and we need them to where they came to us without a position on the bill and they had concerns as well as a lot of information to share that we should let that commission with all of the stakeholders present go through that part of the bill.

303
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:38.000
So I'm asking for people to vote with me on to pass as amended on this bill.

304
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Thank you, Mr.

305
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Chair.

306
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Thank you.

307
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Representative Brown, would you like to speak to your second?

308
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.500
No, I think Senator Vail, Representative Vail did a great job.

309
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.000
I'm giving you a promotion.

310
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Anyone else like to speak to the bill?

311
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I will speak to the amendment.

312
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Okay.

313
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.500

314
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.500
Okay.

315
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500

316
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.500
Representative Harb.

317
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.500
Yes.

318
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.500
Representative R Howard?

319
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.500
Yes.

320
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.500
Representative Hoyt.

321
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.500
Yes.

322
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.500
Representative LaMontagne.

323
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500
Yes.

324
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.500
Representative Howard.

325
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.500
Yes.

326
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.500
Representative Ryan.

327
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.500
Yes.

328
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.500
Representative Renzullo.

329
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.500
Yes.

330
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.500
That's 20 to 0.

331
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.000
On the ought to pass as amended.

332
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Representative Vail, would you like to speak to your motion?

333
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.500
I really don't have anything further to add, Mr.

334
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.500
Chair.

335
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.500
Representative Rung, would you like to speak to...

336
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.000
Yeah, I thought Representative Darby, I forget which second he had.

337
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.500
Sorry, I let him have a shot.

338
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:39.000
I think Representative Bale expressed my concerns that eliminating the Montana loophole to get ahead of OHRVs on roads where they're not currently permitted is important, yet the clauses from Section 3 haven't been appropriately studied yet, so the OHRB committee should study those before we vote on them.

339
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So I'd urge the committee to vote OTPA.

340
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Thank you.

341
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Is there anyone else who wishes to speak on the motion about to pass as amended?

342
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.500
Seeing none, will the clerk please call the roll on Senate Bill 160?

343
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.500
Okay.

344
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.500
Thank you.

345
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.500
Representative Harb?

346
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.500
Yes.

347
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.500

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.500
Representative Baldwin.

370
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.500
Yes.

371
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.500
Representative Baldwin.

372
00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.500
Yes.

373
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.500
Thank you.

374
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.500
Yes.

375
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.500
Representative Kelly.

376
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.500
Yes.

377
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.500
Representative Simpson.

378
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.500
Yes.

379
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.500
Representative Baldwin.

380
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.500
Yes.

381
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.500
Representative Darby.

382
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.500
Yes.

383
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.500
Representative Hoyt.

384
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.500
Yes.

385
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.500
Representative Lamontagne.

386
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.500
Yes.

387
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.500
Representative Howard.

388
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.500
Yes.

389
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.500
Representative Ryan.

390
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.500
Yes.

391
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500
And Representative Prince-Elo.

392
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.500
Yes.

393
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.500
20 to zero.

394
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.500
Okay.

395
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.500
Having passed, that's 20 to nothing.

396
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.500
Consent?

397
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.500
Non-consent?

398
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.000
Oppose the hearing on Senate Bill 160.

399
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.500
I guess we have an amendment on 60, Senate Bill 60, which we are also waiting for.

400
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.500
And it may be passed out.

401
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.500
Thank you.

402
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.500
Okay.

403
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.500
Okay.

404
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.000
I'll let folks look at it for a minute.

405
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
The – Okay.

406
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:30.000
The, you want to, why don't I open up discussion so you can explain, you want to explain all of the, what's in it?

407
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Exactly.

408
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.500
I'm just looking for one.

409
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.500
All right.

410
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.500
Yeah.

411
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.500
Yes.

412
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.500
Oh.

413
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.000
You get your thing on.

414
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Oh.

415
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Okay.

416
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
All right.

417
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I'll open the discussion.

418
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.500
This is an amendment that we just had a correction on.

419
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.000
We had a work session with Mr.

420
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.500
Deers, who helped us work through it.

421
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.500
is this is an omnibus amendment.

422
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:14.000
So there was some things that we needed to be clarified.

423
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And that since I'm going to ask Mr.

424
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.500
Dears if he'd like to.

425
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:33.500
Well, if you want to speak to just a sec, just one or, you know, just a little bit about what it is on this amendment.

426
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:48.000
And so we had your input on it, but I think there's some people who might have been missing that and might have been missing what you have here.

427
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Sorry to pull you in, but you're good at this.

428
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
No, no, I'm not.

429
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
We don't have a motion on the floor.

430
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Well, I don't know.

431
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I don't think I have to do any motion yet.

432
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Just taking information.

433
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Great.

434
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.500
Thank you for the record.

435
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.000
My name is Ted Deers.

436
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I'm the Assistant Director of the Water Division at the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services.

437
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Thank you.

438
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.500
I appreciate the fluttering about of papers here on this bill this morning.

439
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:44.000
It is, as we spoke about last time at the work session, it took a little bit to work through the whole, all these provisions.

440
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
The provisions themselves end up being very simple.

441
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:59.500
We talked last time about that most of these really are putting some of what would be kind of rule-type things in statute.

442
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.500
That was something Mr.

443
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:13.500
McGue was interested in, and we had that conversation, and you'll see that those are the kinds of things that have been added in.

444
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:25.500
We talked about timeframes, and one of the things about timeframes was making sure that people had adequate opportunity to be able to respond.

445
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:37.500
And so I think Representative Harb and others had some good ideas about adding some additional time for people to be able to respond.

446
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:43.000
So those have been added into this amendment after that discussion.

447
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And I think those were the primary pieces that ended up being part of the bill.

448
00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:05.500
we had a good discussion I think about the last provision which was somewhat complicated to understand relative to how we calculate nutrient effluent criteria for wastewater treatment plants.

449
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.000
I think that was a fruitful conversation.

450
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:19.000
I think everybody kind of came around to understanding how that works and why this is important to provide flexibility.

451
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:35.500
And I had provided some rule language that would go along with that particular provision at the last time, which showed how we would address that in our rules based on the statute.

452
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.500
I think that those were the primary activities.

453
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:51.500
I also sent around to you a quick summary that went through each of the provisions that should have gone out in your email.

454
00:27:51.500 --> 00:28:03.000
And that was sort of the beginnings of maybe a blurb at some point if we can get around to that here today.

455
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And I'm happy to help out in any way on writing that.

456
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
There are a fair number of provisions here.

457
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:32.000
So I would just say that while we're in informational session, if the chair is okay with it, I'd be happy to entertain any questions and be happy to explain further where we ended up with the amendment.

458
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Representative Vail.

459
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Thank you, Mr.

460
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Chair.

461
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I have a summary of the bill that I could run by you, and that would be appropriate.

462
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.500
So I have Senate Bill 60 filed at the request of the department.

463
00:28:53.500 --> 00:29:00.000
Well, now you're getting into – maybe I should call this to order.

464
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Yeah.

465
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:13.000
I think we're getting into some testimony, which I think we can accept, which we should accept as part of the hearing.

466
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Pardon?

467
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.500
She doesn't have any questions.

468
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.500
Yeah.

469
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.500
Well, do you have any question of him?

470
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.500
Okay, actually, she doesn't have any.

471
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.500
Does anyone else have any questions of Mr.

472
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.500
Dears?

473
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.500
Seeing none, I guess I have no questions.

474
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.500
Let me open the hearing then on the executive session.

475
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.500
Thank you very much.

476
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:50.000
If you have any questions during the session, I'll be here and available.

477
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Thank you.

478
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Thank you.

479
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.500
All right, opening the hearing on the executive session for Senate Bill 60.

480
00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:05.000
And the chair recognizes Representative Vail for a motion.

481
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.500
I move on to pass.

482
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.000
Motion of ought to pass.

483
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.500
Do I have a second?

484
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.500
Representative Darby?

485
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:20.000
I second the motion ought to pass on Senate Bill 60.

486
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Okay.

487
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
We'll go right to the amendment.

488
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
You have an amendment.

489
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
I move ought to pass on Amendment 1635H.

490
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Amendment 1635H.

491
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.500
So I hear a second.

492
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.500
Representative Darby.

493
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:43.500
I second the motion to amend Senate Bill 60 with Amendment 1635H.

494
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:48.500
Representative Vail, would you like to speak to your amendment?

495
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500
Yes, I would.

496
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:59.500
And I did write something up that I'm hoping describes the bill as well as possible as amended.

497
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:09.500
The bill makes changes to existing statutes that clarify responsibilities of DES and ensuring compliance with federal water quality standards.

498
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:25.000
And the bill also establishes processing times for requests for certifications, defines the time period for acting on federally required certifications, and sets public notice and hearing requirements for certification requests.

499
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Additionally, the bill clarifies the requirement for water conservation for both large surface water and groundwater withdrawals, and it removes language that prohibits the use of flow statistics 7Q10 in the calculation of nutrient effluent limits from wastewater treatment plants.

500
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Furthermore, I have section by section which RSAs get changed, but I will spare you unless you would like to hear more about that.

501
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Thank you, Mr.

502
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Chair.

503
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Thank you.

504
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:12.000
That was on the bill itself, but the amendment is just clarification of segments of the original bill?

505
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Yes, that is the case, Mr.

506
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Chair.

507
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:29.000
They're mostly just small tweaks and things that we felt would add confusion versus the clarifications that this bill and amendment seek to make.

508
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.500
Representative Darby on the amendment.

509
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500
Thank you, Mr.

510
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.500
Chair.

511
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.500
Yes, I agree.

512
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.000
I concur with Representative Vail.

513
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.000
There was a couple of minor clarifications for some inconsistencies that were clarified in the amendment.

514
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.500
And it's as we discussed during the work session.

515
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.500
Anyone else wish to speak on the amendment?

516
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:03.500
On Amendment 1635 for Senate Bill 60, will the clerk please call the roll?

517
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.500
Yes.

518
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.500
Representative Harb.

519
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.500
Yes.

520
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.500
Representative Goulds.

521
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.500
Yes.

522
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.500
Representative Horgan.

523
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.500
Yes.

524
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.500
Clerk votes yes.

525
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.500
Representative Healy.

526
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.500
Yes.

527
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.500
Representative Goulds.

528
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.500
Yes.

529
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.500
Representative Horgan.

530
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.500
Yes.

531
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.500
Clerk votes yes.

532
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.500
Representative Healy.

533
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.500
Yes.

534
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.500
Representative Wolfe.

535
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.500
Yes.

536
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.500
Representative McHugh.

537
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.500
Yes.

538
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.500
Representative Donnelly.

539
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.500
Yes.

540
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.500
Representative Dunn.

541
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.500
Yes.

542
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.500
Representative Vail.

543
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.500
Yes.

544
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.500
Representative Rung.

545
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:01.500
Yes.

546

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.500

573
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.500

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.500

575
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.500
Thank you.

576
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:14.000
Representative Darby, on your second, do you have any additional comments?

577
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:26.500
I'll just state briefly that the amended bill makes a number of important refinements to existing water quality statutes to increase flexibility without risking safety.

578
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:42.000
In particular, things that are important are adding public hearings for water withdrawal certification requests and correcting the statute references for rules regarding large water withdrawals under the Clean Water Act.

579
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:51.500
And so I urge the committee to vote ought to pass as amended on House Bill 60 as amended.

580
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.500
Thank you.

581
00:35:53.500 --> 00:36:00.500
Anyone else wish to speak on the motion of ought to pass as amended?

582
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.500
Seeing no one, will the clerk please call the roll?

583
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.500

642
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.500
Okay.

643
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.500
Well, yes for consent.

644
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:18.000
Is there any more business we need to take up at this time?

645
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
I think we've gotten the five bills that were on the agenda.

646
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.500
We do have a work session this afternoon at 2 o'clock.

647
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:35.500
I guess it's a long lunch unless we want to discuss something.

648
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.500
Representative Rugg.

649
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.500
Thank you, Mr.

650
00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:41.500
Chair.

651
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:47.500
I also see we have a work session scheduled on May 10th.

652
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.500
Yep.

653
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.500
And that's also on Senate Bill 11, correct?

654
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.500
Yep.

655
00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:01.500
So I was just wondering why we were having two work sessions.

656
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.500
Because we may need a third.

657
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:07.500
We may need a third one.

658
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.500
This is the second year for this bill.

659
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:18.500
and so I can always erase This is the second year for this bill.

660
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:22.000
And so I can always erase that.

661
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.500
But I don't see us coming to a conclusion at the end of our work session today.

662
00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:45.500
if we do come to a conclusion, we still have to work out, well, we still have to come to a point where we will have to exact the bill.

663
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.500
We could change that.

664
00:39:47.500 --> 00:40:28.500
Again, I can always cross things out and write something else in no i i just um so you know i the history of the bill is it was voted interim study and voted recommended to bring back so there's already been some work on this bill from last year that's why i was wondering why we needed multiple work sessions on it but if you read read the interim study, there was division in how the bill should finally come out.

665
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:37.500
There was agreement on a probable need, but there was not agreement on how it would finally look.

666
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:43.500
There was general agreement, but we need to work some things out.

667
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.500
A lot of things.

668
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.500
Thank you, Mr.

669
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.500
Chair.

670
00:40:49.500 --> 00:41:03.000
Do I understand that if we do come to some kind of resolution today, you'd be able to perhaps change that work session into an exec session?

671
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.500
No, I cannot do that.

672
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:10.500
That needs, would need, the full requirement of a hearing.

673
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:15.500
Not a hearing, of a published notice for an executive.

674
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:23.000
right my question was was, what's the deadline for that public hearing for next Wednesday?

675
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Today.

676
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Okay.

677
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
We might have a consecutive session next Wednesday.

678
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Well, no, I didn't say that.

679
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
That was my question.

680
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.500
Next Wednesday, we don't have an executive session for next Wednesday.

681
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.500
We have a work session for next Wednesday.

682
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:54.000
Could that, if we finish up today, could that work session be changed to an executive session?

683
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
It's before Thursday.

684
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Well, I think if I had to do that, I would have to do it on the floor tomorrow to change it.

685
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Pardon?

686
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:29.500
Can you go in the next half an hour and add, don't delete, but add the exec session on the same bill the same day we have the work session so we could follow the work and then go to exec?

687
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.500
We could.

688
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:38.000
Somebody told me you might have a half an hour to do that.

689
00:42:38.000 --> 00:43:04.500
I don't know timing yeah that's that way we have it both if we need the work session we have it if we need to continue the exec we can continue it but if we work it all out we could finish it that day i don't know gee my arm gets twisted.

690
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.500
Oh, good.

691
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.500
Mr.

692
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.000
Chairman, you have until 3 o'clock today.

693
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
You have until 3 o'clock today to put it in the calendar.

694
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.000
But I would have to get it to the person in front of 12.

695
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.500
That's the agreement with the – actually, it's 11, 15, 12 and 1.

696
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:39.000
that's the agreement with you can get that that is the agreement that you have.

697
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Oh, 1 o'clock for committee services?

698
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Yep.

699
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.500
Or with the agreement of the ranking member, we could do exec session anytime, right?

700
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:58.000
Not out of a – I think not out of a work session.

701
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
I think out of a hearing.

702
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Not out of a not I think we're not out of a work session.

703
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
I think out of a hearing.

704
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Not out of a work session.

705
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
I could check with the clerk on that, but I would think.

706
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
I wouldn't agree to it anyway.

707
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:36.500
I want to go right to the end from the fourth I'll have it put on unfortunately what's going to happen if you have it put on.

708
00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:48.500
Unfortunately, what's going to happen, if you have it put on, people are going to come and expect to have it taken care of.

709
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:55.500
So at any rate, if you put it on, you can take it off.

710
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.500
Oh.

711
00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.500
It can be canceled.

712
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.500
I can cancel it.

713
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:13.000
Yeah, so if you put it on and then we see what happens this afternoon, it looks like, no, it ain't going anywhere.

714
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
We need a lot more work.

715
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.500
You can take it off.

716
00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:23.000
If you don't put it on, we're another day.

717
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
People do keep track.

718
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Just a suggestion.

719
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Yeah, that's true.

720
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.500
Hey, who's running this place?

721
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.500
Who's running this place?

722
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.000
You're running it with some good suggestions.

723
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
I don't blame you.

724
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Thank you, Mr.

725
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Chair.

726
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Yeah, I agree with my colleague from Newbury.

727
00:45:47.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I think add the executive session, because if it takes us two work sessions and we don't have consensus, I don't think adding a third work session is going to do it.

728
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.500
We're just going to have to bring it to a vote.

729
00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.500
That's on, Mr.

730
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.000
Chairman, on Senate Bill 11?

731
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Oh, I haven't.

732
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Really?

733
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Okay.

734
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
I thought we were going to maybe be unanimous on that one.

735
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.500
I guess we'll wait to get today's work session.

736
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.500
Okay.

737
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.500
I'll put in another.

738
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:41.000
I'll to be, if this was the last session, I could call it right away.

739
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
It used to be that way in the last session.

740
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.500
I just want to punish it for taking away my powers.

741
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.000
This is the last session.

742
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Let's let them go.

743
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Just kidding.

744
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
I'll put it.

745
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Oh, thank you.

746
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Thank you, Mr.

747
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Chair.

748
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I do have another matter to bring up.

749
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000
You only got one.

750
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
That one wasn't mine.

751
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Just that you had mentioned something about moving on to the retained bills and at what point we would be able to do that.

752
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
And the committee of conference season is over for us.

753
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.500
Can you use the microphone?

754
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.000
Oh, not everybody can hear.

755
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:50.500
It was discussed at the chair's meeting that once we, into June, we can work on retained bills, especially if we don't have a lot of committee conference issues.

756
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:56.000
Some committees have a lot of bills going back and forth.

757
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
I think we will have one.

758
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.500
I think we just got one ourselves here today.

759
00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:07.500
But I don't think we have that many.

760
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:15.500
So we can work on the builds that we have retained on the month of June.

761
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:24.000
The only issue is you can get the work done, but you can't dispose of the stuff.

762
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:37.500
It has to go to November when you have your final vote, and then it goes to the final vote is, I guess, the first in November.

763
00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.500
So you have to.

764
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.500
But you can have the hearings.

765
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.000
you can have the hearings.

766
00:48:45.000 --> 00:49:00.500
You can do all, you can, you can have the, uh, the sessions and you can, you can come to an agreement and you can, you can even take your vote.

767
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:08.500
It's just that you can't have, uh, you can't, it doesn't, it doesn't get disposed of.

768
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.500
Don't go back to the House.

769
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.500
Don't go back to the House.

770
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.500
So we can vote.

771
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.500
Yeah.

772
00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.500
But so we can clean if we're good about it.

773
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:31.000
And I know we have a couple of bills that we retain simply by request.

774
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:51.000
to I think there was a couple of bills like that that we're going to we said we were going to not pass but we were retained by request by the people who by the sponsors and we agreed agree.

775
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.500
So we can do that.

776
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:58.500
So, yeah, I had planned on doing that during June.

777
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:02.500
Would we schedule work sessions for those bills?

778
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:06.000
We could do it as work session.

779
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:15.000
I think we can do it as work session, but we'd probably have to have a public session.

780
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Well, they're public anyway.

781
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Right.

782
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
But if we have to do any disposition.

783
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Then he's got to be scheduled again for a vote.

784
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.500
He's got to be scheduled as a work session.

785
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.500
But we can't vote until November.

786
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:42.000
No, we vote in the committee and then get it off our plate.

787
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000
It doesn't go to the House for the House to vote on.

788
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Thank you.

789
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
But we can't vote until November.

790
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:59.500
No, we vote in the committee and then get it off our plate.

791
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:05.500
It doesn't go to the House for the House to vote on.

792
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.500
Every bill has to go to the House.

793
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:16.500
We vote on it here, but it doesn't go to the House until November.

794
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.500
We'll work on it.

795
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.500
We'll figure it out.

796
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:30.000
I just have one more process question, and that's about the committees of conference or the bills coming back.

797
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.000
So for the newer people, our bills went over to the Senate.

798
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.500
They did what they did.

799
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:52.500
And did they come back to you for you to look at the changes they might have made to whether or not we would concede to their changes?

800
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.500
Yes.

801
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.000
If you could walk us through that.

802
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.500
I'd be a fool to do it by myself.

803
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.500
I didn't know what you meant.

804
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.500
But you could.

805
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:12.500
I could if I wanted, but you don't do that.

806
00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:18.000
I mean, it's within the authority, but it's not very smart.

807
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:26.000
So what usually is done is if, like, if you're having a session, bring it up.

808
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:52.500
Or a lot of times I'll get that information sometimes on the day of a hearing, excuse me, of a session day, and I'll'll just find people and get their thoughts yeah excuse me I only have three things to do it's either concur non-concur or non-concur and ask for a committee conference.

809
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:57.000
So, it's a concur, but usually it's a concur.

810
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.500
So I would ask people, just basically, and get a consensus.

811
00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.500
All right.

812
00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:08.500
I would get a consensus from the, yeah.

813
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.000
Usually, because it's pretty normal.

814
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:23.000
And then on a committee of conference, I have to recommend people to the speaker, and he will, usually follows who I would recommend.

815
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Requirement is that you have had to have voted for the House position on the bill.

816
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Thank you so much for going over that.

817
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:54.000
I do remember just coming, we are coming in and we're having a hearing or we're having a work session or for some reason meeting and hearing about the bills coming back one by one as they do.

818
00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:00.000
So we'll just take this as it goes and learn from it.

819
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:16.500
Should be pretty to see what's going to happen yeah you'll get sent messages thank you so much for covering those things I just have one more thing if you'll indulge me Mr..

820
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.500
Chair.

821
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:20.500
Go ahead.

822
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:23.500
Four follow-ups is definitely my limit.

823
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:29.500
Just to, we really need to be careful to use our microphones.

824
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:40.000
When I went back to look at all the hearings on SB11, I saw that we could not hear my voice.

825
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:55.500
Now, I know enough about this equipment to understand how it works, and I know that I need to have it right in front of me for people to hear me.

826
00:54:55.500 --> 00:55:11.000
I think I'm speaking into it but I know that there are members in here have hearing impairments and they are not hearing everything and that is deeply disturbing to me.

827
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:50.500
So I hope that we'll all take time to practice with our microphones and make sure that every word that we say is being said into it um i know that with hearing aids and devices that when you turn them up as far as they will go you hear every rustle of paper and it can be excruciating and exhausting so let's just try to be the best at this i think all committees struggle with the equipment.

828
00:55:50.500 --> 00:56:01.000
That is true, but I think their equipment now is head and shoulders better than what we had during last session.

829
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:08.500
It was disaster, especially when you had half the place was coming in on screen.

830
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.000
And it was all Zoom.

831
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.500
And we didn't have this many microphones.

832
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:24.000
So I think, I mean, usually it's pretty good, the ones I've heard for now, but not like me.

833
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
I have a tendency to leave this off.

834
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
And I lean back.

835
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
All right.

836
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Anything else?

837
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Questions?

838
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.000

Five minutes of two.

840
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Five?

841
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Yeah.

Thank you.

984
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:34.500
make a statement or however you want to do it.

985
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.000
We're in a work session.

986
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.500
It's all, you know, kind of just whatever works.

987
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.500
Yeah, you should.

988
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:47.000
Thank you, Chairman Renzullo and committee members.

989
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.500
We don't really have an opening statement.

990
01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500
Again, I'm Ben Wilson.

991
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:57.000
I'm the director of the Division of Historical Resources.

992
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.500
And within our division, we house the state archaeologists.

993
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.500
The state archaeologists.

994
01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:09.500
So I'd like to introduce Mark Doporowski, who is our state archaeologist.

995
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:22.000
And he's actually the professional when it comes to these issues of unmarked graves and remains and the processes involved and that sort of thing.

996
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:34.000
So I think we could, if the committee just wanted to ask questions, we'll do our best to answer them and go from there.

997
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:46.500
If I'm not mistaken, Representative Vail, you, the last time I think you asked some very, you started us off with a very interesting question.

998
01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.500
Would you like to say it for you?

999
01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.000
or would you like to?

1000
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Please, Mr.

1001
01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Chair, if you would indulge me to go ahead and do that for me we talked about a lot of different things thank you I think it was basically if you're walking out in your backyard and you step on a skull, what happens?

1002
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Where do you go from there?

1003
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
There's a whole lot of information.

1004
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:33.500
There's a whole lot of procedure that goes on, some of which I think eventually ends up relative to this bill.

1005
01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:41.500
So you could just give us an idea of what happens when you find the skull.

1006
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:45.000
So first you try not to scream.

1007
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Yeah.

1008
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And don't break it.

1009
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.000
But I'm going to turn that question over to the state archaeologists.

1010
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Okay.

1011
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So upon finding human remains, you call the local police.

1012
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Usually state law enforcement will respond, but ultimately the medical examiner's office is in charge until the remains are either determined to be part of a homicide or a crime.

1013
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.500
They stay with the medical examiner's office.

1014
01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:31.500
If they're found to be of historical nature and there's no fall to play, they come, they're notified, our office is notified.

1015
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.500
So that's the process.

1016
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:41.000
If you find human remains of any sort, you definitely call your local law enforcement.

1017
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.500
They'll take it from there.

1018
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:51.000
Okay, now, if you find that it is of a historical nature, Here we go.

1019
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.500
Okay, now, if you find that it is of a historical nature, what happens then?

1020
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:22.500
So that's when our office comes into the picture, and what's going to happen there is the process of, first and foremost, we're going to recommend that the human remains are preserved in place, which means whatever you dug up already, you put back and you preserve it.

1021
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.000
Some cases, you can't do that, right?

1022
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.500
So there's a road project that has to go through or something else like that.

1023
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:49.500
In that case, the remains need to be, after consultation with the community that the remains belong to, if it's possible to identify them, they go through a process of a consultation.

1024
01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.500
It's a lawn-drawn process.

1025
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:55.000
Eventually, the remains will be excavated out.

1026
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:05.000
They'll be appropriately treated and ultimately repatriated in consultation again with the local community or the community, the dissentant community.

1027
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:52.500
there's some things in here though that just to bring up it's not a matter of that when you find human remains as part of a construction project it gets shut down period that's that so some of the language in here is a little inconsistent with the actual procedures it's not a quick moving thing if I'm explaining that correctly to you I hope I'm explaining that in a way you can understand it's not something that just you call the, they notify me and we got to corrode there and excavate the remains.

1028
01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.000
That's not how it happens.

1029
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.500
Well, I don't want to take away I don't want to have me ask all the questions.

1030
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.500
Do any other people who Thank you, Mr.

1031
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.500
Chairman.

1032
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1033
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:15.500
I think that Thank you, Mr.

1034
01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500
Chairman.

1035
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1036
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:29.000
I think that Chairman Renzullo was pushing it to the limit when he talked about a skull.

1037
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.500
But what happens if you come across something else that may be historic?

1038
01:07:35.500 --> 01:08:06.000
And how do you know that it's historic you're not speaking of human remains then no not necessarily just a artifact completely depends on the context so if it's a private property owner is digging in his backyard and he finds a stone tool that's 3 000 years old nothing there's no unless there's a permit involved there's's really no regulation.

1039
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Okay.

1040
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Thank you, Mr.

1041
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Chairman.

1042
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Thank you for taking my question.

1043
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:24.500
Just kind of reframe the discussion again, because I think at one point you were referring to current law.

1044
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:32.500
And at one point you were referring to the piece of legislation in front of us.

1045
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:42.500
So can you just be clear in your response when you're referring to what currently happens, current process, current statute?

1046
01:08:42.500 --> 01:09:04.500
So I think the chairman was asking, can you walk us through what happens now under current statute, current process, when there's any kind of project somebody's putting in a pool or there's a road project and human remains of any kind is uncovered.

1047
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500
Sure.

1048
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:11.500
When human remains are uncovered, it doesn't matter what the...

1049
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500
Okay.

1050
01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:21.000
So I believe I understood you to say that you, of course, notify local authorities.

1051
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.500
It's under the jurisdiction of the ME.

1052
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:40.000
They make the determination if it's part of a crime, and they then determine whether it's historical and then hand off to you and the process you outlined, you already outlined.

1053
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.500
And that's current law or remains of any origin.

1054
01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.500
I would just add a caveat to that.

1055
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:54.500
The ME's office does the best they can to make the determination.

1056
01:09:54.500 --> 01:10:05.000
Sometimes they have to consult with us or another specialist, sometimes at UNH or another university, to really make that determination.

1057
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:20.500
And there has been cases where they turn that case over as being historic, and then we throw it back to them saying, after some additional analysis, but no, it's not.

1058
01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:25.500
So there is sometimes a little bit back and forth.

1059
01:10:25.500 --> 01:12:16.500
But overall the the process you described is accurate law enforcement emmy's office when the termination is made as historic then it comes to us further question all right so to be clear that's all in current statute regardless of the type of historical remains or the origin species or otherwise right if it has to do with human remains and so separately then can you comment on the legislation in front of us what what that does because i you you i saw you looking at it you were starting to refer to that right we'd like to separately talk about that right so even even if so as an archaeologist if i'm doing an excavation and i run into human remains it gets shut down there's no there's no um um there's no allowances for oh well you're an archaeologist doing this you can continue to excavate these human remains as long as you notify the state archaeologists that that's not how it currently works if human remains are discovered no matter what you're doing whether you're digging a pool in your backyard or it's a big highway project or it's an academic study human remains shut a project down until there's an additional investigation that occurs current law okay thank you uh mr chair thank you for taking question.

1060
01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:25.000
So let's talk about the part then once you've decided they are historic remains and need disposition.

1061
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I think you're referring to the process that's in 227C8A through G in general.

1062
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:42.500
And it seems like there's a case called out for Native Americans, and then there's another general case for other individuals.

1063
01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:52.500
And I was wondering if you could talk about the other individual's case and what you do in that case.

1064
01:12:52.500 --> 01:13:10.000
The only real difference between other individuals and Native Americans is that with Native Americans, there's federal law as well that we have to adhere to, NAGPRA, the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act.

1065
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:19.500
But I guess the additional thing is we consult with the descendant community regardless of what the ethnicity is.

1066
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:24.000
With Native Americans, it's usually not an actual family.

1067
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:35.000
For example, if we are dealing with a European-American individual, we'll try and track down that actual family name and the descendants.

1068
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:57.000
We don't have that luxury with a lot of Native American remains, so it's more of a descendant community, and it would be the same for a lot of the African-American remains solely because a lot of these individuals are buried in non-marked graves.

1069
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
For a follow-up.

1070
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Thank you, Mr.

1071
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Chair.

1072
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Thanks for the explanation.

1073
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:29.500
So can you talk about the process that you use now for, again, not Native American remains because, like you said, there is explicit statute compliant with federal law, but the the process you use to track down the, you know, the descendant community or descendants for other people.

1074
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:36.000
Yeah, and again, it's the same process for European Americans and Native Americans.

1075
01:14:36.000 --> 01:15:00.000
It's trying to identify the descendant community, and like I said, with Caucasians, we're usually able, usually able to get a little bit closer to actually like a family name and be able to talk to the next of kin as opposed to just the generic descendant community.

1076
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:07.500
But the process is the same as I outlined once it comes to our office.

1077
01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:18.500
The first thing we're always going to recommend is preservation in place, which is to say, do not excavate the human remains.

1078
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:55.000
Whatever has already been disturbed, put back as carefully carefully as possible and rebury that is always the ultimate goal as far as our department division is concerned like i said there are cases where where that is not possible and again after consultation and identification of the descendant community or the local community or the kin the next of kin they would help make the decision on exactly what's going to happen.

1079
01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:06.000
But like I said, in a lot of cases, if it's a mandated project that's going to happen, they are excavated eventually.

1080
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.000
And again, then it's additional consultation to decide how they're going to be repatriated.

1081
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
John?

1082
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Thank you, Mr.

1083
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Trane.

1084
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Thank you for taking my question.

1085
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:32.000
You mentioned a few minutes ago that there was some discrepancies in the bill that you'd like to see fixed.

1086
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Could you explain what those are?

1087
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I'm not saying they need to be fixed.

1088
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.500
I'm just saying that it does not adhere to the law.

1089
01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:55.000
And personally, I don't think morally it's even if you're an archaeologist doing excavation, you can't just continue digging human remains.

1090
01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.500
That's a little different than the other material that we're excavating.

1091
01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:05.000
Human remains are a special case in my opinion.

1092
01:17:05.000 --> 01:18:39.500
Can you just be a little more specific about what section of the bill you think needs that work the majority of the bill actually talks about academic excavation I would say a lot of it talks about a professional archaeologist excavating a professional archaeologist it's almost on every page So So for example, part 1b, if a professional archaeologist is directing a long-term systematic archaeological research, that is research designed to continue, yada yada, right there on, and it continuously talks about professional archaeologists, professional archaeologists, and specifically what I was saying, part b there, subpart 1, you know, they merely notify the archaeologists and uh specifically what i was saying uh part b there um sub part one you know they merely notify the archaeologists in five five working days to me that that doesn't really mesh with a lot of other notifications and there should be definitely i would i would prefer to see language that says you know all work stops immediately when human remains are discovered all work should stop immediately that's pretty much standard, not just in this state, but across the country.

1093
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:52.500
So, you know, and I may be reading this incorrectly, but it kind of sounds to me like they're allowed to continue excavating the human remains.

1094
01:18:52.500 --> 01:19:08.000
You know, yes, they have to notify the state archaeologists in five working days, but I don't see any language that prohibits them from not continuing to excavate the human remains.

1095
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Thank you, Mr.

1096
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Chair.

1097
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And thank you, but it seems to me that you're discussing the amendment, not the bill.

1098
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.000
So that's what I have in front of me right now, yes.

1099
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Okay.

1100
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Mr.

1101
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Chairman.

1102
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So, thank you, Mr.

1103
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Chairman.

1104
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Are you looking at the amendment?

1105
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Amendment to SB 11?

1106
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
1597H.

1107
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Okay.

1108
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:57.500
So just for clarification, we actually haven't gotten to that yet, but just for your information, that's language out of the Native American Grave Act.

1109
01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.500
That's right out of existing statute.

1110
01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.500
Just FYI.

1111
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.500
That's not original language.

1112
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.500
That's in current statute.

1113
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.000
That's where that comes from.

1114
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:20.500
just in case anybody else was wondering too FYI but we haven't got to it yet yeah that's what else was wondering too.

1115
01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.500
FYI.

1116
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:26.000
But we haven't got to it yet.

1117
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Yeah, it comes out of we haven't got to it yet, but it does it comes out of 227 C8.

1118
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
But again, we haven't gotten to it yet.

1119
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.000
I'm happy to walk through it, but I don't think we're going to get to that just yet.

1120
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Yeah.

1121
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
That was not our intent, I don't think.

1122
01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
But just so you know, that's where it comes from.

1123
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It's not original language.

1124
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Thank you.

1125
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Okay.

1126
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Any additional questions?

1127
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.500
I'll just let you get back to my questions.

1128
01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:24.500
let's see the said that there's a consultation with with the Senate You said that there's a consultation with the descendant community, et cetera.

1129
01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:26.500
What?

1130
01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:30.000
There's a consultation with the descendant community.

1131
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:36.500
What power does the descendant community actually have when you're discussing the issue?

1132
01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:48.000
You have somebody who you have the remains and you've identified the remains or at least see what community the remains come from.

1133
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
What power does the descendants or the descendant community have?

1134
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
What demands can they put on the state?

1135
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Thank you.

1136
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Just so people are aware, if you're not speaking into the microphone, then people on YouTube cannot hear a word.

1137
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:20.000
We're hoping to have the whole hearing on record so that we can refer back to it and play it for people.

1138
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Yeah.

1139
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:40.500
To get back to my question, what legal rights do they have and what demands can they make of the state in the disposition of the – So it's not necessarily going to be between the state.

1140
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:45.000
It's going to be the federal government with NAGPRA.

1141
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
If you're dealing with Native American remains, it's federal law.

1142
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Okay.

1143
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.500
And they can make any demand that they want.

1144
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.500
It's consultation though, right?

1145
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.500
So it's a back and forth.

1146
01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.500
An agreement has to be coming.

1147
01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:14.000
So they can make whatever demand they want and the other side can try and work out whatever arrangement.

1148
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
They're highly variable.

1149
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Okay.

1150
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Relative to the state, what kind of demands?

1151
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.500
I'm confused by your question.

1152
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:43.000
In other words, you have to – can the descendants or the descendant community, can they say, well, I want the remains reburied, and I want them reburied with a bronze casket, and I want a parade.

1153
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
What do they have?

1154
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.500
What are their legal rights?

1155
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:51.500
Again, are you asking about Native American remains?

1156
01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.500
No.

1157
01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:55.500
Just in general?

1158
01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.500
Yes, just in general.

1159
01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:05.000
So if it's a non-Native American, then, you know, again, it depends on the situation.

1160
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:19.000
So, you know, the cemeteries that are private cemeteries, the complete control and power of those does belong to the descended community or the next of kin, essentially.

1161
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.500
On a town-owned cemetery, that's going to be, the town has ultimate jurisdiction over that.

1162
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:44.000
So if you have remains that are coming from a town-owned cemetery, which a majority of them are in towns, that's the town has, so to speak, has the rights to do what they will.

1163
01:24:44.000 --> 01:25:28.500
I mean, you're not going to have a lot of human remains being unexpectedly discovered in a town-owned cemetery i believe you're just trying to ask more about the the cemeteries that aren't really marked on farm says and those are because those are still privately owned even if a new landowner is taken over the rights to that cemetery or that burial ground still lying with the next of kin so even to excavate that you have to actually find the next of kin and get their permission.

1164
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:36.000
So I would imagine the same process would be for their human remains as well.

1165
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:44.500
But just as a follow-up to that, if you did not know that those remains were there...

1166
01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.500
It's still a private burial ground.

1167
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.000
And even if they were...

1168
01:25:50.000 --> 01:26:05.000
So if there's no record of there having been a burial ground there but found a grave, that still makes the landowner – that is no longer the landowner's property?

1169
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.500
That's beyond my wheel well.

1170
01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:14.500
I deal with human remains and how to track down the next of kin.

1171
01:26:14.500 --> 01:27:11.500
But, yeah, as far as I know, if you have a private cemetery, and a lot of them are not marked, so a lot of people don't know they're on their their property and in fact it was common procedure for a lot of farmers and whatnot when they sold their property when a new new person would come in they didn't remove the burials they would just remove the headstones and call the graves removed as far as i know i think a burial ground is a burial ground whether or not the markers are still there or not ignorance i don't know if that gets gets you out of it or not.

1172
01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.500
You had a question?

1173
01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.500
No.

1174
01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.500
Oh.

1175
01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:19.500
Thank you, Mr.

1176
01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.500
Chair.

1177
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:24.500
Thank you for taking my question.

1178
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:34.000
I was just intrigued by what you said about you try to track down the names of the people.

1179
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:42.500
Does the DNA testing actually bring you to names of people so you can chase their descendants?

1180
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.500
How do you figure that out?

1181
01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:49.000
So DNA has to be authorized, right?

1182
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:56.500
So a lot of times with Native American communities, they don't want DNA testing done.

1183
01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:06.000
But when we're talking about names, we're talking about where we have a burial on a plot of land.

1184
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:20.000
You go back, you look at who owned the land through time, and then you can try and deduce who the family was during the time of burial.

1185
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
That's how we begin our research.

1186
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Follow-up?

1187
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Follow-up, follow-up.

1188
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.500
So you can tell by the remains when approximately the body was buried?

1189
01:28:33.500 --> 01:29:44.500
Not necessarily the remains themselves, but the grave goods, the coffin hardware, things like that can at least narrow it down usually to the century um and a lot of times there are family records if you go to the town um town historical societies things like that um even if you look at the um the plat maps most of them had houses where they were located they had the family name written down on them too so that's kind of how we get started and it's not an easy process and we don't always get the exact next of kin thank you mr chairman and thank you um so under present uh statute if there are human remains found and the medical examiner comes in but the the um decision's been made that this this is an African-American burial ground.

1190
01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:46.500
What's the process currently?

1191
01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:50.500
I've never had a deal with that yet.

1192
01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:59.000
There's been one case that I know of in the state, and that was before my time.

1193
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:12.500
So I would assume that it would be treated the same as all other human remains cases, that we would try and find the next of kin.

1194
01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:18.500
If not, we would at least try and identify the descendant community.

1195
01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:23.500
And I'm assuming you're asking how we can tell ethnicity.

1196
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.500
Go right ahead.

1197
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:43.500
So the ethnicity, a lot of times if there's enough remains, especially cranial features, a forensic anthropologist can, with pretty good accuracy, identify the at least region of the world that the person originally came from.

1198
01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.500
Not that person, but the lineage came from.

1199
01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:57.000
So they have a pretty good record of identifying whether it's Native American remains, African American remains, Caucasian remains.

1200
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.000
So again, that would help us identify the descendant community.

1201
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:53.000
If we did have, that's really kind of the only way we would know unless we had some specific artifact burial good that was with the remains that they were african-american would be through that forensic anthropology analysis okay follow up mr chair so if it was determined that it's an african-american remains um then under current statute um your office would uh if there was no next of kin that could be found, let's say they're former slaves, then a descendant community would be identified that could then be of counsel on the disposition of those remains that's currently in statute?

1202
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Right.

1203
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So what happened, again, I wasn't part of this, but what happened with the African-American burial ground over in Portsmouth, that, again, was the descended community, which was the African-American community from that area, and or people that had ties, African-Americans that had ties to that area in the past, they became the descended community, and they were the ones that were consulted with.

1204
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.500
And they're actually still to this day consulted with.

1205
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:36.000
There's still ongoing studies and things with those remains.

1206
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:44.500
So that community is still consulted every time someone proposes a new study or there's a question.

1207
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:55.000
I think that's one thing I was involved in was even to have the remains removed from one facility to another.

1208
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.500
I think they ended up going to the Smithsonian.

1209
01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:04.500
The community, the Descended community was consulted even on that.

1210
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:12.000
So they're consulted every step of the way for everything that happens to the remains.

1211
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Okay.

1212
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Just a clarification.

1213
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
But that is currently in statute.

1214
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.500
That's currently what we do.

1215
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.500
But it's just practice, not statute.

1216
01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:27.000
It may be in statute.

1217
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:40.500
Like I said, I'm not familiar enough with that statute to say that that's exactly what's supposed to happen with African-American remains if it's actually spelled out.

1218
01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:51.000
But that's the procedure that we take with all remains is to identify the next of kin or the descendant community.

1219
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Okay, thank you.

1220
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Thank you, Mr.

1221
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Chair.

1222
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.500
Thank you for the question.

1223
01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:05.500
So just because I think statute is what, we're concerned about here.

1224
01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:27.000
Just reading to you from 227 C8E, which is this consultation with other individuals, it only talks about if the professional archaeologist determines human skeletal remains or other than Native American, the requirement to publish a notice of excavation for four consecutive weeks.

1225
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:44.500
So I applaud you, but it appears that you're going above and beyond the current statute with the idea being that the townspeople, there's some heritage maybe within local towns that would see that notification.

1226
01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:58.000
But I think one of the concerns that I've heard expressed with respect to the African-American community, the former enslaved people, is that they don't have representatives.

1227
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:06.000
They might not have representatives any longer in those towns because they didn't have descendants there.

1228
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And so it sounds like you might not have experienced this case yourself, but I was wondering if you can – first, if you disagree with my reading of the statute, I'd be happy to understand why I'm misinterpreting it.

1229
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:51.500
But I'm also interested if you think that it might be appropriate to add to statute a specific clause about contacting the descendant community in these African American burial cases because of the potential disconnect from when they were essentially property and might not have had family traceability throughout the towns.

1230
01:35:51.500 --> 01:36:04.000
I mean, I guess from my perspective, we treat all human remains the same as far as we try to identify the next of kin.

1231
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.500
I mean, I kind of understand where you're going with that.

1232
01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:18.000
If you want to add that, I guess I really have no opinion either way on that.

1233
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Thank you.

1234
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Thanks for coming out.

1235
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:46.000
So further in the bill, there's a section down by, I'll say on page two, that it talks about the, basically, a New Hampshire educational or research institutions, museum, historical societies, and other collections shall make reasonable efforts to inventory any remains of other materials from African-American graves.

1236
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:54.500
My question to you is, is that done – how is that done across any other cultures?

1237
01:36:54.500 --> 01:37:37.000
We do that for all remains and grave goods, particularly and more so for Native American remains just because of the federal law.'s been around since 1990 but yeah for all remains the ultimate goal is to return them and all the grave goods to a an appropriate burial location again if we can get the input of the next of kin or descended community that's great and that's what we try and do there are definitely cases with, I'll just give you an example.

1238
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.500
We had a Caucasian burial.

1239
01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:49.000
The closest next of kin lived down in Florida, so again, we don't just advertise in the local paper.

1240
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.500
We go and we track these people down as much as we can.

1241
01:37:55.500 --> 01:39:13.500
They didn't even remember or know that ancestor, and they wanted nothing to do with it, so in those situations, we go back to the town we can usually make an arrangement with the town to have a plot donated for free by the town and we rebury the remains there we would follow the same procedure for any individual remains that where we did not have a descendant community next of kin or anyone else that was represented and we still treat them with respect and we still try to repatriate them rebury them with dignity and ceremoniously follow up for a follow-up um it talks about uh in materials have you ever had to deal with taking um i don't know other things that may have been buried with an individual what happens with the materials do they ever get separated from the remains and then go into a museum and the remains go?

1242
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.500
Has that ever happened?

1243
01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:17.500
I'm sure.

1244
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.500
Not anymore.

1245
01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:29.000
People, it's definitely frowned upon to put anything in a museum anymore that has to do with grave goods.

1246
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:36.000
And with Native American grave goods, it's been highly against the law since 1990.

1247
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.500
And you're obligated to inventory.

1248
01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:50.500
But, yeah, to answer your question more directly, anything that comes out, and, you know, with Native Americans, you can get some grave goods.

1249
01:39:50.500 --> 01:40:12.000
For the most part, when you're talking about Caucasians, burials, you're not really getting grave goods other than what they might have been wearing, like a button or something like that, or the coffin hardware, the wood from the coffin is usually gone.

1250
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:19.000
But all those materials, whatever was recovered, is always buried back with the remains.

1251
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.000
I mean, that's our current policy.

1252
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:31.000
I can't speak to what happened five years ago, ten years ago, or the history of it overall.

1253
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:46.500
I know definitely in the past there are definitely things in museums that are grave goods, and you'll hear cases constantly where people are repatriating those as well and reburying those.

1254
01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:48.500
Thank you.

1255
01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:50.500
Thank you.

1256
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.500
Thank you.

1257
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:59.000
Thank you very much for coming, and thank you for taking my question.

1258
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:06.500
Can you make any comment at all about the sort of testimony that we heard?

1259
01:41:06.500 --> 01:42:04.000
There's a shed with African Americanrican-american bones in it and i think it was unh uh what the uh bill sponsor was discussing that those remains should be repatriated and and this is part of the reason for the bills there needs to be a process for that can you comment thanks i can honestly say i have no idea about a shed on you said you ain't you and h yeah i've never heard that before in my life so it's news to me okay i wasn't making that up was i so so recently um it was in the media that dartmouth college was using bones in their – was it the sociology?

1260
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
No, sorry.

1261
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Anthropology.

1262
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Anthropology program.

1263
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.500
They were using them for study materials up until last November.

1264
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:20.000
And so – But those were Native American remains.

1265
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.500
Those were Native American remains.

1266
01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:26.500
And so these sorts of things still happen.

1267
01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:46.000
So I think one of the things, sort of the elephant in the room is that African Americans and Africans did not have the same, were not given the same burial rights in a sense that other groups were.

1268
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.500
For instance, Irish and Scottish and runs the gamut.

1269
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:54.000
They were property for the most part.

1270
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
And so they show up in probate records.

1271
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:11.500
They don't necessarily, they show up as, you know, a young man, you know, was part of, you know, this family's property, so on and so forth.

1272
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:18.500
And they didn't have the same burials that other populations did within the country.

1273
01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:24.500
And so much like Native Americans, their burial practices were much different.

1274
01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:29.000
You do find various things in African-American African burials.

1275
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:35.500
They had different rituals depended on where they were from, from the continent.

1276
01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:49.500
And so the idea I think here is that we're trying to recognize those burials much the way we do with the native indigenous population, plain and simple.

1277
01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:57.000
And there aren't the same, as Mark alluded to, the same relatives or probate information.

1278
01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:09.500
We can't go back and look at, you know, deed records for properties and see that, you know, the age is necessarily of the graves.

1279
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:33.500
So it's basically trying to treat these these findings these materials these remains much the way we do afford them the same process that the native indigenous population has so so so we don't we it's very very difficult to find relatives next of kin for these remains.

1280
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:48.500
So we go to the next group, which would be, I think, in the original bill, we were being asked to go to the Heritage Trail folks down in Portsmouth.

1281
01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:58.000
and then I think DHR was then going to be substituted as the group that should be conferred with.

1282
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:06.000
But we would obviously be also looking to that native population if we could find it.

1283
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.500
So I just want to sort of clear up.

1284
01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:20.500
I think we're sort of beating around the bush here on what is trying to be done through this legislation.

1285
01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:28.000
And we don't have a horse in this race by any stretch of the imagination.

1286
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
As Mark said, we treat all remains the same way.

1287
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:44.500
The indigenous population is really the only group by federal law that is treated in a different manner, and we stick to that.

1288
01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.500
Thank you, Mr.

1289
01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.500
Chair.

1290
01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.500
Thank you.

1291
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:55.000
And I also have copies of the original bill.

1292
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.500
If anybody needs a copy of the original bill.

1293
01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:04.000
And you all may need another copy as well.

1294
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:15.000
So I think my question is, I'm trying to tease apart sort of what would happen in the eventuality of your retirement.

1295
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:27.000
It sounds like a lot of this is sort of best practices or morally what you all feel is the best thing to do.

1296
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:42.500
And it seems to me like this bill is trying to get into statute some of the things that maybe aren't in law but are best practice around African American burials.

1297
01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.500
Is that, am I?

1298
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.500
I think you're correct.

1299
01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.500
Okay, great.

1300
01:46:48.500 --> 01:47:11.500
So, when you're looking at the original bill and you're thinking about best practices that you do now around this and what is morally necessary, are there any things you see in the bill that you feel you would change based on your own professional practice?

1301
01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:13.500
No.

1302
01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:15.500
Thank you.

1303
01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:17.500
Thank you, Mr.

1304
01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500
Chair.

1305
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:38.000
This is not totally a question, but I just wanted to point out, again, statute 227 C8 I, which says that, like you pointed out, human remains discovered, acquired after January 1st, 1987 cannot be be retained.

1306
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:43.500
But before 1987, legally, currently, except for they can be retained.

1307
01:47:43.500 --> 01:48:04.500
And so I think that's why the sections that you're pointing out are called there, because I think there's concerns that some of these were found before 1987, and then the museums may be able to retain these legally at this point.

1308
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:15.000
So because it's a work section, I didn't think I actually had to form that in the phrase of a question.

1309
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.500
I want to just state what the statute says.

1310
01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:21.500
Thank you, Mr.

1311
01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:23.500
Chairman.

1312
01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:32.500
Thanks for taking the time to go through the bill as amended by the Senate that we got.

1313
01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:42.500
But can you also take a look at the redraft, which is essentially the bill as amended by the Senate?

1314
01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.500
It's virtually identical.

1315
01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:52.500
it just puts it in the proper chapter since it was mischaptered, and it's almost identical.

1316
01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:59.000
And much of the amendment that you saw is identical to current law.

1317
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.000
In fact, the bolded parts are what's new.

1318
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:22.000
So the Native American statutes is current law, and only the bolded pieces on the printed copy that you see of the amendment are new, and that's what's taken the part that refers to suspected African-American burial ground.

1319
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.000
That's out of the version as amended by the Senate.

1320
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And then on the last page, and all the other bolded parts come right out of the, as amended by the Senate.

1321
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:48.500
All the part that, like on page 2, line 16, state archaeologists shall immediately notify the descendants of the Senate community.

1322
01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:59.000
And all that language, that's out of the, as amended by the Senate, but it's just put into the proper chapter.

1323
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:05.000
So OLS advised that it was mischaptered and it should be here.

1324
01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:12.500
And that's the purpose of the amendment, just to get it into the right chapter.

1325
01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:16.500
So it really doesn't change any of it.

1326
01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:21.500
That's why there's no new amended analysis, no new title.

1327
01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.500
It's identical.

1328
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:37.500
In fact, on page four, section five of the amendment, all of that from line 18 down is verbatim out of the as amended by the Senate version.

1329
01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:42.500
It's just more appropriate in 289.11 than it was there.

1330
01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.500
And that's from OLS.

1331
01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:51.500
They said it has to go there because it's relative to cemeteries, not bodies.

1332
01:50:51.500 --> 01:51:12.000
So if you can take a minute, since we've been talking a lot about the as amended by the Senate version, if we want to do this, we should do it right and get it in the right chapters of law.

1333
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:24.000
And so if you can take a minute and talk about the amendment and tell us, does this put any undue burden on you?

1334
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Since I realize a lot of it's already done and it's great that you treat all remains the same, we would expect nothing less.

1335
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:53.500
but what I really would like to hear is do you, pardon the speech but do you does this put any, the amendment put any undue burden on the division or any undue financial burden?

1336
01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:56.500
Can you comment on the amendment?

1337
01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:59.000
Well, that's two separate questions.

1338
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Or comparing – Financial burden, we could talk about that over at the bar for an hour and a half after that.

1339
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
But I will...

1340
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
It's about six questions.

1341
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.500
I mean, just give us your opinion.

1342
01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:20.500
Your first question doesn't add anything.

1343
01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:23.000
We do all this already.

1344
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
So no additional burden.

1345
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
This is...

1346
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
We do this plus more already.

1347
01:52:30.000 --> 01:53:21.500
And like I was commenting before, you will never see human remains discovered in New Hampshire where they just call us and we say, yeah yeah just keep digging that just doesn't happen it might say that's okay in here but we just we don't do that you we shut things down you can't just continue to dig on human remains without having a better plan going forward so no there's nothing in here that's that's gonna burden us as far as what we're doing already we already do everything that's in here plus a little more so this is the appropriate place.

1348
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.500
Thank you.

1349
01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:33.500
I think I had one quick follow-up, and that's on the parts where it talks a lot about professional archaeologists.

1350
01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:41.000
I know that seemed like a bit of a surprise, but it wasn't my language.

1351
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:54.500
Only the parts on the first page of the amendment that appear in bold print, and that's in lines 14, 15, 18, 19, and 30 and 31.

1352
01:53:54.500 --> 01:54:04.500
Only the bold print stuff, and those words come right out of the Senate bill as amended by the Senate.

1353
01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:09.500
All that other stuff is in current statute in 227C8A.

1354
01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:11.500
That's existing.

1355
01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:14.500
All that stuff about professional archaeologists.

1356
01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:19.500
If you think we ought to change that, speak now.

1357
01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:24.500
We could change that stuff, but that's in current law.

1358
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:28.000
You could change it if you want.

1359
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:44.500
I'm just saying in practice, it would be a PR nightmare if people were allowed to continue excavating human remains on a construction site, in their backyard, on a pool, or anything else.

1360
01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:54.000
So I'm just telling you in practice, people don't just keep taking up human remains without a proper procedure.

1361
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.500
We'll leave it to you, but it's current law.

1362
01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:02.500
I mean, that's how it is written now.

1363
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:06.000
I didn't put that in the amendment.

1364
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
That's right there.

1365
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Okay.

1366
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Excuse me.

1367
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Which line are you talking about?

1368
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.000
I just got a little lost.

1369
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:24.500
In the amendment, Part B, pretty much Part B, subparts 1 through 4.

1370
01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:32.500
And there's some other parts, too, that talk about continuing to excavate, just making a notification.

1371
01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:34.500
It's current statute.

1372
01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:51.000
And when OLS drafted this amendment, they just advised that when the Senate drafted it, they presented some texts and just said, for lack of a better word, can you write this up?

1373
01:55:51.000 --> 01:56:12.500
And then in some discussions, they advised that really it's better placed where the other special treatment for human remains in current statute is, and the only other place that New Hampshire has special treatment for any human remains is in Native American.

1374
01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:21.500
We have, you know, some language for special treatment of certain human remains, and that's in Native American.

1375
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:27.500
And so that's the place for this bill in our current RSAs.

1376
01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:38.500
So they just basically took Senator Waters and all the other sponsors, who's the prime sponsor, and put it in that chapter.

1377
01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:56.000
And it ended up in two places, 227C, and then the other stuff that doesn't refer to bodies, cemetery stuff, gates and monuments and whatnot, in 289, which was the Section 5, and that's verbatim.

1378
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.500
If you compare them, it's literally verbatim.

1379
01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:01.500
Representative Darby.

1380
01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.500
Thank you, Mr.

1381
01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.500
Chair.

1382
01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:12.500
So I agree with you that the Humans Remains section should be in 227.

1383
01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:17.500
I'm not sure I completely agree with this text yet.

1384
01:57:17.500 --> 01:57:20.000
I'd have to review it.

1385
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.500
It seems a little extensive.

1386
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:29.500
I also agree that 289.14a, so the original bill tried to do four things.

1387
01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:34.500
It tried to talk about human remains, unmarked human remains.

1388
01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:50.500
It tried to talk about private burial grounds that are being maintained under section, which is under cemeteries, which is why part of this has to be under cemeteries, which is 289.

1389
01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:53.500
But private burial grounds are 289.14a.

1390
01:57:53.500 --> 01:58:00.000
And then it also talked about when you are reinterring bodies as well.

1391
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000
It's trying to talk about that.

1392
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:13.000
That's when, you know, if you were to move, which is legal, move a graveyard from one place to another.

1393
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Those are three separate situations where you may encounter African-American remains from this period that have specific customs with respect to burials.

1394
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:45.500
The fourth thing that the original bill tried to do was exactly like Representative Johnnelly pointed out, is to return, in particular, human remains that might be in archaeology caches, for lack of a better word, and make sure that those are reinterred.

1395
01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:50.500
And I don't see that section in this at all.

1396
01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.500
Mr.

1397
01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:57.500
Chairman, do you mind if I just respond to that?

1398
01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:03.500
Because it is, we literally preserved each and every piece of that.

1399
01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:13.500
It's the bottom of page one, line 30 continues over to the top of page two, lines one and two.

1400
01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:21.000
So all of that stuff was preserved faithfully to preserve the spirit of that bill.

1401
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:38.500
So it reads, the ultimate disposition of the remains and other archeological materials, such as markers, gates, mortar materials, in an African-American burial ground shall be in consultation with the descendants of the dissentic community.

1402
01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:41.000
That's what you're talking about.

1403
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:46.000
I definitely don't want, I'm not trying to debate here.

1404
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:54.000
I just want to make sure you saw the original bill said by June 30th, 2028.

1405
01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:02.500
Well, the intent of this was so that it was just, it would just get done, period.

1406
02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:07.500
I don't think we want to go back and forth.

1407
02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.500
That's fine.

1408
02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:13.500
I was just trying to point that out.

1409
02:00:13.500 --> 02:00:25.500
You've raised an issue, and usually that's when you can disagree to disagree for now, but we'll work it out later, continue it later.

1410
02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:28.500
Any other questions for Representative Hart?

1411
02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:30.500
Thank you.

1412
02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:34.000
I'd like to address this to Mr.

1413
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.500
Wilson just to confirm what I think you said.

1414
02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:48.500
Did you say – I thought I heard you say that 227C is a better place to put these changes.

1415
02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:52.000
By adding African-American to the Native American.

1416
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.000
To the North American, the indigenous.

1417
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Okay, thank you.

1418
02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
That's what I thought you said.

1419
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
I just wanted to be short.

1420
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Thank you.

1421
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Representative Darby.

1422
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.500
I'm sorry that I'm confused.

1423
02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:36.000
I thought you were also agreeing that a section of cemeteries for the private cemeteries and for reinterment should also be included, that there were multiple conditions that had to be accounted for with the intent of this bill, which is to include the descendant community in treating the remains of African Americans.

1424
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:39.500
So both 227 as well as 289.

1425
02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:41.500
Okay, thank you.

1426
02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:43.500
Thank you.

1427
02:01:43.500 --> 02:02:10.000
Not to belabor this too much, but back to what Representative McHugh was saying and Representative Darby we're talking about the returning in a reinterring of caches etc now you would said before so if we went with with representative McHugh's language I believe you were talking about how there is a process.

1428
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:23.500
You contact the descendant community, and then you sort of work out the details of when things are happening, or you sort of bargain in a sense.

1429
02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:27.500
So is that something that would happen anyway?

1430
02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:31.000
If you could expound on that, thanks.

1431
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Right.

1432
02:02:33.000 --> 02:03:18.000
So this law obviously wasn't in existence when the ports of burial occurred um and that's as i said it's how it's been going on the consultation back and forth and i said it's it's not something that is just done and it's over until those remains are ultimately put into a final resting place which they are not yet for various reasons um the descendant community is still consulted on every move even if that move is putting them into a different room in the same museum, they're consulted.

1433
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Thank you, Mr.

1434
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Chair.

1435
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.500
So I want to follow up on Representative Harvey Bolio's question.

1436
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:43.000
So let's say the anthropology department at UNH, they're moving into a new building or a new floor, and they're cleaning out their basement, and they see a box of bones.

1437
02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
What happens?

1438
02:03:45.000 --> 02:04:26.500
Is that treated exactly the same way as if somebody was digging up a backyard and found bones, like as a medicaliner called well ideally they would have some paperwork that would suggest they're not part of a murder okay one would hope although i won't get into specifics but there has there was a recent situation where some remains were found in a facility um and there was no documentation whatsoever so we kind of had to start over on that one.

1439
02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:46.500
But barring strange occurrences like that, when human remains are found in museum collections or at universities, they're generally not going through the ME's office to verify that they're not part of a murder or any kind of follow-up play.

1440
02:04:46.500 --> 02:06:02.000
They do just jump into the procedure of trying to trying to identify again most of the time when you have remains in a museum setting they are not caucasian i would say the overwhelming amount has been native american over the years and those of course when they're discovered they have to immediately notify the national park service because it's federal jurisdiction then they go through the whole nagpur process if it was african-american and they've the first step would be identifying you know what ethnicity if the paperwork doesn't already tell you um luckily at unh in your example they have forensic anthropologists right there that would do the analysis and would ultimately say like well this is these aren't african-american native american or whatnot and then the the correct or the um the the descendant community or next of kin would be identified and we'd go from there.

1441
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:09.000
And there's actually an ongoing case right now at UNH that's following the procedures.

1442
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:14.500
But they're following procedures, but those procedures aren't established in statute.

1443
02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:16.500
It's just best practices.

1444
02:06:16.500 --> 02:07:19.000
Well, I mean, as far as just human remains in general, there are the procedures that they're in statute maybe not as specific as as are in here and honestly i mean in here is it talking about the every single there's still decisions outside of what's even written in here that have to be made by the people that are doing it um so i guess i can't answer that question completely it's what we do it's what has what we read i guess with any law there's interpretation that's how we interpret the law to be okay we identify the remains we have to figure out who the next candidate is a and go from there thank you that's our interpretation Thank you.

1445
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Yeah, microphone is better.

1446
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
I'm looking for Mike.

1447
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.500
I didn't find him either.

1448
02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:27.500
Okay.

1449
02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:38.000
Is there a date on which the issue with remains, burial, date which things don't apply, especially the Native American one.

1450
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:49.500
If there are Native Americans, uh, full-blooded Native Americans who live, you know, I, I know some, and most, most of us do.

1451
02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:59.500
Uh, if when, when they pass that you don't use the, uh, Native American law, historical law relative to them?

1452
02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:04.500
Is that, you know, are they not covered under that?

1453
02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.500
Are they still?

1454
02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:10.500
Again, you asked kind of two questions there.

1455
02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:15.000
One was how, you know, what date or whatever.

1456
02:08:15.000 --> 02:09:21.000
so if Native American remains are held at a museum or anything else they need to be reported and and turned over repatriated uh to the second part of your question uh if they're part of our society today yes they're just like everyone else they have a birth certificate they for most people have a birth certificate social security card and all the rest of it so i guess the identifying of them and i i don't know i mean they would have kind of equal footing on that i don't honestly know i haven't had a case where nagpro applies to someone that someone's remains from that just passed away last week i don't know that you'd have to contact the national park service on that that's their jurisdiction oh.

1457
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Thank you.

1458
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.500
My gut, my instinct is that no.

1459
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:29.000
Yeah, it just doesn't seem.

1460
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I think it's more for things that have.

1461
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:40.500
So put it this way, you can't collect human remains anymore, so it's not really.

1462
02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:47.500
If you have them, you're going to be in trouble outside of historical resources.

1463
02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:52.000
I was talking about graves, graveyards, things like that.

1464
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.000
If some, talking about someone who was buried in 1900 or 1920.

1465
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Sure, so that's still going to be NAEPRA.

1466
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:21.000
If you're talking about someone that got buried in 1975 and they happen to be of Native American lineage, I think if you have those remains, I think you're probably going to get in trouble under other laws.

1467
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:28.000
I don't think we're going to have to go through NAGPRA on that one.

1468
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:31.500
Again, not having the remains, just moving.

1469
02:10:31.500 --> 02:11:10.000
I think someone that's buried in 1975, most likely you're going to be covered by just the traditional cemetery laws because most likely those remains buried in 1975 are buried in a cemetery that's marked and has all the regular protections, as opposed to this law is really talking more about unmarked burials, you know, higher likelihood of unmarked burials be native american african american poor white people marginalized communities any other any other questions Let's see.

1470
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:15.000
I can go on, but I know I'll let you...

1471
02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Does anyone else have any statement?

1472
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Anyone want to get involved and they have a question?

1473
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
I know there's people...

1474
02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I see you've raised your hand several times.

1475
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.500
I'll just make one-minute comment.

1476
02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:33.500
I'm Jennifer Goodman.

1477
02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:35.500
Oh, yeah.

1478
02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:40.500
Well, thank you for your time and attention on this.

1479
02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:50.000
I'm Jennifer Goodman with the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance, the nonprofit sister, basically, of the Division of Historical Resources.

1480
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:54.000
So I appreciate the time and the conversation.

1481
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:59.000
I guess I wanted to put a plug in again.

1482
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:21.500
Appreciate the amendment lining things up right in statute, but I wanted to put in a plug for the encouragement for the institutions, the historical societies and museums to reflect on their their collections and consider what they have and what steps they might take.

1483
02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:44.500
And my understanding is from some of your hard work on this last year, going to this year, there was the change from saying shall, is that correct, that those local institutions, those institutions shall inventory and take these steps to an encouragement to do so.

1484
02:12:44.500 --> 02:13:01.000
So I just wanted to put in a plug again for that, for this year, to hold that up as a way to suggest more good practice for those institutions across the state.

1485
02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Anyone else?

1486
02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I do have one additional question.

1487
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:17.000
I think the way I've heard it phrased here is that everyone's treated the same, but that's not what the law says.

1488
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I mean, you're trying to treat everyone, all that you dig up, or anything that comes before you, you try to treat in the same manner.

1489
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.500
But statutorily, only lists the Native Americans.

1490
02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:42.500
Is there a way that we can make the bill such that it treats everybody the same statutorily?

1491
02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:44.500
Well, sure.

1492
02:13:44.500 --> 02:13:48.000
You can write it however you want.

1493
02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Okay.

1494
02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Then all right.

1495
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
So all right.

1496
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
That's very good.

1497
02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Thank you.

1498
02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Any other questions by anyone here?

1499
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
If not.

1500
02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:09.500
And I'd be remiss if I didn't apologize for missing the original hearing.

1501
02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:13.000
I had another conflict, and I apologize.

1502
02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.000
And we're happy to be available for questions going forward.

1503
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Okay.

1504
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Thank you.

1505
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Thank you for coming.

1506
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Appreciate it.

1507
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Very good.

1508
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Thank you for coming.

1509
02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Thank you very much.

1510
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.500
I don't know about you.

1511
02:14:34.500 --> 02:14:41.500
Yes, I don't know about you guys, but I'm kind of tearing it out.

1512
02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:45.000
You want to close the work session?

1513
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.000
So I'm going to close the work session.

1514
02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Thank you.

1515
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Thank you.

1516
02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Thank you.
