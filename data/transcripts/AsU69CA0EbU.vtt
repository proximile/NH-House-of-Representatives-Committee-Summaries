this meeting of the house election law
 
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.130 align:start position:0%
this meeting of the house election law
committee

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
um we'll start off with the pledge uh
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative wood you want to do the
 
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:35.390 align:start position:0%
representative wood you want to do the
honors

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.089 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
all right so uh to answer the question
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
for if you saw scurring around a minute
 
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
ago we were trying to find out if you
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
had to have a quorum to have a public
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
hearing because we have 50 not 51 uh and
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
the clerk has said we do not need 51 to
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
hold a public hearing so that's why we
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
are a little delayed uh I'm going to
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me House Bill 336 relative to the
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
format of election bouts uh welcome
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill to election law
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and members
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
I had to begin with telling you this
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
this bill needs a little work it will
 
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
need an amendment and uh
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
I hope we can work through this uh but
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
the the idea here is for for many of us
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know we we have a 400 member house
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
and not many of those uh seats are in
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
and then uh boards but in
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
like for example in my district of New
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
Market and new Fields neither town has
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
Wards so we are three representatives in
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
a forterio and all of us have the whole
 
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
territory there are no Awards so that on
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
the ballot as I was giving you a copy of
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
last year's general election uh results
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there are three
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
three Republicans three Democrats and
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
1725 undervotes
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm here today but I this
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
is the first year that the uh Secretary
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
of State's office has recorded the
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
number of blanks when I've been hearing
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
my moderator you know read off the
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
number of blanks and you know 1200 you
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
know et cetera you know it just seems a
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
little high
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
so while we can't compel someone to vote
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
for someone in every you know each of
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
those people I think it might be useful
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
to let them know that uh whether or not
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
they do participate and vote that far
 
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
down the ballot uh that number of people
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
will be elected and we'll be up here in
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
Concord you know sponsoring and voting
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
on bills so it I think it couldn't hurt
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
and it might help
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
so that's what this is that's what this
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill is about
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
and what this really think of everything
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
below line six on the bill as not being
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
as really an if then statement or a case
 
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.020 align:start position:0%
statement if you like
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't be putting if you look at
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
line five we wouldn't be
 
00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
where it says below each so such phrase
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
it would really be the appropriate
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
phrase if there's if there's one only
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
one to be elected for the for the
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
position then we would say uh vote for
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
not more than one
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
next to that one
 
00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
and in the case where there are multiple
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
candidates in multiple positions uh you
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
would say vote for up to in the case of
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
New Market three
 
00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
and that would be all this other bolded
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh italic forget about it uh if you
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
would uh just over here next to line
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
five the appropriate and insert a
 
00:38:48.849 --> 00:38:48.859 align:start position:0%
quotation uh in line seven after the one
 
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
followed immediately by a parentheses
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
and another parentheses at the end of
 
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
where it says on line eight District
 
00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:58.069 align:start position:0%
where it says on line eight District
column

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
column
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
so then there's an or if an or
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
and then we would have more uh
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
more editing on the second on the B
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
statement so again we're not doing all
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
of this printing all this text it's just
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to be where there's one can be
 
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
elected or one choice between one
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
in one position we'll do one thing if
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
there's three four five seven candidates
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
in Derry or whatever we'll do a
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
different thing
 
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
and I I think this may help so that
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
people will say well I shouldn't write
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
Mickey Mouse I should uh choose from the
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
above people or a serious write-in if I
 
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
know there is a campaign for someone
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
that I would like better but I should
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
probably pick my best shot on either
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
side of the ballot that number and not
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
more which we know leads to overvotes
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
questions from Vinnie yes representative
 
00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.810 align:start position:0%
questions from Vinnie yes representative
Kinney

00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
Kinney
 
00:40:01.609 --> 00:40:01.619 align:start position:0%
uh yeah when I was reading this I mean
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
it seemed a little complicated and then
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
I couldn't understand why this was
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
better than vote for not more than one
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
or vote for not more than four
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
I mean what is it what does it do that
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
that statement doesn't do
 
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.010 align:start position:0%
that statement doesn't do
um

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
vote for not more than and vote for up
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
to mean the same thing but votes for
 
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
updo seems a bit more welcoming uh and
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging than vote for not more of
 
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.130 align:start position:0%
encouraging than vote for not more of
that

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative prudham O'Brien
 
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the
 
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.370 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the
ballot

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
that you provided right that's from you
 
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.450 align:start position:0%
that you provided right that's from you
okay

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
and there aren't a lot of overvotes on
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
here and the races where there is only
 
00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.450 align:start position:0%
here and the races where there is only
one

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm only seeing one over vote and
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:00.780 align:start position:0%
I just
 
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:03.020 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at the State State Rep
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you wouldn't
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
an undervote reflect the will of the
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
voter also if a voter only thought two
 
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:17.540 align:start position:0%
people in a race with three open seats
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
were their choice wouldn't that be
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
reflected in the undervotes
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
so that's their choice uh yes yes I
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
would agree with that and there's
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in this additional step that
 
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
tells them they can't make that choice
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
it just clarifies it and you know sort
 
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
of helps them understand that that will
 
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
that that will be the result that three
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
people will be elected in this case
 
00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:47.420 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not they make that choice
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up another question is thank you
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
did people in your community Express
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
that they were finding it confusing the
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
way it is now and is that what this is
 
00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.950 align:start position:0%
way it is now and is that what this is
to

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.109 align:start position:0%
to
fix

00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
fix
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I haven't heard from people in my
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
community that that it is confusing but
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
as I understand from talking with my
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
moderator who talks with other
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
moderators it's prevalent across the
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
state it's not just my community and I
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
think that you might agree that uh
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
because you know in the state
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
legislature doesn't get as much press as
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
the as Congress or the president or uh
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
the Red Sox so that people aren't
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
necessarily tuned into who we are what
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
it is that we do
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and so I I really and if you if
 
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
you've looked at your ballots in your
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
community you might see that people vote
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
at the top and then get kind of tired we
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
have tried telling suggesting people
 
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
they vote from the bottom up but that
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to to register so I thus
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
that actually that the language the
 
00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:56.339 align:start position:0%
language about the uh inserting the
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
number that will be elect that comes
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
from the honorable Susan hamola who
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
noticed my bill uh prior to submitted
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
prior to the election and this is an
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
issue that she was working on and that's
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
that's her part
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
so it's not just Newmarket
 
00:43:12.119 --> 00:43:13.670 align:start position:0%
so it's not just Newmarket
yeah

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.609 align:start position:0%
yeah
representative

00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
taking the question on for state
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative the undervote 1725 when
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
you agree I mean remember back in 2002
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
to 2012 there was in litfield Hudson and
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
Pelham they were vote for no more than
 
00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:36.140 align:start position:0%
13. and and Windham Salem was similar
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
that and I bet then the undervotes would
 
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
have been a whole lot more because don't
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
you think that with the undervote people
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
are bullet voting
 
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a possibility and again
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
we can't prevent nor maybe we shouldn't
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
prevent that but people can and do will
 
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:56.339 align:start position:0%
do as they please this is just a bit
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
more information
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
you know that may that can't hurt and it
 
00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:02.339 align:start position:0%
might help
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.230 align:start position:0%
further questions
representative

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:44:08.819 --> 00:44:10.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
representative

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.990 align:start position:0%
representative
uh

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
am I correct in thinking that the only
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
difference a voter would see on a ballot
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
is the change from the phrase not more
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
than to the phrase up to uh no there's
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
the in the case where there are multiple
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
candidates multiple sorry multiple
 
00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
offices open they would see the number
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
of uh votes were up to that number of
 
00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
that number so that's that's that's the
 
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.370 align:start position:0%
that number so that's that's that's the
difference

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
maybe my follow-up Please Mr chairman
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
yes and represent Boone can you turn
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
your microphone off thank you uh
 
00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm uh remembering incorrectly but
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
my uh memory of the ballots is that it
 
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
says if you've got eight
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
reps in a district that says vote for
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
not more than eight it does and this
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
would say vote for up to eight yes okay
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you oh I'm sorry man it will also
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
say eight will be elected
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
in that case that sort of reinforces the
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
then okay that thank you take your best
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
pick yeah right got it thank you that
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
that makes it clear to me thank you very
 
00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
much thank you further questions
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
um I just have a couple
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
um so the goal here is to make it uh
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
more clear clearer
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
um how many you get to vote for yes
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
um what about field abductive follow
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
what about um so like let's take the
 
00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
standard that's your only multi-canon
 
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.210 align:start position:0%
standard that's your only multi-canon
race

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
race
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
um what if it said three or less
 
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
because I I tend to agree with you like
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
vote for not more than three sounds a
 
00:45:53.569 --> 00:45:53.579 align:start position:0%
little confusing like it seems a little
 
00:45:53.579 --> 00:45:54.710 align:start position:0%
little confusing like it seems a little
Antiquated

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
Antiquated
 
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.490 align:start position:0%
Antiquated
um

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
but I think that might be a an easier
 
00:45:59.410 --> 00:45:59.420 align:start position:0%
change than
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
we do have balance based issues too but
 
00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:05.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the secretary of state will
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
probably bring up right well again it's
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's either vote for up to which is
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
not just a couple of words or vote for
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
less than
 
00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:16.490 align:start position:0%
less than
uh

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I wouldn't I wouldn't object to
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
that but that's not you know you you
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
have the committee I I just sponsored
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
the bill but I do prefer up to because I
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
think that it does sound a bit more
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
inviting you know like uh
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
don't don't take more but have help
 
00:46:35.099 --> 00:46:36.890 align:start position:0%
don't don't take more but have help
yourself

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
take you know this is what's available
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
fair enough we'll probably send this off
 
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
to an English Professor somewhere who
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
will write you know some dissertation
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
about it you can use AI
 
00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh representative Brian thank you I I
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
have many questions so
 
00:46:54.599 --> 00:46:55.250 align:start position:0%
have many questions so
um

00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at where it says state
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Rockingham district 10 on
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
this ballot in my community it would be
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
rocking it would be state representative
 
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:08.220 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 13. so then
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
underneath that in my community it would
 
00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
underneath that in my community it would
say

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:16.220 align:start position:0%
uh vote for not more than 10.
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
Representatives 10 Representatives will
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
be elected in this District vote for up
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
to 10. if there are more than a single
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
person to be voted for in that column
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
such as some House of Representative
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
districts would all of that be on the
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
ballot no
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
this is this is where the punctuation is
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
is lacking on on what you have before
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
you so what it would say is yeah that's
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's a bit much and yeah
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
um I think what it would really say
 
00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:50.099 align:start position:0%
under here is instead of vote for not
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
more than three
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
it would say
 
00:47:53.339 --> 00:47:54.530 align:start position:0%
it would say
uh

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
vote for up to three
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
and uh three three will be elected or it
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
might say yes I think that's that's
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
pretty concise
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
you could just say three will be elected
 
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
you know and put the uh vote for yeah I
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
think I think vote for not more than
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
three and three will be elected so that
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
sort of lets you know this is this is
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
your parameters these are your options
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.170 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
committee

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%

everybody I'm glad you all made it in
today

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
um let the committee know that uh in
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
speaking with the sponsor of this
 
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
legislation we are happy to work with
 
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
him and with you of the committee if
 
00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:21.349 align:start position:0%
him and with you of the committee if
you're

00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
um open to making the wording on the
 
00:49:25.849 --> 00:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
ballot more clear
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
um or more positive vote for up to
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
versus vote not for not more than
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
um the the sponsor of legislation is
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
aware and we have the discussion that
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
there's some missing
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
um punctuation and parentheses in the
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
wrong spots here but
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
um as to the chair's Point uh there is a
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
limited amount of space on the ballot so
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
if we can make whatever wording we do
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
change or we do add just to be very
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
minimal just to make sure that it's um
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
legible by the uh it's a voter can
 
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
easily read it and it's not too much
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
information where they wouldn't just
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
ignore it to begin with so
 
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the committee
 
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
a representative
 
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:08.829 align:start position:0%
a representative
um

00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know that's why I have like
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
question I was just wondering
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
and and I'm just maybe ignorant to why
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I believe
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's because the voter has the option to
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
vote for none one two or three or they
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
can they can vote for more than that if
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
they'd like to
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
um vote
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
um they are our lawyer in um the
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office often uses
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
the example of when he runs for dog
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
catcher and somebody's well his neighbor
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
says he's going to vote for him but his
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
neighbor also says he's going to vote
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
for promises vote to somebody else who's
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
running for dog catcher and he votes for
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
both of them he can honestly say I voted
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
for you so
 
00:50:58.559 --> 00:51:01.370 align:start position:0%
for you so
um

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:02.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
it just it tells the voter that they can
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
bullet vote if they want to I think I
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
think that's the reasoning behind it but
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's up to you as the legislature to
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
decide that that wording
 
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.549 align:start position:0%
decide that that wording
representative

00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:51:18.359 --> 00:51:19.549 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
along the lines of that question
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
does vote for up to does that imply they
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
have to vote for that number I'm just
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
asking because when I first read it it's
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
like what happens if they're sitting
 
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
there saying I don't want to vote for up
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
to three
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering does it create even
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
more confusion
 
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I I think I
 
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
would leave it up to the sponsor and
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
your committee and we're happy to give
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
our input as anything that can make it
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
clearer for the the voter as to how many
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
they can vote for
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
um and in a positive way perhaps the
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
word not is not a positive word to be in
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
there but
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know if uh representative
 
00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.309 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know if uh representative
wood

00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
wood
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:52:12.359 --> 00:52:13.069 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair

00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
how long have we been collecting the
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question since
 
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.589 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question since
November

00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:23.420 align:start position:0%
25 of 2020.
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
so it's this is new data do oh actually
 
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:27.980 align:start position:0%
September sorry
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
do you see do you believe there's a
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
problem with the number of under on the
 
00:52:33.599 --> 00:52:34.910 align:start position:0%
problem with the number of under on the
votes

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh from the data you've seen have you
 
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
looked at it do you see a lot of those I
 
00:52:41.569 --> 00:52:41.579 align:start position:0%
mean just
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
people handle numbers they they get a
 
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
sense I was just wondering now that
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
you're seeing these numbers for the
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
first time do you think there's a
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
problem with people reading this well
 
00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:55.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
um to what the sponsor of the bill said
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
and I think somebody else on the
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
committee alluded to is that as the as
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
you go down the ballot you get voter
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
fatigue a little bit and sometimes when
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
you flip over the ballot you might not
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
know what one of the county officers
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
does so you just
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't vote that way and especially in
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
vote for up to 10 or 13 or whatever have
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
you for state representatives
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
um you might not know that many people
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
and you want to vote for the ones you do
 
00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
know so I don't I don't know that
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's a problem on the with the
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
undervotes so much as just making sure
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
that it's clear that they can vote for
 
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:35.240 align:start position:0%
that many
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:53:37.319 --> 00:53:38.990 align:start position:0%
of course
um

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
100 in Bowman said that if we had 13 he
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
would expect to see that number uh
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
bigger would you agree with that from
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
the data you've seen yes I would
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
definitely agree with that okay thank
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
you that's really the question okay
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
further questions all right never
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
underestimate why voters do what they do
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
I mean after all they did vote for all
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
of us so uh thank you deputy secretary I
 
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:24.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%

01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
book relative to the deadline of
 
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis filing my nomination papers for
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
the state general elections uh
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative C welcome to election law
 
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
election law committee I'm
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Alvin C representing
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County District 26. I'm here
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
today to introduce House Bill 363 an act
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
relative to deadlines for the candidates
 
01:03:10.849 --> 01:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
filing by nomination papers for state
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
general elections
 
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
candidates filing by nomination papers
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
are running
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
either as an independent or as a part of
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
a minor political party
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
these candidates have four deadlines to
 
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
meet in order to get on state general
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
election ballot these deadlines are
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
currently based on the date of the
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
primary election
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
but these candidates are not
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
participating in the primary at all
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
so synchronizing the deadlines
 
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
to the primary is an odd way of doing
 
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.970 align:start position:0%
to the primary is an odd way of doing
things

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
and there's consideration for changing
 
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
the date of the primary so it makes
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
sense to decouple the petition process
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
from the primary election
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
and reference the several deadlines to
 
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
the date of the general election
 
01:03:59.089 --> 01:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
then regardless of whether or not the
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
date of the primary has changed stay
 
01:04:02.690 --> 01:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
possible unintended consequence may be
 
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.490 align:start position:0%
possible unintended consequence may be
avoided

01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
the first part of this bill changes the
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
filing of a declaration of intent
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
from when the party candidates must file
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
their for their primaries in early June
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
to the third Monday in July moving this
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
deadline from June to July is the only
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
notable change in this bill
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
this can help minor parties if they hold
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
nominating conventions which could be
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled as late as early summer
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
the other three deadlines for nomination
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
papers currently are each defined as a
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
certain number of weeks before the
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
primary election date this bill uses the
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
same weeks but will now Define them as
 
01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
certain weeks before the general
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
election instead of the primary election
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention to this
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll be happy to answer any
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
look at that you're getting off easy
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative C I have no
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
other pink cards for this bill
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
um representative wood will you grab the
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's time for a jaunt down to
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you and so once again it's a blank
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
sheet so with that I'm going to close

members of the committee my name is
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
Laura tolerski and I represent nashua's
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
Ward 8 which is Hillsboro 11.
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
today I present for your consideration
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
447fn relative to the purchase of
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
election equipment
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to create an
 
01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity for local municipalities to
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
receive some financial support through
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
existing Hava funds to pay for the
 
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
replacement of ballot counting devices
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
which we know will be coming as soon as
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
a new device is selected by the end of
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
the year
 
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
Additionally the bill would allow funds
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
to be used for other needed election
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
technology including electronic poll
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
books and secure laptops
 
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
we are all aware that the existing
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
accuvote machines are at the end of
 
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
their life span with software that is
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
outdated repairs being needed more often
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
and parts that are getting more
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to find
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is get towns in a
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
position to be able to replace these
 
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
dying machines and prevent an election
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
election day catastrophe such as a
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
machine failure that could result in
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
exhausting handcounts and delayed
 
01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.570 align:start position:0%
exhausting handcounts and delayed
results

01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:35:59.689 --> 01:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
development of town and City budgets are
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
always a challenge
 
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
and in a perfect world money would have
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
been set aside over the last few Cycles
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of this once in a 20 to
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
30 year purchase of ballot counting
 
01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.709 align:start position:0%
30 year purchase of ballot counting
machines

01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
but now with the state taking so long
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
and making a final decision there is
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
simply no time left
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
for many municipalities budgets are
 
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
being voted on in a matter of days and
 
01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.189 align:start position:0%
being voted on in a matter of days and
weeks

01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
and it's likely there will be
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities that won't be able to
 
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
purchase machines once the selection is
 
01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.450 align:start position:0%
purchase machines once the selection is
made

01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
this just isn't fair to our hard-working
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
election workers who will be faced with
 
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
exhausting hand counts
 
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
I've passed out to the committee I
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
handout that outlines the dedicated
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
we have extras for anyone here
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
showing the Hava balance over the last
 
01:36:56.940 --> 01:36:58.490 align:start position:0%
showing the Hava balance over the last
decade

01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
decade
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
on the cover sheet is an easier to read
 
01:37:00.659 --> 01:37:02.149 align:start position:0%
on the cover sheet is an easier to read
summary

01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
summary
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
and you can see that the balance has
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
dropped below 10 million dollars only
 
01:37:10.729 --> 01:37:10.739 align:start position:0%
twice in that time and never below nine
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing on a similar
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
Bill SB 73
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State expressed
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that they don't want to spend
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
down these funds as they maintain
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
certain election functions in their
 
01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:26.870 align:start position:0%
certain election functions in their
Department

01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
Department
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
with that in mind
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
I would be open to amending my bill
 
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
that would set a cap on the amount that
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
could be distributed to help towns
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
through this bill
 
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
why can't three to five million dollars
 
01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
be spent through this program providing
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
grants leaving a healthy balance not at
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
risk of running out
 
01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
with the current balance
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
of 11.9 million which was the balance as
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
of January 31st
 
01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
and with an expected one million dollar
 
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:02.990 align:start position:0%
and with an expected one million dollar
Grant

01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
that we are expecting to receive in
 
01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.709 align:start position:0%
that we are expecting to receive in
April

01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
April
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
we can still offer three million dollars
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
in relief to towns and have nearly 10
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars remaining
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
amending the bill to limit the amount of
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
grants in that way would allow this very
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
needed one-time relief for acquiring
 
01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
nuke technology while maintaining ahava
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
balance that the secretary would like to
 
01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:28.669 align:start position:0%
balance that the secretary would like to
see

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
while the ballot counting devices are
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
Paramount for towns this bill also would
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
allow funds to be spent on other
 
01:38:37.610 --> 01:38:37.620 align:start position:0%
Technologies such as electronic pull
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
books and secure laptops it is my
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that some supervisors of
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
the checklist need to access election
 
01:38:47.209 --> 01:38:47.219 align:start position:0%
net using their own personal devices
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
which poses an obvious security risk and
 
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
providing funds to be used on these
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
Technologies further secures our
 
01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.450 align:start position:0%
Technologies further secures our
elections

01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:38:58.250 --> 01:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
the special committee on voter
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
confidence report recommended replacing
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
our ballot counting devices and to use
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
state and federal funds so that
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the resources to
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
conduct efficient and secure elections
 
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses both of these
 
01:39:17.149 --> 01:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
concerns using Hava funds even nominally
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
will help our towns and be a significant
 
01:39:21.649 --> 01:39:21.659 align:start position:0%
investment for the state to build
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
confidence in the security and integrity
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
of our elections
 
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
these machines are not a want for towns
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
they are in need
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
I hope you will consider house bill
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
447fn as a way to provide necessary
 
01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
relief to our towns and election
 
01:39:39.950 --> 01:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
officials and I thank you for your time
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you and I apologize for my phone
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
that was not that was not intentional
 
01:39:46.610 --> 01:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
obviously uh representative
 
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh like three million
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
dollars or whatever but how do you think
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State Should allocate
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
the that amount of money going to Which
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
towns and Which towns would have more
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
access than other towns
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I trust that
 
01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the secretary of state has would be
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
able to address that question also but I
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
would imagine
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
um that there would be an understanding
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
um as to the number of machines each
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
Town currently uses
 
01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
um or each Town requires and
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
um I assume it would be based also on
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps the number of Voters that are in
 
01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
each district and they could develop
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
some kind of guidelines for that
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
coming from do you know I am unsure I
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
received that office from the Secretary
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
of State's office last week I'm sure
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
they could answer that question all
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
um I have just some kind of product
 
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
questions uh what is a secure laptop
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
what does that mean
 
01:40:56.689 --> 01:40:56.699 align:start position:0%
does that defined anywhere or is that
 
01:40:58.910 --> 01:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
just like I just looked at my pure
 
01:41:00.050 --> 01:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
laptops I don't I just don't know what
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
that means was that in my testimony or
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
I believe that would refer to
 
01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:12.410 align:start position:0%
I believe that would refer to
um

01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
a municipal laptop that is does not have
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
someone's um or
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
referring to what I said about uh
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
personal devices personal devices that
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
potentially did not have the needed
 
01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219 align:start position:0%
security and could be open to some kind
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
of breach okay um kind of a follow-up
 
01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
would you be okay if we either took the
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
word secure out or in some way just I
 
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
just feel like somebody's getting like
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm getting bogged down in it right now
 
01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
so like I feel like I just don't know
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
what a secure laptop that's fine I would
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
talk about somebody who talks about who
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
programs computers I just don't know
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
what that means like off offhand if
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's like a standard like there's a
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
fisma standard uh with the federal
 
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
government uh I I just don't know what
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
secure means I'm not trying to play
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
games I just literally just don't know
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
what it means I would leave that open to
 
01:41:57.290 --> 01:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
the uh committee okay thank you
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
um other questions about secure laptops
 
01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.950 align:start position:0%
um other questions about secure laptops
no

01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
all right next up is I'm having trouble
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
reading the last last name but natch
 
01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.330 align:start position:0%
reading the last last name but natch

01:42:16.679 --> 01:42:18.890 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
Nate Graves with the municipal
 
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
Association uh we support uh House Bill
 
01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.430 align:start position:0%
Association uh we support uh House Bill
447

01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
447
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
um it is the companion bill to Senate
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
Bill 73 I will note that for some reason
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
um LBA did not include a fiscal note
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
with this bill but there is one on
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 73 which you all may want to
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:40.609 align:start position:0%
take a look at
um

01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
I look in this this a little bit uh
 
01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
according to the data that I saw from
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office from
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
September of 2022 there were 195 towns
 
01:42:52.729 --> 01:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
and wards that use the accubote machines
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
um according to the fiscal note they
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
provided for the um Senate companion
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
bill direct replacement of those
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
machines would cost between six thousand
 
01:43:04.010 --> 01:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
and eight point five thousand per
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
machine that's a total of 1.17 to 1.65
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
million for just the new machines that
 
01:43:13.090 --> 01:43:13.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily include any sort of
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
Maintenance costs or you know any
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
contracts related to that that's just
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
the hardware itself
 
01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:19.790 align:start position:0%
the hardware itself
um

01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:22.609 --> 01:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
so that's really what our Focus would be
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
on is trying to find funding other than
 
01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:26.629 align:start position:0%
on is trying to find funding other than
um

01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
locally raised AKA taxpayer funding
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
um to replace those machines
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
um as as mentioned the Hava fund is a
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
potential option here I certainly don't
 
01:43:39.410 --> 01:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
have any objection if there are other
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
sources of funding that the legislature
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
wants to look at
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
um we're just we are aware of the fact
 
01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
um we're just we are aware of the fact
that

01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
for many years now the uh
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
company that has been servicing the
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
machines has said essentially at their
 
01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
end of life and we hope that the
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
ballotlaw commission will be quickly
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
wrapping up the process of certifying uh
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
new machines and so those will be able
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
to take the place of the machines that
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
are frankly older than I am
 
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
um and so we're hopeful that we can find
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
some sort of State funding or federal
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
funding sources so that we can quickly
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
replace those and have all of them ready
 
01:44:23.689 --> 01:44:23.699 align:start position:0%
to go for the next election
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
um whatever whatever election that may
 
01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:26.149 align:start position:0%
um whatever whatever election that may
be

01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
all right nope representative Kennedy
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
ask him for two dollars
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I probably should
 
01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
have asked this of the of the sponsor
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
but this is more just curiosity is do
 
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know how much money is available
 
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
from the help America vote Act of 2002.
 
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:51.179 align:start position:0%
so according to the fiscal note that was
 
01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 73 there was 12.7 million
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the Java fund I believe that was
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
prepared in late December early January
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if there were costs
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
um the November election that were just
 
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
paid out or not Secretary of State's
 
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
office would have to speak to that but
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's what was reported to the other
 
01:45:12.719 --> 01:45:14.810 align:start position:0%
that's what was reported to the other
body

01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:16.609 align:start position:0%
body
follow-up

01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the money available to us
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
12.7 million
 
01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:24.659 align:start position:0%
I would assume so
 
01:45:26.689 --> 01:45:26.699 align:start position:0%
a lot of money uh representative Brennan
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:45:28.679 --> 01:45:30.050 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:45:30.050 --> 01:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I think you mentioned your estimate
 
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
on how much the total cost would be for
 
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
a replacement of machines can you just
 
01:45:40.129 --> 01:45:40.139 align:start position:0%
clarify what that would be the total
 
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
number sure so there were 195 towns
 
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
rewards that that used the accubo
 
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
machines so the total number
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
with me doing the math was between 1.17
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
million and 1.65 million I think it
 
01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:57.659 align:start position:0%
depends on
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
um which uh vendor they they end up
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
certifying is as able to be replacing
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
if these Java funds are not made
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
available to municipalities to replace
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
these machines who pays for the
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
replacement of machines
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
that would be the local taxpayer
 
01:46:24.410 --> 01:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
representative Brian thank you sir uh
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
human nature being what it is
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't communities that currently do
 
01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
not use
 
01:46:38.689 --> 01:46:38.699 align:start position:0%
this kind of Technology electronic
 
01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
ballot counting machines consider this
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be some kind of free money since
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
previously they would have that
 
01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
Community would have had to pay for it
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
now they don't they're seeing that other
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
communities don't have to do that if
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's being paid for with Java funds and
 
01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:55.940 align:start position:0%
that would render these estimates
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
inaccurate at best
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that start happening so there
 
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.870 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that start happening so there
are

01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:03.530 align:start position:0%
are
um

01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
a total of 308 polling places throughout
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
the state 113 use hand count 195 use uh
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices
 
01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
at this point there wasn't specificity
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
in the bill as to how the secretary of
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
state would allocate those funds that
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
goes to representative bones question if
 
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
their interest was direct replacement
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
it would only be what I told you if it
 
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
was the case they wanted to open it up
 
01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.109 align:start position:0%
was the case they wanted to open it up
to

01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
um other the other 113 that we're
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
looking at it there's
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
potentially additional costs
 
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
I can't do math that quickly but I
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
assume the total cost of just the
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
machines without the maintenance would
 
01:47:46.850 --> 01:47:46.860 align:start position:0%
be somewhere
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
under 3 million
 
01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham
 
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for my
 
01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:47:58.570 --> 01:47:58.580 align:start position:0%
um who actually in the town will be
 
01:48:01.129 --> 01:48:01.139 align:start position:0%
approving these purchases
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
of the Machines of new machines or any
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
other devices so if it's a grant program
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
any sort of unanticipated it would be
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
considered unanticipated money it could
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
be accepted by the select board assuming
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
the select board has been authorized by
 
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
the town meeting to do so under RSA 3195
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
B and they could expend any of those
 
01:48:22.370 --> 01:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
Grant funds in line with the purpose of
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
the grant so that would be if it covered
 
01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
the whole the whole cost machine if
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of match or there's
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
some sort of local allocation that would
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
have to be done as part of the budgeting
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
process which would occur at town
 
01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.450 align:start position:0%
process which would occur at town
meeting

01:48:35.450 --> 01:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
obviously cities are different but okay
 
01:48:39.410 --> 01:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
further questions just representative
 
01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.709 align:start position:0%
further questions just representative
boom

01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
boom
 
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh you mentioned
 
01:48:48.669 --> 01:48:48.679 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
places that have the machines and be
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
replaced does that include you have a
 
01:48:57.770 --> 01:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
total number of machines not the total
 
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:00.179 align:start position:0%
number of talents
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
I can get you the link to the
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet from the Secretary of
 
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
State's website that gives you data
 
01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
about that I think it was 195 machines
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
total but I could be wrong about that I
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
know that was
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
the wards and towns it's possible that
 
01:49:21.169 --> 01:49:21.179 align:start position:0%
some awards have more than one machine
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
or they I know that they do I I don't
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
know that that was in my account
 
01:49:31.609 --> 01:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah and my question is
 
01:49:34.609 --> 01:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
the amount of money you said I mean
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we need for right is the
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
total number of machines that are going
 
01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
to pay for not the total number of
 
01:49:44.090 --> 01:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
towns or whatever
 
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
like I said I can give you the I I will
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
forward to the committee the uh the link
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
to the spreadsheet on the Secretary of
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
State's website that tells you which
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
town and how many machines
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
so you can check my math
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
all right it's pretty easy thank you
 
01:50:04.129 --> 01:50:04.139 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next up Olivia zinc with
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.050 --> 01:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee I
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
hope you all got here safely and we'll
 
01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
get home safely in the snowstorm
 
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Olivia Zink
 
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
I live in Franklin and I represent open
 
01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:22.739 align:start position:0%
democracy action
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
um a non-partisan non-profit based here
 
01:50:28.910 --> 01:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
in Concord local election officials are
 
01:50:31.129 --> 01:50:31.139 align:start position:0%
the Bedrock of our democracy and they
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
deserve more support House Bill 447
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
helps election workers with the
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
resources needed to replace ballot
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
devices we just heard that we have over
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
300 polling places I have the list
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
printed out of the 129 towns or
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
communities that have ballot counting
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
devices but my city the city of Franklin
 
01:50:56.209 --> 01:50:56.219 align:start position:0%
has three Wards three polling places and
 
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
three ballot counting devices
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
so this list just has the date of the
 
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
when the device was purchased not how
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
many devices each Community has so if
 
01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:10.139 align:start position:0%
there's another spreadsheet that would
 
01:51:11.590 --> 01:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
be great to have
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
Candia and Canterbury both purchase
 
01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
devices February 8
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
1996 so making those machines
 
01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
27 years old
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
they were purchased when I was in high
 
01:51:25.199 --> 01:51:26.770 align:start position:0%
they were purchased when I was in high
school

01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:26.780 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
it may be time for us to be looking at
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
new devices
 
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
we know due to an nhpr story
 
01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:39.860 align:start position:0%
um that the ballot counting devices
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
starting in 2024 State manufacturers
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
will no longer be able to produce parts
 
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:48.500 align:start position:0%
for the older models
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
these machines are in need of parts and
 
01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
services and will need to be replaced in
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
the next two years
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
as we've heard the Secretary of State's
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
office has 12.8 million dollars of Hava
 
01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
funds that could be used to out to
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
purchase these machines this grant
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
system might operate similar to the
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
cares Grant system during covid where
 
01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities were able to receive
 
01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
Grant monies in administering the
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
elections I urge you to please vote
 
01:52:19.209 --> 01:52:19.219 align:start position:0%
ought to pass if House Bill
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
447 and happy to take any questions
 
01:52:24.890 --> 01:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative Britain thank you and
 
01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
if these ballot counting devices fail in
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
2024 and there's no parts
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
what happens to the counting of ballots
 
01:52:42.290 --> 01:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
who who is doing that
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
the election workers would would do a
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
hand count if a if a device fails
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
follow up please of course
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
in Manchester
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
if there is a failure of
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
ballot counting machines in 2024 which
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
would be a presidential election which
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
I would think would result in a higher
 
01:53:11.149 --> 01:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
voter participation more ballots
 
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
do you know how long it would take
 
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
um election workers to hand count in in
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
a large municipality like a Manchester
 
01:53:22.129 --> 01:53:22.139 align:start position:0%
or or another
 
01:53:24.169 --> 01:53:24.179 align:start position:0%
um Manchester might be the wrong example
 
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
because I know that if a machine fails
 
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
in Manchester they've moved a machine
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
from a different polling place because
 
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester has multiple machines but say
 
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's dairy or another Bedford is another
 
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
large municipality it would take hours
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I would think that you would want to
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
pull a whole team in seven o'clock if
 
01:53:47.209 --> 01:53:47.219 align:start position:0%
you knew you were hand counting for hand
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
counting and I know that at least in
 
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
2022 Town clerks and moderators were in
 
01:53:57.229 --> 01:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
search of people to come in to do the
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
seven o'clock shift to help count so
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
that was a need
 
01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.149 align:start position:0%
that was a need
um

01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
and I think that it in other communities
 
01:54:09.649 --> 01:54:09.659 align:start position:0%
where there's smaller hand counts it
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
takes hours if not you know two or three
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the morning that you're there hand
 
01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
I remember from previous testimony that
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office had
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
talked about recruit the need to recruit
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
more volunteers for
 
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
um working elections
 
01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:32.629 align:start position:0%
um working elections
um

01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:32.639 --> 01:54:36.590 align:start position:0%
um
phrases

01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
if a large municipality is potentially
 
01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:42.229 align:start position:0%
if a large municipality is potentially
facing

01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
facing
 
01:54:42.239 --> 01:54:42.830 align:start position:0%
facing
um

01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
hours and hours and hours of hand
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
counting what do you think that would do
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
to the recruitment of election worker
 
01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:55.370 align:start position:0%
to the recruitment of election worker
volunteers

01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
um it's right now difficult to recruit
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
election workers I know I'm a single mom
 
01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
I work the polls in my community and I'm
 
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
lucky my mom takes my daughter overnight
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
on Election night because I say just
 
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
keep her overnight because I don't know
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
what time I'm going to be home but I
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
think that we're seeing more of that
 
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
grandparent generation age out of being
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
poll workers and the need to recruit
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
more Working Families and others to be
 
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:26.820 align:start position:0%
poll workers and I think that
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
as that transition begins to happen
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
where you have more working families
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
that have to get up and go to work most
 
01:55:35.209 --> 01:55:35.219 align:start position:0%
you know the next morning it's going to
 
01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
be hard to make a commitment to our
 
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
democracy that that needs to stay up
 
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
until several hours into the night I
 
01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:43.609 align:start position:0%
until several hours into the night I
know

01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
um I remember talking to representative
 
01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
Kathy holzel on this committee and she
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
said to me I was up until 3 A.M in
 
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:53.149 align:start position:0%
said to me I was up until 3 A.M in
Raymond

01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
Raymond
 
01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
um and she's like it's gonna take me a
 
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
couple of days to
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
feel like a normal human being again she
 
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
was back here in election law after that
 
01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
election but I do think we're not used
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
to working that many hours many I mean I
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
know in my town clerk went to work at
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
four in the morning to get the elections
 
01:56:16.129 --> 01:56:16.139 align:start position:0%
ready to be opened and worked until 4
 
01:56:18.590 --> 01:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
a.m during the primary and she worked a
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
24-hour day our town clerks are you know
 
01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:23.780 align:start position:0%
it happens every so often but I do think
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
what were the questions from the
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none thank
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
you next up representative Alvin C from
 
01:56:34.619 --> 01:56:43.010 align:start position:0%
you next up representative Alvin C from
Loudon

01:56:43.010 --> 01:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:56:47.570 --> 01:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
election law committee I just wanted to
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
point out that all the cities and towns
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
have already been notified that of the
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
pending obsolescence of the accuvote
 
01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:56.270 align:start position:0%
pending obsolescence of the accuvote
machines

01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:56.870 align:start position:0%
machines
um

01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
my town of Loudon has already
 
01:57:02.209 --> 01:57:02.219 align:start position:0%
been well our budget hasn't been
 
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
approved yet this year but in this
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
year's budget we'll have a line item for
 
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
new uh voting machines so
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
um Township and towns and cities should
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
be planning ahead and I don't think it's
 
01:57:19.689 --> 01:57:19.699 align:start position:0%
necessarily appropriate for
 
01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
the state to suddenly be giving grants
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
to towns that didn't plan ahead when
 
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
there are towns that are planning ahead
 
01:57:29.450 --> 01:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
by putting it in the ballot in their
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
budget this year or maybe next year
 
01:57:36.169 --> 01:57:36.179 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to pass that on thank
 
01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:38.219 align:start position:0%
you fair enough questions will you be
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
taking questions I'll take questions if
 
01:57:43.129 --> 01:57:43.139 align:start position:0%
there are any questions on the committee
 
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you next up McKenzie
 
01:57:55.129 --> 01:57:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
good morning member of the committee my
 
01:57:58.970 --> 01:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
name is Mackenzie St Germain I'm the
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
campaign director for the New Hampshire
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
campaign for voting rights and America
 
01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
votes New Hampshire I'm here today in
 
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
support of HB 447 this legislation is
 
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
really crucial to support our towns our
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
election officials and our overall
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
election infrastructure as we need to
 
01:58:14.810 --> 01:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
replace our aging ballot counting
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
devices and the current ballot counting
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
device we use New Hampshire cities and
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
towns was first introduced in 1989 as
 
01:58:23.209 --> 01:58:23.219 align:start position:0%
others have said soldier than them it's
 
01:58:25.729 --> 01:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
also older than me these devices are no
 
01:58:27.169 --> 01:58:27.179 align:start position:0%
longer built they're no longer available
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
for sale parts are no longer
 
01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
manufactured so any parts that are
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
needed need to be taken from old
 
01:58:36.010 --> 01:58:36.020 align:start position:0%
machines and put into functioning ones
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the president of LHS Associates
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
which is the company that Services the
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
accuvote devices expressed concerns
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
about the software used with the
 
01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
machines since they use Windows XP which
 
01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
is an operating system that has not been
 
01:58:52.729 --> 01:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
supported by Microsoft in years another
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
example of kind of the need for new ones
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut these devices are also
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
used their primary is in the summertime
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
they had a very hot primary day and the
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
devices started melting there are
 
01:59:06.850 --> 01:59:06.860 align:start position:0%
stories about this as we talk about
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
moving the primary potentially in the
 
01:59:10.609 --> 01:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
state these are all things we really
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
need to think about in terms of the
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
urgency of replacing these devices as
 
01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
soon as possible in 2022 Union Leader
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
article LHS associates also spoke before
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
the committee on voter competence they
 
01:59:24.770 --> 01:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
said their intention was to support this
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
machine through the 2024 election we are
 
01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
getting close to that date and that this
 
01:59:33.770 --> 01:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
techno technology is phasing out the
 
01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
system that we use although these
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
machines are still function functioning
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
and accurate New Hampshire communities
 
01:59:41.689 --> 01:59:41.699 align:start position:0%
are really fun working on borrowed time
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
right now if these devices need parts on
 
01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
Election Day or in the lead up to
 
01:59:48.050 --> 01:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
election day that are not available from
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
other machines if towns have software
 
01:59:52.490 --> 01:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
issues even large towns will need to
 
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.179 align:start position:0%
hand Count Their ballots which adds
 
01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
stress to our election officials and
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
also puts at risk are timely same night
 
02:00:01.010 --> 02:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
election results which New Hampshire
 
02:00:03.890 --> 02:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
voters expect and they should expect and
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
if folks are voting are counting until
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
early early in the morning that puts at
 
02:00:11.149 --> 02:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
risk those same night results and it
 
02:00:13.189 --> 02:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
also puts at risk voter confidence
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
the ballot commission is currently
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
working on certifying the new devices
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
but none have been approved yet so
 
02:00:22.189 --> 02:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
without support from the state's the
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
state towns will be required to purchase
 
02:00:26.089 --> 02:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
their own election equipment funding
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
these purchases from their own budgets
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
um the Secretary of State recently
 
02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
shared before this committee um your
 
02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
orientation I believe that there were
 
02:00:36.649 --> 02:00:36.659 align:start position:0%
12.8 million dollars in the America
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
Funds account
 
02:00:40.370 --> 02:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
um one of these specifically mentioned
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
uses for help America vote act funds on
 
02:00:44.810 --> 02:00:44.820 align:start position:0%
the help America vote act website which
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
is available for everyone to see is
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
replacing and updating voting systems so
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
this directly fits into the purpose of
 
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
those funds utilizing a purchase of
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
these already existing Hollow funds is a
 
02:00:59.330 --> 02:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible choice removes the
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
burden from town budgets and protects
 
02:01:03.410 --> 02:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
our election infrastructure you know I
 
02:01:04.970 --> 02:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
think I can assume everyone on this
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
committee has an interest in Saving
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars in making fiscally
 
02:01:11.209 --> 02:01:11.219 align:start position:0%
responsible decisions where we can and
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
utilizing funds that already exist to
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
fund these important purchases and this
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
bill does exactly that it makes sure
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
that our elections can continue to run
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
smoothly and supports the election
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and the election
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
officials who are really the backbone of
 
02:01:27.890 --> 02:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire elections finally I
 
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that this legislation does
 
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
meet two of the recommendations made by
 
02:01:33.290 --> 02:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
the special committee on voter
 
02:01:36.290 --> 02:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
confidence last year one was to replace
 
02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
our ballot accounting devices and the
 
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
other was to utilize state and federal
 
02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:42.060 align:start position:0%
funds to implement the report's
 
02:01:43.850 --> 02:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations and enable local
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
communities to have the resources needed
 
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:48.300 align:start position:0%
to conduct their elections so thank you
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
for your time and I am happy to answer
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
last up uh is the Secretary of State
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh representative wood can you go ahead
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.649 --> 02:02:12.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
02:02:14.570 --> 02:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David Scanlon Secretary of
 
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
State and I appear today in opposition
 
02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:18.050 align:start position:0%
State and I appear today in opposition
to

02:02:18.050 --> 02:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 447.
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
there are actually two issues being
 
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
discussed at this hearing today
 
02:02:29.410 --> 02:02:29.420 align:start position:0%
one more than others
 
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
the big factor is the the need or the
 
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
urgency to replace our existing ballot
 
02:02:37.570 --> 02:02:37.580 align:start position:0%
counting devices
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
it is an urgent issue I don't agree that
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
it as as urgent as has been expressed in
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony today
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
um you know we have time and the ballot
 
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
commission is aggressively working
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
towards the approval of a new device
 
02:02:57.729 --> 02:02:57.739 align:start position:0%
that could be put in place
 
02:03:01.689 --> 02:03:01.699 align:start position:0%
uh maybe by 2024 for some
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
communities but more likely something
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
that would be ready for 2026.
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
that issue however is being used as a
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
reason to raid the election fund which
 
02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
contains the federal Java Monies
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
supplied through the passage of the help
 
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
America vote act in 2003. and this is an
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
issue that has been coming before the
 
02:03:27.709 --> 02:03:27.719 align:start position:0%
legislature now for the last probably
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
half a dozen years if not more
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
and those states that have spent down
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
their Harbor funds on
 
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
items like this are now going before the
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
federal government asking for for more
 
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
money to fund their election processes
 
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
when the help America vote Act passed in
 
02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:51.350 align:start position:0%
when the help America vote Act passed in
2003

02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:53.209 --> 02:03:53.219 align:start position:0%
there were certain things that were
 
02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
required by the federal government one
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
that every state
 
02:04:00.530 --> 02:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
had or created a Statewide centralized
 
02:04:02.089 --> 02:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
voter database
 
02:04:03.890 --> 02:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
two that there would be accessible
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
voting equipment in every polling place
 
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
that there would be
 
02:04:12.649 --> 02:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
substantive poll worker training that
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
would take place as a result of those
 
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:17.820 align:start position:0%
funds voter education and then monies
 
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:19.860 align:start position:0%
available to the Attorney General's
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
office to enforce the provisions of the
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
at the time New Hampshire received about
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
17 million dollars as its share of those
 
02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
funds to get that job done
 
02:04:37.729 --> 02:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
and the legislature at the time created
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
the policy of allowing the Secretary of
 
02:04:43.490 --> 02:04:43.500 align:start position:0%
State's office to spend a portion of
 
02:04:47.089 --> 02:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
those funds on an annual basis to meet
 
02:04:48.410 --> 02:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the help America
 
02:04:49.930 --> 02:04:49.940 align:start position:0%
vote Act
 
02:04:53.410 --> 02:04:53.420 align:start position:0%
so that the funds could be kept
 
02:04:56.209 --> 02:04:56.219 align:start position:0%
ideally in perpetuity but as long as
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
possible before the monies would be
 
02:05:00.649 --> 02:05:00.659 align:start position:0%
spent down and we would have to tap
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
around state general fund our state
 
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to fund those programs
 
02:05:09.649 --> 02:05:09.659 align:start position:0%
so here we are 20 years after the help
 
02:05:14.089 --> 02:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
America vote Act passed we have a a fund
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
that is in excess of 12 million dollars
 
02:05:19.609 --> 02:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
at the moment that has allowed us to
 
02:05:19.619 --> 02:05:20.570 align:start position:0%
at the moment that has allowed us to
spend

02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
spend
 
02:05:22.490 --> 02:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
right around a million dollars every
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
year uh to administer the help America
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
vote act mandates
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
so what have we done uh with those
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
monies well uh we probably spent about
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
six million dollars of the initial funds
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
that we received early on
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
to create a brand new centralized voter
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
database and add uniformity to that
 
02:05:45.599 --> 02:05:47.570 align:start position:0%
database and add uniformity to that
process

02:05:47.570 --> 02:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:05:50.450 --> 02:05:50.460 align:start position:0%
we put an accessible voting system in
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
every polling place
 
02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
and we're currently on the third
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
generation of accessible voting
 
02:05:59.930 --> 02:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
equipment in the polling place and we're
 
02:06:02.930 --> 02:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
working on enhancements to that
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
those items are paid for out of the
 
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
election fund
 
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we have a an
 
02:06:13.689 --> 02:06:13.699 align:start position:0%
excellent poll worker training program
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
that we've been able to expand every
 
02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:17.870 align:start position:0%
that we've been able to expand every
year

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:06:20.930 --> 02:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh where uh individuals and and the
 
02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office travel
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh putting on training sessions for
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
local election officials
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that we have uh
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh started putting those trainings up uh
 
02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
online whether it's on YouTube or
 
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
whether they're WebEx trainings
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that they can be used multiple times
 
02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
in an election cycle
 
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
that training has to be updated every
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
year because of the laws that are passed
 
02:06:53.089 --> 02:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
by the legislature and those laws have
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
to be reflected in the training
 
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
materials that we put on I think all of
 
02:06:58.850 --> 02:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of the election
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
procedure manual and you've seen how
 
02:07:03.890 --> 02:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
thick that has gotten over the years but
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that is the result of the activity
 
02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
that we undertake with the funds with
 
02:07:14.570 --> 02:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
the federal government has given us
 
02:07:22.669 --> 02:07:22.679 align:start position:0%
additional funds over the years in
 
02:07:25.250 --> 02:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh to try and get my dates right but
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
around 2020 when cyber security was a
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
big issue we received a significant
 
02:07:32.689 --> 02:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
amount of money I believe was around
 
02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:34.940 align:start position:0%
three million dollars to address
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that were initiated by Foreign
 
02:07:41.209 --> 02:07:41.219 align:start position:0%
actors hacking into state election
 
02:07:41.219 --> 02:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
actors hacking into state election
databases

02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
databases
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
and so we use those funds to uh you know
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
put in place important protections uh
 
02:07:53.149 --> 02:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
penetration testing you know embedded
 
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
Security in our in our database and
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
02:07:58.970 --> 02:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
uh and then the balance of those funds
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh we were able to use to actually
 
02:08:04.609 --> 02:08:04.619 align:start position:0%
bring the balance of the fund up to
 
02:08:07.129 --> 02:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
where it should be because it had been
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
dropping over the years due to low
 
02:08:12.169 --> 02:08:12.179 align:start position:0%
interest rates
 
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
and then in 2022
 
02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:16.729 align:start position:0%
and then in 2022
um

02:08:16.729 --> 02:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it would have been 2020. it
 
02:08:20.570 --> 02:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
would have actually the security funds
 
02:08:22.089 --> 02:08:22.099 align:start position:0%
would have been probably around 2018
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
2020 we had the pandemic
 
02:08:28.070 --> 02:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
and we received an additional 3.2
 
02:08:31.250 --> 02:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars in federal funds for the
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic all of which except for uh
 
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
about three hundred thousand dollars we
 
02:08:39.729 --> 02:08:39.739 align:start position:0%
sent directly to the cities and towns
 
02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
through a grant process which was
 
02:08:42.179 --> 02:08:43.370 align:start position:0%
through a grant process which was
established

02:08:43.370 --> 02:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
established
 
02:08:45.890 --> 02:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
by the number of absentee ballots that a
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
community sent out we kept it simple
 
02:08:50.450 --> 02:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh the three hundred thousand dollars we
 
02:08:53.089 --> 02:08:53.099 align:start position:0%
had to use to hire a CPA firm
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
to keep track of the records of how
 
02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
those funds were being distributed so
 
02:08:59.810 --> 02:08:59.820 align:start position:0%
that we could meet the requirements of
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
of the federal audit that is required on
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
a on a regular basis uh on how those
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
hobble funds are spent
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 447 actually calls for a
 
02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
grant program I can tell you if we
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
initiate a program where we're receiving
 
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
applications for certain grants that
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
there is a tremendous amount of record
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
keeping that would go along with that
 
02:09:27.649 --> 02:09:27.659 align:start position:0%
not only at the state level but the
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
local level so that we have the
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
information required to provide to the
 
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
Feds that those monies were
 
02:09:39.410 --> 02:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:42.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:09:42.370 --> 02:09:42.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
getting ready to receive another Grant
 
02:09:52.729 --> 02:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
which is for security purposes primarily
 
02:09:56.530 --> 02:09:56.540 align:start position:0%
but it can be used for
 
02:09:59.689 --> 02:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
the other items that are appropriate to
 
02:10:04.070 --> 02:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
be spent with with Hava funds
 
02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:04.729 align:start position:0%
be spent with with Hava funds
um

02:10:04.729 --> 02:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:07.550 --> 02:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
and you know with those Monies to the
 
02:10:11.330 --> 02:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
extent that it's it is above and beyond
 
02:10:13.609 --> 02:10:13.619 align:start position:0%
the base amount that we need to Cape to
 
02:10:15.890 --> 02:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
keep to keep our programs running
 
02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
properly then there may be opportunities
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
to send that money back to the cities
 
02:10:23.930 --> 02:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
and towns my preference would be to do
 
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
it like we did with the pandemic funds
 
02:10:29.270 --> 02:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
that would be done in a uniform way so
 
02:10:31.490 --> 02:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
that the record keeping is straight
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing equipment or using
 
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
the money to provide equipment for our
 
02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
local communities
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
in the first instance it has always been
 
02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities of New Hampshire
 
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
have been responsible for conducting the
 
02:10:50.089 --> 02:10:50.099 align:start position:0%
elections in the state
 
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
it is a local decision on whether a town
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
or city is going to hand count its
 
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
ballots or use a ballot counting device
 
02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:01.089 align:start position:0%
ballots or use a ballot counting device
um

02:11:01.089 --> 02:11:01.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
they many of the larger towns are using
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
the ballot counting devices because it
 
02:11:08.209 --> 02:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
saves them money
 
02:11:10.609 --> 02:11:10.619 align:start position:0%
and therefore it should continue in my
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
opinion to be a local decision on
 
02:11:15.169 --> 02:11:15.179 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to purchase those
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
machines or not
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh the same is true with electronic poll
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
books is that even though they have not
 
02:11:25.609 --> 02:11:25.619 align:start position:0%
been completely approved for use in New
 
02:11:28.129 --> 02:11:28.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they can be used as long as
 
02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:30.900 align:start position:0%
they have a parallel process of
 
02:11:33.410 --> 02:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
maintaining their checklist in the event
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
that they break down and there have been
 
02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
failures of those devices elsewhere
 
02:11:39.729 --> 02:11:39.739 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
02:11:43.689 --> 02:11:43.699 align:start position:0%
the towns that are using them the 16
 
02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
polling places that are using them find
 
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
that they are saving the town money
 
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
because it is making the lines obtaining
 
02:11:55.729 --> 02:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
to obtain a ballot move faster at the
 
02:11:57.649 --> 02:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
end of the night they simply have to
 
02:12:00.129 --> 02:12:00.139 align:start position:0%
push a couple of buttons on the keypad
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
and the number of Voters that checked in
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
is is instant they don't have to go
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
through the individual pages of the mark
 
02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:09.129 align:start position:0%
through the individual pages of the mark
checklist

02:12:09.129 --> 02:12:09.139 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
counting those numbers up
 
02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then we are
 
02:12:17.209 --> 02:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
finalizing the process of developing
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
inter an interface so that the
 
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
communities that are using the
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
electronic poll books can actually
 
02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
upload the data that they've collected
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
in the poll book to our voter database
 
02:12:31.729 --> 02:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
thereby saving the supervisors of the
 
02:12:33.550 --> 02:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
checklist a tremendous amount of time
 
02:12:35.890 --> 02:12:35.900 align:start position:0%
and effort
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
re-entering that data into their laptops
 
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
so there's more savings that are
 
02:12:42.669 --> 02:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
realized there
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that that the state
 
02:12:50.089 --> 02:12:50.099 align:start position:0%
has been incredibly responsible using
 
02:12:52.069 --> 02:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
those hobba funds in a very efficient
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
and effective way and I think it would
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
be very short-sighted if we start making
 
02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
attempts to spend down that money on
 
02:13:06.010 --> 02:13:06.020 align:start position:0%
one-time things putting us in danger of
 
02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
reaching the point where we can't
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
sustain that fund because in the end uh
 
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers have to have to fund the
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
bill and if we spend down all the Hava
 
02:13:20.689 --> 02:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
funds we're going to be asking for over
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
a million dollars every year
 
02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
from the general fund
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
if the issue of funding equal books not
 
02:13:32.689 --> 02:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
equal books but the ballot counting
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
devices is
 
02:13:38.589 --> 02:13:38.599 align:start position:0%
urgent and important public policy
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
and you know it's the desire of this
 
02:13:44.689 --> 02:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
committee to address that then then I
 
02:13:46.430 --> 02:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
would suggest that you request those
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
monies from the general fund and keep
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
our election fund healthy to do the job
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
that we have been doing right along and
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
with that Mr chairman I'd be happy to
 
02:13:57.410 --> 02:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
answer any questions questions from the
 
02:13:57.420 --> 02:13:58.910 align:start position:0%
answer any questions questions from the
committee

02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
02:14:05.330 --> 02:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Mr secretary
 
02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:06.350 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Mr secretary
um

02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:09.890 --> 02:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
I understand the need for conserving a
 
02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
large amount of the funds but my
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this bill would
 
02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
only ask for a portion say two to three
 
02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:18.410 align:start position:0%
only ask for a portion say two to three
million

02:14:18.410 --> 02:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:14:20.930 --> 02:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
which is above that excess that we've
 
02:14:23.569 --> 02:14:23.579 align:start position:0%
had before is that not your reading of
 
02:14:25.609 --> 02:14:25.619 align:start position:0%
the bill or is there something that I'm
 
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
missing well that's the way I understand
 
02:14:31.010 --> 02:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment that may be proposed I did
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
not read that into the bill
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
even so
 
02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:38.569 align:start position:0%
even so
um

02:14:38.569 --> 02:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.569 --> 02:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
I I I think that that the Secretary of
 
02:14:43.609 --> 02:14:43.619 align:start position:0%
State's office and the state has managed
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
those funds effectively if there is an
 
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
excess in there that we determine that
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
we can help you know one-time program
 
02:14:54.109 --> 02:14:54.119 align:start position:0%
that won't need to be sustained in the
 
02:14:56.089 --> 02:14:56.099 align:start position:0%
future then we'll certainly take a look
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:03.649 --> 02:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Hamer thank you
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:15:10.970 --> 02:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the tabulators
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
that we use in Manchester's 12 Wards are
 
02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
on their last legs
 
02:15:21.530 --> 02:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
I am aware that every accuvote counting
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
device is near the end of its useful
 
02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.169 align:start position:0%
device is near the end of its useful
life

02:15:27.169 --> 02:15:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.569 --> 02:15:28.579 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:15:31.129 --> 02:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
representative Barnum
 
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
secretary I have a question about the um
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
the revenue and fund sources
 
02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:42.589 align:start position:0%
the revenue and fund sources
um

02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
so it looks like interest is what's a
 
02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
revenue and also the portion of sales
 
02:15:50.450 --> 02:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
Statewide checklists
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
is that correct is there are there any
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
other revenues that incorporate in that
 
02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:56.330 align:start position:0%
other revenues that incorporate in that
total

02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
total
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
those are the I'll call them the regular
 
02:16:04.689 --> 02:16:04.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources for the election fund
 
02:16:07.490 --> 02:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
when the federal government makes
 
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
additional monies available through the
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
help America vote act
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
they usually require a match of some
 
02:16:17.990 --> 02:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
kind so the million dollars that is
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
coming available requires a 20 match
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
so we will come up with two hundred
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars uh from somewhere and
 
02:16:31.010 --> 02:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
it may be uh other monies other state
 
02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
monies that we use for technology
 
02:16:35.570 --> 02:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
related to elections that we can credit
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
towards that but I believe we have to
 
02:16:41.570 --> 02:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
pass that through the election fund so
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
that so that the uh so that we can make
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
the proper credit uh on the books for
 
02:16:49.389 --> 02:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
receiving you know for making the match
 
02:16:52.629 --> 02:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
requirement of those funds
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
02:16:59.089 --> 02:16:59.099 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh the question on the new
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
machines that you're looking at now you
 
02:17:04.490 --> 02:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
know what the cost will be for those
 
02:17:04.500 --> 02:17:06.589 align:start position:0%
know what the cost will be for those
machines

02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:06.599 align:start position:0%
machines
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the cost is
 
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
somewhere between six thousand and nine
 
02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per machine and it it
 
02:17:16.969 --> 02:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
will depend on which one the battle law
 
02:17:16.979 --> 02:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
will depend on which one the battle law
Commission

02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.610 align:start position:0%
Commission
approves

02:17:19.610 --> 02:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
approves
 
02:17:22.009 --> 02:17:22.019 align:start position:0%
they may approve to I don't know that it
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
makes sense to approve more than that
 
02:17:26.089 --> 02:17:26.099 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is a small market
 
02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
for those machines and
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
the problem with the newer I won't say
 
02:17:32.450 --> 02:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
the problem I mean the the technology
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
that comes with the newer machines is
 
02:17:37.250 --> 02:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
great I mean it their digital scan
 
02:17:40.009 --> 02:17:40.019 align:start position:0%
devices as opposed to Optical scan which
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
means that the newer devices can
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
actually record an image of every single
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
ballot that goes through
 
02:17:49.310 --> 02:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
but the but the companies that make
 
02:17:52.730 --> 02:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
those want to sell a a an election
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
system not just the machine and so we're
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
going to have to do some negotiating to
 
02:18:00.290 --> 02:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
get what we want and not what they would
 
02:18:02.570 --> 02:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
like to sell us because those additional
 
02:18:05.330 --> 02:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
systems are quite a bit more expensive
 
02:18:07.730 --> 02:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up and I will flag for
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
the committee we have to be back at one
 
02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
o'clock right so if you do want to break
 
02:18:11.939 --> 02:18:13.250 align:start position:0%
o'clock right so if you do want to break
uh

02:18:13.250 --> 02:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:16.250 --> 02:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
expediency what is the I remember when
 
02:18:19.849 --> 02:18:19.859 align:start position:0%
we first bought our machine in early 90s
 
02:18:24.110 --> 02:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
it was 7 500 what's the current cost of
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
an accubo machine the last that you know
 
02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:28.129 align:start position:0%
an accubo machine the last that you know
of

02:18:28.129 --> 02:18:28.139 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
course uh
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
yeah I I really don't have a good enough
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
I thought it was less than that
 
02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:40.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
um representative Lane
 
02:18:44.509 --> 02:18:44.519 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
secretary again
 
02:18:49.490 --> 02:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
um are there other funds available
 
02:18:51.049 --> 02:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
that are coming maybe from the federal
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
government that might be available to
 
02:18:58.730 --> 02:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.969 --> 02:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
not that I am aware of sometimes the
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:19:06.290 --> 02:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
makes monies available but I'm not aware
 
02:19:09.169 --> 02:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
of any current grants or offerings that
 
02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
they're making
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien
 
02:19:14.810 --> 02:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a lot of questions I'll
 
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
try to
 
02:19:19.730 --> 02:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
I went back and looked at the original
 
02:19:26.450 --> 02:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
Mandate of the Hava funds from 2002 or
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
three when it was passed
 
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
and it was really targeting the
 
02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
um the ballots that had the Punch Cards
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
and those one they wanted to those
 
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
replaced because of course what they had
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
just gone through
 
02:19:42.290 --> 02:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
are states replacing machine with
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting machines now
 
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
is that mandate kind of expanded to
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
replace that and our states doing that
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
as a general course they're replacing
 
02:19:54.410 --> 02:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
machines like this and are other states
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing that right right now
 
02:19:59.929 --> 02:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
when when Java originally passed one of
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
the excuse me
 
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
one of the provisions uh in there was
 
02:20:08.290 --> 02:20:08.300 align:start position:0%
that the states that used the punch card
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
ballot counting method had to replace
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
them New Hampshire didn't fall into that
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
category at the time many states had a
 
02:20:19.490 --> 02:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration database
 
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire did not so that's where
 
02:20:23.650 --> 02:20:23.660 align:start position:0%
those funds went
 
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
when some of the states
 
02:20:30.050 --> 02:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
and in States outside of New England a
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the election organizations are
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
done by County not by the Secretary of
 
02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
State as a as a whole but many of those
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
election Administration entities replace
 
02:20:44.750 --> 02:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
the punch cards with
 
02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:46.130 align:start position:0%
the punch cards with
um

02:20:46.130 --> 02:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:49.969 --> 02:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
just uh electronic recording devices no
 
02:20:53.450 --> 02:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
paper ballots and so uh you know they
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
perched they used the money to purchase
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
those and of course over time those fell
 
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
out of favor because of uh you know no
 
02:21:02.929 --> 02:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
no paper receipt or paper record and so
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
they ended up having to replace those as
 
02:21:04.680 --> 02:21:05.570 align:start position:0%
they ended up having to replace those as
well

02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
the short answer to your question though
 
02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
is yes some states are using Java funds
 
02:21:13.969 --> 02:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:13.979 --> 02:21:16.429 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you'll be able to answer
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
this but I I did the math based on all
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers that were being thrown out
 
02:21:26.929 --> 02:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
of 9 000 machines I'm not that nine
 
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per machine times 308
 
02:21:32.570 --> 02:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
because I was thinking that many current
 
02:21:34.969 --> 02:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
hand count towns would want to take
 
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of these funds
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
if they were available but that's not
 
02:21:41.929 --> 02:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
really the whole picture that would that
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
does not include towns such as mine
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
Dairy I think we have eight six or eight
 
02:21:48.410 --> 02:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
I can't recall ballot counting machines
 
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
Manchester I don't know how many ballot
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
counting machines they have so that
 
02:21:55.130 --> 02:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
fee that I came up with of about three
 
02:21:56.929 --> 02:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars would actually be much
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
greater when you consider towns that
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
would want to replace many machines
 
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
is that correct do you know how many
 
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
machines that would are online right now
 
02:22:09.889 --> 02:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
for example I think I would agree with
 
02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
you from the standpoint that if the
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
state were going to pay for the machines
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
that there would be towns that don't
 
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
currently have ballot counting devices
 
02:22:20.590 --> 02:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
that would want them
 
02:22:24.290 --> 02:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
but I think you do reach a point where
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
the town becomes so small that it's
 
02:22:28.990 --> 02:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
still faster to count ballots by hand
 
02:22:31.790 --> 02:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
you know the cost benefit just wouldn't
 
02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
be there
 
02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:33.650 align:start position:0%
be there
um

02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:37.010 --> 02:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
and then I think the towns that
 
02:22:40.250 --> 02:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
currently use them probably have the
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
number of ballot counting devices that
 
02:22:44.690 --> 02:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
they need so I wouldn't see a large
 
02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:46.210 align:start position:0%
they need so I wouldn't see a large
increase

02:22:46.210 --> 02:22:46.220 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
from the towns that currently have them
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
wanting more just because the state was
 
02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
paying for it
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to close we've we've got
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
to go we'll be back at one
 
02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
um unless you want to recess this and
 
02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
well last one
 
02:23:08.929 --> 02:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:23:12.650 --> 02:23:12.660 align:start position:0%
question can you clarify the amount of
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
java funds that are currently available
 
02:23:18.429 --> 02:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
we've heard a few different numbers 12.8
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
11.9 12.9 I just want to make sure that
 
02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:23.870 align:start position:0%
11.9 12.9 I just want to make sure that
I'm

02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
understanding where we currently stand
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the Java balance
 
02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
so the number that that I have on the
 
02:23:33.530 --> 02:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet printed from our
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:41.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:23:41.399 --> 02:23:42.650 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
um I have I have questions secretary
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
scan that I'm not going to hold the
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee with it I will announce the
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to send you in
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
writing and it basically expresses my
 
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
frustration with this process which is
 
02:23:53.809 --> 02:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
what is taking so long with the machines
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
I don't want the answer now I'm going to
 
02:23:57.050 --> 02:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
send it to you in writing but I think
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
that is kind of the Crux of this bill
 
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm going to close the
 
02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
hearing we will be back at one o'clock
 
03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:21.650 --> 03:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
all right it's one o'clock we don't need
 
03:03:22.730 --> 03:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
a quorum
 
03:03:25.250 --> 03:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
as we found out earlier today
 
03:03:28.370 --> 03:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
um gonna open up the hearing on House
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 590 allowing the removal political
 
03:03:32.330 --> 03:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
advertisements containing a candidate's
 
03:03:34.010 --> 03:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
name and which appear to be the
 
03:03:35.330 --> 03:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
candidates advertising on public
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
property by the candidate uh
 
03:03:39.230 --> 03:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative boam Committee Member
 
03:03:43.429 --> 03:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:45.830 --> 03:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:03:48.290 --> 03:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the election law
 
03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:55.929 --> 03:03:55.939 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Ralph Baum Hillsboro district 14
 
03:03:58.610 --> 03:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
the town of Litchfield
 
03:04:01.070 --> 03:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is fairly simple and adds to
 
03:04:05.450 --> 03:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
RSA 66417 starting online
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
12 in the amendment
 
03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
and any political advertising on public
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
property bearing the Canada's name and
 
03:04:13.969 --> 03:04:13.979 align:start position:0%
that appears to be the candidate
 
03:04:16.610 --> 03:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
advertising may be removed by the
 
03:04:19.250 --> 03:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
candidate we've all seen this seen the
 
03:04:22.010 --> 03:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
ads they've been around for years many
 
03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
years ago in my Senate District there
 
03:04:25.969 --> 03:04:25.979 align:start position:0%
was a candidate named Cruz
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
the weekend before the election signs
 
03:04:29.929 --> 03:04:29.939 align:start position:0%
were placed directly in front of the
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
Canada sign
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
like that much with an identical looking
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
sign that said vote Crews you lose
 
03:04:40.010 --> 03:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
despicable this past election there are
 
03:04:42.530 --> 03:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of signs against Caroline Levitt
 
03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
and Don bulldog and others KKK Airline
 
03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
for one
 
03:04:49.550 --> 03:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
signs saying the Cannons were against
 
03:04:51.650 --> 03:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
before something they weren't
 
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
since these signs were made to look like
 
03:04:56.210 --> 03:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
the candidate signs and after the
 
03:04:58.130 --> 03:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
election if left up the candidate would
 
03:05:00.530 --> 03:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
probably be blamed so this bill will
 
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
allow the Cannons to remove those signs
 
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
some people believe that the end
 
03:05:07.370 --> 03:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
justifies the means
 
03:05:10.429 --> 03:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't matter how we all talk
 
03:05:13.309 --> 03:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
about Fair election this isn't fair this
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill bill will make it a waste of money
 
03:05:19.130 --> 03:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
to do this false advertising and but if
 
03:05:21.830 --> 03:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
not then I will be signing buying signs
 
03:05:25.969 --> 03:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
next year and thank you okay will you be

forgotten to give you the paint card
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
um we uh opposed this bill uh we are
 
03:34:08.090 --> 03:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
03:34:09.590 --> 03:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
um some of the things that I know that
 
03:34:11.570 --> 03:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
the deputy secretary is going to gonna
 
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
03:34:15.229 --> 03:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
um but realistically when it comes to
 
03:34:16.610 --> 03:34:16.620 align:start position:0%
the right to know law
 
03:34:17.990 --> 03:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
I know this isn't the committee that
 
03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
typically handles those that's typically
 
03:34:21.950 --> 03:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary but when it comes to the right
 
03:34:23.990 --> 03:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
to know law if you if you as a citizen
 
03:34:26.630 --> 03:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
make a request of your municipality or
 
03:34:29.210 --> 03:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
other governmental body to
 
03:34:31.130 --> 03:34:31.140 align:start position:0%
um look at records They realistically
 
03:34:33.290 --> 03:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
have two options they can either let you
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
access the original records or they can
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
give you a copy of those records
 
03:34:40.670 --> 03:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
um in the context of ballots Our concern
 
03:34:43.010 --> 03:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
would be and voted ballots are concerned
 
03:34:44.570 --> 03:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
would be that if we're allowing people
 
03:34:46.729 --> 03:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
access to records there is a provision
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the right to know law that they can
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
do things like take notes and
 
03:34:53.210 --> 03:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
um and do other things which means they
 
03:34:55.309 --> 03:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
will always have one of these with them
 
03:34:58.370 --> 03:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
so they will always have the ability to
 
03:35:01.429 --> 03:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
do something untoward uh to the ballot
 
03:35:03.830 --> 03:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
so there's always the opportunity that
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
they could have some sort of impact on
 
03:35:09.050 --> 03:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
those voted ballots obviously we have a
 
03:35:10.849 --> 03:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated system in place that
 
03:35:12.889 --> 03:35:12.899 align:start position:0%
voted ballots are sealed they're kept in
 
03:35:15.170 --> 03:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
a sealed location and I'm sure the
 
03:35:17.570 --> 03:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary can can go into great
 
03:35:19.550 --> 03:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
detail about that whole process which
 
03:35:22.190 --> 03:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature adopted last year to
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have those records in
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
case we need to do a recount and we know
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
that those records are kept uh in a
 
03:35:31.070 --> 03:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
manner that they will that that we can
 
03:35:34.190 --> 03:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
get an accurate count if we need to do a
 
03:35:34.200 --> 03:35:35.210 align:start position:0%
get an accurate count if we need to do a
recount

03:35:35.210 --> 03:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
recount
 
03:35:39.530 --> 03:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
so that covers the access portion to the
 
03:35:41.030 --> 03:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
to the records
 
03:35:42.889 --> 03:35:42.899 align:start position:0%
and the flip side of that is the copy
 
03:35:45.410 --> 03:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
option where the municipality could
 
03:35:48.469 --> 03:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
provide copies of all of the ballots
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
um that's going to be an enormous cost
 
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
both in terms of time and money if you
 
03:35:56.990 --> 03:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
think about any any election with all of
 
03:35:59.750 --> 03:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
the election workers working there they
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
would have to access the sealed ballots
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
in a manner that allows them to keep
 
03:36:08.330 --> 03:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
track of those make copies of those in
 
03:36:10.729 --> 03:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
some Manner and provide those to purpose
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
of the right to know law when the
 
03:36:16.130 --> 03:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
purpose as stated is to let the people
 
03:36:18.710 --> 03:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
know what the government is doing so the
 
03:36:19.849 --> 03:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
only thing they're going to learn from
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
the voted ballots is something that the
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
local election officials and the
 
03:36:24.590 --> 03:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office have already
 
03:36:26.870 --> 03:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
disclosed which is how many people in
 
03:36:30.110 --> 03:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
your in your town in your ward voted for
 
03:36:32.030 --> 03:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
who which they already know because we
 
03:36:33.889 --> 03:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
we already did a count we did any
 
03:36:35.690 --> 03:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
recounts that may have been requested
 
03:36:37.729 --> 03:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
and the election results were already
 
03:36:41.090 --> 03:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
certified so there's nothing here that
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
that would that would reveal anything
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
about the governmental activities
 
03:36:47.040 --> 03:36:47.630 align:start position:0%
about the governmental activities
um

03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
and so for those reasons we we oppose
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
that and I'm happy to answer any
 
03:36:53.690 --> 03:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
questions any committee members may have
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:36:57.530 --> 03:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you and
 
03:36:59.809 --> 03:36:59.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's my
 
03:37:02.330 --> 03:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
understanding from reading 91a and
 
03:37:04.849 --> 03:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm wrong that
 
03:37:10.429 --> 03:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
um 91a does not specify that only
 
03:37:12.170 --> 03:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
Granite Cedars only New Hampshire
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
residents can file requests it's my
 
03:37:17.090 --> 03:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
um any citizen and my reading of it
 
03:37:22.670 --> 03:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
would be any American citizen would be
 
03:37:26.990 --> 03:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
able to file a 91a right to know request
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
for ballots if this bill were to be
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
passed into law is that correct
 
03:37:35.450 --> 03:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
so there's no definition in the statute
 
03:37:37.969 --> 03:37:37.979 align:start position:0%
about the word citizen
 
03:37:41.570 --> 03:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
um it's possible that it only relates to
 
03:37:43.250 --> 03:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens it's possible
 
03:37:45.469 --> 03:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
it's U.S citizens there's a U.S Supreme
 
03:37:49.150 --> 03:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
Court case where the Supreme Court cited
 
03:37:52.610 --> 03:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
91a and suggested that it meant New
 
03:37:54.889 --> 03:37:54.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens of course that's the
 
03:37:56.450 --> 03:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
U.S Supreme Court they don't interpret
 
03:37:58.010 --> 03:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law that would be the New
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court we don't have a
 
03:38:01.429 --> 03:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
ruling on that yet so I couldn't give
 
03:38:03.530 --> 03:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
you a definite answer follow-up please
 
03:38:05.210 --> 03:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
of course
 
03:38:08.269 --> 03:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
given that there's no ruling yet on that
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
would it be reasonable to expect that
 
03:38:17.690 --> 03:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
um someone from across the country any
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
someone affiliated with any group
 
03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:22.250 align:start position:0%
someone affiliated with any group
um

03:38:22.250 --> 03:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
would be able to make the case that they
 
03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire state law would be
 
03:38:31.370 --> 03:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
able to file a right to no request and
 
03:38:34.370 --> 03:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
would this bill given the language in
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:41.469 --> 03:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
a multitude of requests from
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
out-of-state entities
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
I think that's possible I will tell you
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
under the existing existing law there
 
03:38:53.570 --> 03:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
are frequently requests that come from
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
out of state which we know are from out
 
03:38:56.330 --> 03:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
of state because typically they're
 
03:38:59.389 --> 03:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
companies asking for typically Planning
 
03:39:01.729 --> 03:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
and Zoning records because they package
 
03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
those up and resell those so those
 
03:39:05.570 --> 03:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
frequently come from companies in
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
Florida and California elsewhere
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh it uh it obviously would be the case
 
03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
that anyone anywhere could could make
 
03:39:13.729 --> 03:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
that type of request and then it would
 
03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
be a question of how we respond to it
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
and what type of litigation what's the
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
cost of that litigation the results from
 
03:39:19.680 --> 03:39:20.990 align:start position:0%
cost of that litigation the results from
that

03:39:20.990 --> 03:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you can I just have one more
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
03:39:27.170 --> 03:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
our municipalities currently
 
03:39:27.180 --> 03:39:28.490 align:start position:0%
our municipalities currently
um

03:39:28.490 --> 03:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
are there some municipalities that
 
03:39:37.190 --> 03:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
struggle to fulfill 91a requests at this
 
03:39:39.530 --> 03:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
time is there a struggle that
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities face yes so they're all
 
03:39:46.969 --> 03:39:46.979 align:start position:0%
required to respond to 91a requests the
 
03:39:48.889 --> 03:39:48.899 align:start position:0%
issue comes when you have of what I
 
03:39:50.570 --> 03:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
would call voluminous requests which
 
03:39:52.250 --> 03:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
means that they're asking if the
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
requester is asking for a large volume
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
of Records so typically you see this in
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
the context of you know they request all
 
03:40:00.769 --> 03:40:00.779 align:start position:0%
the emails to and from the Town
 
03:40:02.510 --> 03:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
Administrator for the last six months
 
03:40:05.150 --> 03:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
that's a huge volume that has to be
 
03:40:06.710 --> 03:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
captured it has to be soared through
 
03:40:08.809 --> 03:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
anything that's you know going to have
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
private information is going to have to
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
be redacted removed from those records
 
03:40:15.650 --> 03:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
before it's handed over that those type
 
03:40:18.889 --> 03:40:18.899 align:start position:0%
of undertakings typically result in the
 
03:40:22.010 --> 03:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
town hiring and ex usually their Law
 
03:40:24.050 --> 03:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
Firm to come in and do that that's
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
obviously in the cost of tens of
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and municipalities
 
03:40:31.130 --> 03:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
do see this on a pretty frequent basis
 
03:40:33.530 --> 03:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
so there is a definite struggle there if
 
03:40:35.450 --> 03:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
you're looking at something
 
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be comparative
 
03:40:40.010 --> 03:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
comparable in terms of volume of the
 
03:40:41.330 --> 03:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
type of Records you're going through
 
03:40:43.729 --> 03:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a little bit different
 
03:40:47.210 --> 03:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
because it's ballots but still someone's
 
03:40:49.130 --> 03:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
gonna have to go through and copy each
 
03:40:50.330 --> 03:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
03:40:52.490 --> 03:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
and somehow annotate it in a way that
 
03:40:54.170 --> 03:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
they are going to understand you know
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
I've already copied that box I need to
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
move to this box that which is just
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a logistical headache one
 
03:41:03.130 --> 03:41:03.140 align:start position:0%
more it's fun
 
03:41:06.650 --> 03:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
would ballots requesting to view all
 
03:41:09.250 --> 03:41:09.260 align:start position:0%
ballots be considered a voluminous
 
03:41:11.809 --> 03:41:11.819 align:start position:0%
request for
 
03:41:11.819 --> 03:41:13.610 align:start position:0%
request for
c1a

03:41:13.610 --> 03:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
c1a
 
03:41:16.010 --> 03:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
I use the term voluminous request that's
 
03:41:19.130 --> 03:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
not in the statute I would consider it a
 
03:41:21.530 --> 03:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
voluminous request but I don't know that
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
everyone would agree with me on that one
 
03:41:25.250 --> 03:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you I'm going to
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
have you sit down we're going to bring
 
03:41:29.330 --> 03:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
you back we're not done with you yet the
 
03:41:31.969 --> 03:41:31.979 align:start position:0%
sponsor is here so we'll get the sponsor
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
and sponsor intent for this bill and
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
then we'll bring you back up if that's
 
03:41:35.819 --> 03:41:37.910 align:start position:0%
then we'll bring you back up if that's
okay

03:41:37.910 --> 03:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:41:40.130 --> 03:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
welcome to election law thank you sorry
 
03:41:42.170 --> 03:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
trained to be in two places at the same
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
time for two different Bill hearings
 
03:41:45.359 --> 03:41:47.630 align:start position:0%
time for two different Bill hearings
um

03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.610 --> 03:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative hole serving the towns of
 
03:41:52.130 --> 03:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton Hooksett Allentown and epsom
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of House Bill 387 right
 
03:41:56.690 --> 03:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
permitting ballots to be viewed under a
 
03:41:58.610 --> 03:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
right to no request current law
 
03:42:00.889 --> 03:42:00.899 align:start position:0%
prohibits ballots and and certain
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
materials from being seen by anybody
 
03:42:05.570 --> 03:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
other than those who show up at a
 
03:42:05.580 --> 03:42:06.710 align:start position:0%
other than those who show up at a
recount

03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
recount
 
03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
then through lots of recounts Dunbarton
 
03:42:10.790 --> 03:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
still hand counts their ballots so I see
 
03:42:12.410 --> 03:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
lots of ballots every election cycle as
 
03:42:15.070 --> 03:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
long as I'm not on the ballot
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is different than there's a there
 
03:42:19.370 --> 03:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
was a similar Bill heard by this
 
03:42:22.130 --> 03:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
committee recently relative to ballots
 
03:42:24.410 --> 03:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
being accessed this is slightly
 
03:42:25.729 --> 03:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
different and I'm going to highlight
 
03:42:31.969 --> 03:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:34.130 --> 03:42:34.140 align:start position:0%
a ballot
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
assuming it's an at some level is
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
anonymous right there's a bunch of
 
03:42:40.490 --> 03:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
checked boxes okay it doesn't
 
03:42:42.410 --> 03:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily describe who filled it out
 
03:42:44.450 --> 03:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
how it was filled out how they how the
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
person voted however canceled and uncast
 
03:42:47.460 --> 03:42:49.130 align:start position:0%
person voted however canceled and uncast
ballots

03:42:49.130 --> 03:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:42:51.530 --> 03:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
right rejected
 
03:42:53.450 --> 03:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
um absentee ballots a bunch of these
 
03:42:55.130 --> 03:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
actually have confidential information
 
03:42:57.650 --> 03:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
because there's a name somehow tied to
 
03:43:01.610 --> 03:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
this short list of of ballots right
 
03:43:03.769 --> 03:43:03.779 align:start position:0%
ballots that are in the box that have
 
03:43:08.090 --> 03:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
been cast that weren't challenged okay
 
03:43:11.690 --> 03:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
um are effectively Anonymous data
 
03:43:13.729 --> 03:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
that's different than the ones that I
 
03:43:15.769 --> 03:43:15.779 align:start position:0%
highlighted and left so I basically said
 
03:43:17.330 --> 03:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
make all the ones that are Anonymous
 
03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
data available to the public and the
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
benefit to this is
 
03:43:24.889 --> 03:43:24.899 align:start position:0%
um we already have machines that scan
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
these they do some work for calculating
 
03:43:31.370 --> 03:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
and and tabulating votes as well but
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
high speed scanners are readily
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
available technology is off the shelf
 
03:43:38.269 --> 03:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
and the benefit to scanning and
 
03:43:40.610 --> 03:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
Publishing the original data and making
 
03:43:42.769 --> 03:43:42.779 align:start position:0%
it available if someone comes in with a
 
03:43:44.450 --> 03:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
right to know request
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
is anybody can go verify that their
 
03:43:49.370 --> 03:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
ballot was counted they know what the
 
03:43:51.469 --> 03:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
pattern was they may have done check
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
marks all the way down and then one
 
03:43:54.769 --> 03:43:54.779 align:start position:0%
looked more like an X so they can look
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
through that file and say yep I see my
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
ballot was in there and when I added up
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
all the ones for my race or this other
 
03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
race that I was concerned about I see
 
03:44:07.969 --> 03:44:07.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's not hard to start thinking about
 
03:44:12.290 --> 03:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
storing this data long term anyway we
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
store a lot most of the world is moving
 
03:44:17.150 --> 03:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
to storing electronic files if we have
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
them in electronic files there's no
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
reason why the PDFs couldn't be
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
available under a simple right to know
 
03:44:22.560 --> 03:44:23.990 align:start position:0%
available under a simple right to know
request

03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:44:26.690 --> 03:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
I do think we have to pay attention to
 
03:44:28.550 --> 03:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
the list of ballots that I mentioned in
 
03:44:28.560 --> 03:44:31.150 align:start position:0%
the list of ballots that I mentioned in
21-25

03:44:31.150 --> 03:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
21-25
 
03:44:34.729 --> 03:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
because those are no longer
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
Anonymous level data
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
um you could actually try and figure out
 
03:44:43.130 --> 03:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
based on a absentee ballot that wasn't
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
turned in that arrives at the town
 
03:44:47.450 --> 03:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
clerk's office too late if that's
 
03:44:49.370 --> 03:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
available someone can open it up and
 
03:44:51.950 --> 03:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
know well so John Smith over here voted
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
this way because I saw his ballot and I
 
03:44:56.450 --> 03:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
saw it tied to the name I don't ever
 
03:44:57.889 --> 03:44:57.899 align:start position:0%
want to allow that to happen I don't
 
03:44:59.809 --> 03:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
ever want to I want to keep voting
 
03:45:04.870 --> 03:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:07.490 --> 03:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
so but there's no reason why we can't
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
see the rest of the the ballots and for
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
them for those who run the run the
 
03:45:13.010 --> 03:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
ballots through the machines already
 
03:45:15.229 --> 03:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
we're used to this being a stack of
 
03:45:18.050 --> 03:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
ballots we're used to those who go to
 
03:45:20.570 --> 03:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
recount seeing everybody's ballot
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
the only difference between those who
 
03:45:24.650 --> 03:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
request a recount and and the rest of
 
03:45:27.950 --> 03:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
the state in terms of ballot exposure is
 
03:45:30.410 --> 03:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
someone didn't ask for a recount if
 
03:45:32.330 --> 03:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
literally you could make a hundred
 
03:45:33.530 --> 03:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
percent of the ballots available
 
03:45:35.870 --> 03:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow without a right to know request
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's a next election by requesting a
 
03:45:41.450 --> 03:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
recount in every state rep race and the
 
03:45:42.950 --> 03:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
same thing would take place all that
 
03:45:47.090 --> 03:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:47.809 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:45:47.809 --> 03:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:49.969 --> 03:45:49.979 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's overly burnism I
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be moving in the
 
03:45:53.150 --> 03:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
direction long term of having some sort
 
03:45:55.250 --> 03:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
of machine that scans these anyway and
 
03:45:56.929 --> 03:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
at that point the PDF file is available
 
03:45:59.150 --> 03:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
and If the town clerk needs to release
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
the PDF file it's a it's literally email
 
03:46:04.490 --> 03:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
the PDF file out there's no reason why
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
we can't scan the ballots fully the
 
03:46:08.450 --> 03:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
night of the election and storm
 
03:46:08.460 --> 03:46:10.550 align:start position:0%
night of the election and storm
digitally

03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
digitally
 
03:46:13.490 --> 03:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
with that um
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'll close my testimony and answer any
 
03:46:17.630 --> 03:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any I am sure
 
03:46:18.889 --> 03:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
there will be questions questions from
 
03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:46:23.090 --> 03:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative weary
 
03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:46:27.170 --> 03:46:27.180 align:start position:0%
taking the time to answer the question
 
03:46:27.180 --> 03:46:29.389 align:start position:0%
taking the time to answer the question
um

03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:31.550 --> 03:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
so about I think half the towns do hand
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
cans now
 
03:46:38.450 --> 03:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
um what provision would you see for
 
03:46:41.630 --> 03:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh tabulating right using that word uh
 
03:46:46.490 --> 03:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
counting those uh hand count towns
 
03:46:50.090 --> 03:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
so so I believe there we have funds
 
03:46:52.130 --> 03:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
remaining in one of the federal grants
 
03:46:54.650 --> 03:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
for running elections and election
 
03:46:56.450 --> 03:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
Integrity there's no reason why we
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't provide to each of the towns a
 
03:47:01.490 --> 03:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanner capable of the town
 
03:47:04.010 --> 03:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
clerk scanning the file after the
 
03:47:06.170 --> 03:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
election and making right scan images
 
03:47:09.050 --> 03:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
available just like you would for any
 
03:47:10.490 --> 03:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
almost any other right to know request
 
03:47:12.290 --> 03:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
is is typically done electronically as
 
03:47:15.290 --> 03:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
opposed to physical paper copies
 
03:47:16.969 --> 03:47:16.979 align:start position:0%
take a follow-up
 
03:47:16.979 --> 03:47:18.889 align:start position:0%
take a follow-up
okay

03:47:18.889 --> 03:47:18.899 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:20.150 --> 03:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you and
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:47:24.359 --> 03:47:25.729 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

03:47:25.729 --> 03:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:27.590 --> 03:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
prior to drafting this bill or
 
03:47:29.570 --> 03:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
requesting this bill be drafted did you
 
03:47:32.330 --> 03:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
happen to consult with any Town clerks
 
03:47:32.340 --> 03:47:34.190 align:start position:0%
happen to consult with any Town clerks
about

03:47:34.190 --> 03:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:47:39.769 --> 03:47:39.779 align:start position:0%
um the ballot handling process or about
 
03:47:39.779 --> 03:47:40.370 align:start position:0%
um the ballot handling process or about
um

03:47:40.370 --> 03:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:44.690 --> 03:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
filling 91a requests and how that works
 
03:47:44.700 --> 03:47:45.910 align:start position:0%
filling 91a requests and how that works
through

03:47:45.910 --> 03:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
municipal offices
 
03:47:50.809 --> 03:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
I did talk about making the public I did
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
talk with several Town clerks and
 
03:47:55.250 --> 03:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist about
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
making the ballots public right that and
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
they agreed that that is the best
 
03:48:01.729 --> 03:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
insurance way to make sure that we have
 
03:48:05.210 --> 03:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
integrity in our elections
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
as an engineer right I always look at
 
03:48:09.170 --> 03:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
like looking at the original data and
 
03:48:11.210 --> 03:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
the best way to show that our system
 
03:48:16.190 --> 03:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
works is to publish the original data
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
um now in terms of the process on
 
03:48:19.729 --> 03:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
Election night where they collect all
 
03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
the ballots they put them in the boxes
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
they sealed the boxes up with the
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
special tape they sign and autograph
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
everything and then they go into some
 
03:48:28.429 --> 03:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
Vault you can't do it right you can't
 
03:48:30.710 --> 03:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
then necessarily go back the day after
 
03:48:33.410 --> 03:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
and open those boxes back up what you're
 
03:48:35.210 --> 03:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
going to want to do is scan the ballots
 
03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
on the way into the boxes so the images
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
are available
 
03:48:41.690 --> 03:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
follow up please yep
 
03:48:44.929 --> 03:48:44.939 align:start position:0%
are you aware that currently our
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
um ballot counting machines do not have
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
digital scanning and that the machines
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
that we are considering for the future
 
03:49:00.290 --> 03:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
purchase may have that capability but
 
03:49:02.809 --> 03:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that every
 
03:49:06.490 --> 03:49:06.500 align:start position:0%
municipality would have those machines
 
03:49:10.969 --> 03:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
or high-speed scanning machines
 
03:49:14.090 --> 03:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
for any purpose that would be able to
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
fulfill what is outlined in this bill
 
03:49:21.410 --> 03:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
so yes the current machines
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
are tabulating machines they are not
 
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
high speed scanning Right image storage
 
03:49:28.490 --> 03:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
devices I agree with you there future
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
machines will have that inherent
 
03:49:32.450 --> 03:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
Hardware that's how the machines will
 
03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
work and then they will use software to
 
03:49:36.229 --> 03:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
digitally figure out how the votes are
 
03:49:36.239 --> 03:49:37.429 align:start position:0%
digitally figure out how the votes are
tabulated

03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
tabulated
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
so it is possible in the future machines
 
03:49:42.769 --> 03:49:42.779 align:start position:0%
to have them just publish a copy of the
 
03:49:44.690 --> 03:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
image now I'm not sure what machines the
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is looking
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
at but high-speed scanning technology is
 
03:49:52.250 --> 03:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
readily available okay and depending on
 
03:49:54.530 --> 03:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
on the size and scope and cost of the
 
03:49:57.550 --> 03:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
machine it runs from hundreds of images
 
03:50:00.830 --> 03:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
per minute to thousands of images per
 
03:50:04.610 --> 03:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
minute these machines are very capable I
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to go buy a 500
 
03:50:08.330 --> 03:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
000 high-speed image scanner for every
 
03:50:10.370 --> 03:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
town but they do have machines that are
 
03:50:12.769 --> 03:50:12.779 align:start position:0%
set up to scan thousands of images in
 
03:50:15.290 --> 03:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.150 --> 03:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
I think what we would want to do is
 
03:50:19.610 --> 03:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
outfit outfit each town with one of
 
03:50:21.590 --> 03:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
these and as part of the process go
 
03:50:24.889 --> 03:50:24.899 align:start position:0%
ahead and before the the ballots go into
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
the box scan the whole thing and store
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:34.729 --> 03:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:36.650 --> 03:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
I don't see a fiscal note attached to
 
03:50:38.210 --> 03:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:50:43.550 --> 03:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
who and how are we paying for the
 
03:50:45.650 --> 03:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanning devices for every
 
03:50:49.250 --> 03:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
municipality and who is paying for the
 
03:50:52.210 --> 03:50:52.220 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
03:50:55.969 --> 03:50:55.979 align:start position:0%
the election workers time in scanning
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
all of this as well who's responsible
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
for those costs
 
03:51:00.950 --> 03:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:51:02.870 --> 03:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
um typically legislators don't craft the
 
03:51:05.450 --> 03:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
financial notes like various departments
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
is do that
 
03:51:07.800 --> 03:51:09.410 align:start position:0%
is do that
um

03:51:09.410 --> 03:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:11.570 --> 03:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure why this one doesn't
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note of any sort
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
we do I do believe there are still money
 
03:51:19.190 --> 03:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
retained or remaining in some of the
 
03:51:20.929 --> 03:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
federal grants under the Secretary of
 
03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
State for election Integrity that we
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
could use to cover the cost of Hardware
 
03:51:28.250 --> 03:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:30.050 --> 03:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up please please you
 
03:51:31.610 --> 03:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
know you know not the question you know
 
03:51:32.690 --> 03:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
not the statement you just paid
 
03:51:32.700 --> 03:51:34.750 align:start position:0%
not the statement you just paid
representative

03:51:34.750 --> 03:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
what follow-up this bill has an
 
03:51:40.130 --> 03:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
effective date 60 days after passage so
 
03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering where
 
03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
where are we coming up with the funding
 
03:51:47.570 --> 03:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
for these municipalities within those 60
 
03:51:50.050 --> 03:51:50.060 align:start position:0%
days after passage If This Were to
 
03:51:55.309 --> 03:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
succeed in every step along the way
 
03:51:59.150 --> 03:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
so am I correct that there was a pool of
 
03:52:01.190 --> 03:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
money for election integrity at one
 
03:52:01.200 --> 03:52:01.910 align:start position:0%
money for election integrity at one
point

03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:52:04.490 --> 03:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
this goes back at least two years ago
 
03:52:06.410 --> 03:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
maybe it's maybe it's been depleted but
 
03:52:07.610 --> 03:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
I thought there were several million
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
dollars set aside
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
for election Integrity related issues
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.550 --> 03:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
I I couldn't tell you that very much I
 
03:52:21.050 --> 03:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
just I pray to God not referring to have
 
03:52:22.250 --> 03:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
a funds because I just we just sat
 
03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
through that for a while so okay
 
03:52:27.710 --> 03:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and in reference to the 60 days right
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
the next election is quite a ways out
 
03:52:33.530 --> 03:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't likely to pass before
 
03:52:35.210 --> 03:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
um the midterm sorry the Municipal
 
03:52:37.490 --> 03:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
elections this fall so what we're
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
talking about is potentially City
 
03:52:44.090 --> 03:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
elections in November and or the
 
03:52:48.349 --> 03:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:49.309 --> 03:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
would you like a follow-up
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative like here look like the
 
03:52:53.330 --> 03:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
gears are turning
 
03:52:58.910 --> 03:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:01.250 --> 03:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
so this bill is based on the premise
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have new ballot
 
03:53:08.150 --> 03:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
counting machines prior to 2024 that is
 
03:53:11.090 --> 03:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.150 --> 03:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
some way shape or form
 
03:53:14.160 --> 03:53:16.729 align:start position:0%
some way shape or form
um

03:53:16.729 --> 03:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm just trying to wrap my
 
03:53:22.030 --> 03:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
head around this can you just explain
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
where the funding is coming from and how
 
03:53:28.849 --> 03:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
this could possibly
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
um be enacted 60 days after passage or
 
03:53:35.929 --> 03:53:35.939 align:start position:0%
by 2024. I believe the representative
 
03:53:38.570 --> 03:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
just spoke to the funding whether or not
 
03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
the answer was acceptable to you or not
 
03:53:43.729 --> 03:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
is is fine uh the the question about the
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
implementation speed is valid so I will
 
03:53:48.290 --> 03:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
allow that forward thank you
 
03:53:48.300 --> 03:53:51.590 align:start position:0%
allow that forward thank you
so

03:53:51.590 --> 03:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
because 60 days to implement this
 
03:53:56.150 --> 03:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that there's an election on
 
03:53:59.150 --> 03:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
day 61. the next elections that this
 
03:54:01.190 --> 03:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
would have to be in place for are either
 
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
the likely elections of November this
 
03:54:06.830 --> 03:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
year which is six months out or at least
 
03:54:08.809 --> 03:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
four months after the bill potentially
 
03:54:11.090 --> 03:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
could be signed into law assuming it's
 
03:54:13.910 --> 03:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the July time frame and then the
 
03:54:17.929 --> 03:54:17.939 align:start position:0%
subsequent elections in 2024.
 
03:54:20.269 --> 03:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
um high-speed scanning devices start
 
03:54:22.130 --> 03:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
about a thousand dollars and they work
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
up depending on the throughput you need
 
03:54:27.290 --> 03:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
um some of the ones are significantly
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
more expensive but you don't need
 
03:54:32.870 --> 03:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollar scanner for
 
03:54:35.450 --> 03:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
a town of a thousand people when you can
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
do it in 10 minutes using something that
 
03:54:37.859 --> 03:54:38.870 align:start position:0%
do it in 10 minutes using something that
does

03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:54:43.010 --> 03:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
whatever 20 50 pages a minute
 
03:54:46.130 --> 03:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
03:54:49.370 --> 03:54:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.750 --> 03:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.760 --> 03:54:54.950 align:start position:0%
 
Juju

03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
Juju
 
03:54:58.010 --> 03:54:58.020 align:start position:0%
who is going to pay for
 
03:54:59.929 --> 03:54:59.939 align:start position:0%
the staff
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the time
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
that staff is going to take
 
03:55:08.870 --> 03:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
for all of these 91a requests that will
 
03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:16.010 --> 03:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
so if the ballots are available and are
 
03:55:17.510 --> 03:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
ready scanned I'm going to answer this
 
03:55:19.849 --> 03:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
in two parts right on Election night
 
03:55:22.309 --> 03:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
prior to the ballots being put into the
 
03:55:25.130 --> 03:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
boxes and sealed and stored if that if
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
those documents are scanned ahead of
 
03:55:27.720 --> 03:55:28.550 align:start position:0%
those documents are scanned ahead of
time

03:55:28.550 --> 03:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:55:32.210 --> 03:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
the 91 91a request is relatively simple
 
03:55:34.849 --> 03:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
it's send them a copy of the file this
 
03:55:37.370 --> 03:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
is not a difficult task or a significant
 
03:55:39.469 --> 03:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of what takes place that night
 
03:55:44.689 --> 03:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
currently Town clerks spend a lot of
 
03:55:47.330 --> 03:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
time especially in hand counted talents
 
03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
double checking their math making sure
 
03:55:53.210 --> 03:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
that the overvotes the undervotes all
 
03:55:55.729 --> 03:55:55.739 align:start position:0%
the list goes on you guys are much more
 
03:55:57.950 --> 03:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
aware of it than I am
 
03:56:00.410 --> 03:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
all of those boxes are checked and all
 
03:56:02.150 --> 03:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
of those things are tabulated I've sat
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
at tables with another person right in
 
03:56:07.550 --> 03:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton every election cycle counting
 
03:56:07.560 --> 03:56:09.650 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton every election cycle counting
ballots

03:56:09.650 --> 03:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
03:56:13.429 --> 03:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
if long term you could do the the effort
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
of scanning these and and allowing them
 
03:56:18.290 --> 03:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
to be under a 91a we could start to cut
 
03:56:20.570 --> 03:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
back on some of those those additional
 
03:56:22.189 --> 03:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
requests we've made of the Town clerks
 
03:56:24.170 --> 03:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
make it even easier to get the counting
 
03:56:26.269 --> 03:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
done right they do the counting they
 
03:56:28.610 --> 03:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
count all the offices they scan them and
 
03:56:30.110 --> 03:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
they they release them and then if
 
03:56:31.969 --> 03:56:31.979 align:start position:0%
someone wants to go look to see whether
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
there was a bunch of undervotes or
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
overvotes or all the other things that
 
03:56:37.010 --> 03:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
we look for
 
03:56:38.450 --> 03:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
um they could do that on their own time
 
03:56:42.290 --> 03:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:43.969 --> 03:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
further questions from the community
 
03:56:43.979 --> 03:56:46.130 align:start position:0%
further questions from the community
representative

03:56:46.130 --> 03:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative hole for taking my
 
03:56:49.319 --> 03:56:50.689 align:start position:0%
representative hole for taking my
question

03:56:50.689 --> 03:56:50.699 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
I'm been reading line 17 through 21 on
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
page one
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
a question relates to those lines those
 
03:57:01.689 --> 03:57:01.699 align:start position:0%
two sentences there the first reads
 
03:57:04.189 --> 03:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
ballots shall not be exempt from the
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
provisions of RS 91a that's
 
03:57:09.410 --> 03:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
understandable yep next sentence
 
03:57:11.809 --> 03:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
uh beginning in the last quarter of line
 
03:57:16.370 --> 03:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
19 says this exemption this exemption
 
03:57:19.610 --> 03:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
shall apply to any ballots or absentee
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
voter affidavits
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh maybe I'm reading this wrong but it
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
seems that this exemption shall apply to
 
03:57:29.929 --> 03:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
any ballots how does it not contradict
 
03:57:33.490 --> 03:57:33.500 align:start position:0%
the first sentence starting on line 17.
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
so I think the exemption and goes to
 
03:57:38.460 --> 03:57:39.769 align:start position:0%
so I think the exemption and goes to
um

03:57:39.769 --> 03:57:39.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:44.330 --> 03:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
where is it there was a section in
 
03:57:46.490 --> 03:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
there was a section in law about them
 
03:57:49.790 --> 03:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
right about 91a and I think it's a
 
03:57:53.030 --> 03:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
different section of law relative to
 
03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
what is allowed under 91a and not and
 
03:57:57.769 --> 03:57:57.779 align:start position:0%
ballots are Exempted under that section
 
03:58:00.370 --> 03:58:00.380 align:start position:0%
right so this was an exemption statute
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
right but the first sentence yes I'm
 
03:58:11.389 --> 03:58:11.399 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chairman follow up please
 
03:58:12.969 --> 03:58:12.979 align:start position:0%
all right but
 
03:58:15.769 --> 03:58:15.779 align:start position:0%
uh the first sentence says ballot shall
 
03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
not be exempt from the provisions of 91a
 
03:58:20.330 --> 03:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
and the next sentence says this
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
exemption this exemption shall apply to
 
03:58:24.650 --> 03:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
any ballots oh I see what you're saying
 
03:58:27.410 --> 03:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
the any ballots comment yeah a fair
 
03:58:29.450 --> 03:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
point that might be a drafting thing
 
03:58:31.729 --> 03:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
that came out of OLS we were trying to
 
03:58:34.010 --> 03:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
deal with canceled and uncast ballots
 
03:58:37.189 --> 03:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
right versus the generic ballots
 
03:58:39.590 --> 03:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:58:41.150 --> 03:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
um I can take one more I have a two
 
03:58:42.889 --> 03:58:42.899 align:start position:0%
o'clock all right hey look at that all
 
03:58:45.050 --> 03:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
right uh you may not even get one more
 
03:58:47.330 --> 03:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
or any further oh yep rips the mirror
 
03:58:49.010 --> 03:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
it's not gonna let you out of there I'm
 
03:58:50.150 --> 03:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
gonna defer to burn all right
 
03:58:50.160 --> 03:58:52.250 align:start position:0%
gonna defer to burn all right
representative

03:58:52.250 --> 03:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:58:54.830 --> 03:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
03:59:00.650 --> 03:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:04.250 --> 03:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm in this bill it is not in this bill
 
03:59:07.849 --> 03:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
right it is the easiest way to deal with
 
03:59:09.710 --> 03:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
making the balance available instead of
 
03:59:09.720 --> 03:59:10.910 align:start position:0%
making the balance available instead of
handing

03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
handing
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
um someone who comes into the town
 
03:59:14.689 --> 03:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
office the stack of sealed boxes what
 
03:59:17.090 --> 03:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
you do is you scan them on the way into
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
the skilled boxes and then those images
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
are available later on for a 91a
 
03:59:25.130 --> 03:59:25.140 align:start position:0%
up please uh does it we have time for
 
03:59:27.050 --> 03:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
follow yeah yes it's just reliability to
 
03:59:29.389 --> 03:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
the same thing so really this is really
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
determining on the equipment at the time
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
of Elections is that correct it is
 
03:59:37.130 --> 03:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
determined upon that you would you to do
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
you could implement this now right and
 
03:59:42.349 --> 03:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
if you saw an abundance of people asking
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
for requests for 91a buy the next
 
03:59:45.950 --> 03:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
election cycle you would want to make
 
03:59:47.330 --> 03:59:47.340 align:start position:0%
sure the machines are in place to do
 
03:59:47.340 --> 03:59:48.110 align:start position:0%
sure the machines are in place to do
this

03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:59:50.150 --> 03:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you all right is that it for you
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative we'll bring the
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
HMA back up so we can keep going
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
grilling on him and move on May I have
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
one comment it's your testimony so yeah
 
04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
uh notwithstanding any prior testimony
 
04:00:06.769 --> 04:00:06.779 align:start position:0%
that I may have given today uh I would
 
04:00:10.370 --> 04:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
not support any effort to uh use Hava
 
04:00:13.490 --> 04:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
funds to to purchase high-speed scanners
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of scanning devices
 
04:00:17.530 --> 04:00:17.540 align:start position:0%
because I don't see how that helps
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
anyone vote
 
04:00:23.929 --> 04:00:23.939 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions okay are there
 
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee uh I I
 
04:00:28.070 --> 04:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably I will have some so if someone
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
wants to get in before I do go for it
 
04:00:31.439 --> 04:00:32.269 align:start position:0%
wants to get in before I do go for it
um

04:00:32.269 --> 04:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:36.590 --> 04:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
so your testimony that was interrupted
 
04:00:36.600 --> 04:00:37.370 align:start position:0%
so your testimony that was interrupted
um

04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:39.769 --> 04:00:39.779 align:start position:0%
uh concern was I just want to kind of
 
04:00:41.689 --> 04:00:41.699 align:start position:0%
recap the municipal association's
 
04:00:45.410 --> 04:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
concerns so you have concerns about
 
04:00:45.420 --> 04:00:46.309 align:start position:0%
concerns so you have concerns about
um

04:00:46.309 --> 04:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:48.830 --> 04:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
the cost or who's going to pay for the
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
staff time or the scanner or whatever so
 
04:00:53.150 --> 04:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
you've cost about that
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and then you had
 
04:00:58.429 --> 04:00:58.439 align:start position:0%
um you had one other question I'm asking
 
04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
my own follow-up here but you another
 
04:01:02.929 --> 04:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
concern about the potential of tampering
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
potential tampering of balance but if
 
04:01:06.590 --> 04:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's after the election has been
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
certified and all the legal challenges
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
are done
 
04:01:15.170 --> 04:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question uh I I would
 
04:01:21.950 --> 04:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:01:25.250 --> 04:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we are
 
04:01:26.929 --> 04:01:26.939 align:start position:0%
keeping the ballots
 
04:01:29.450 --> 04:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
or the period specified in in the
 
04:01:32.510 --> 04:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
statute and then disposing them as such
 
04:01:35.210 --> 04:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
or the purpose of whether they need to
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
be recounted or whether further action
 
04:01:38.689 --> 04:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken and that's why we're
 
04:01:41.950 --> 04:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
preserving them in the sealed containers
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I think we would care
 
04:01:47.330 --> 04:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
about them
 
04:01:47.340 --> 04:01:48.650 align:start position:0%
about them
okay

04:01:48.650 --> 04:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:48.660 --> 04:01:49.370 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:01:49.370 --> 04:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
so you're you're saying that we care
 
04:01:52.490 --> 04:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
about them because the federal
 
04:01:53.929 --> 04:01:53.939 align:start position:0%
government requires us to keep for 22
 
04:01:55.250 --> 04:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
months so that's why we care about them
 
04:01:57.530 --> 04:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
04:01:59.990 --> 04:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
um so my last question is so let's say
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
the the money
 
04:02:04.729 --> 04:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
question disappears and
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
um the it's after the election so
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
nothing can change even if they find the
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
most horrendous counting known to man
 
04:02:13.790 --> 04:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
at that point does the association have
 
04:02:15.590 --> 04:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
any concerns if those two things are
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
alleviated we find a magical way that
 
04:02:19.729 --> 04:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
the magical Money Tree pays for
 
04:02:19.739 --> 04:02:21.229 align:start position:0%
the magical Money Tree pays for
everything

04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:02:24.110 --> 04:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and the and the elections cannot be
 
04:02:25.729 --> 04:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
changed what are the concerns does the
 
04:02:27.170 --> 04:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
municipal Association have at that point
 
04:02:29.389 --> 04:02:29.399 align:start position:0%
well if the magical Money Tree is paying
 
04:02:32.570 --> 04:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
for all the staff time is paying for uh
 
04:02:35.210 --> 04:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
you know the scanning or whatever copy
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
needs to occur and on that point I just
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
want to add that um the uh New Hampshire
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has ruled in a couple
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
cases uh Taylor versus SAU 55 and green
 
04:02:47.210 --> 04:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
versus SAU 55 and those are from around
 
04:02:47.220 --> 04:02:49.429 align:start position:0%
versus SAU 55 and those are from around
2017

04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
2017
 
04:02:51.530 --> 04:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
um that electronic records are the ones
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
that have to be reduced electronically
 
04:02:55.010 --> 04:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
everything else is you know paper
 
04:02:57.170 --> 04:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
records are produced paper copies
 
04:02:58.729 --> 04:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't have to be
 
04:03:00.650 --> 04:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
scanned and emailed
 
04:03:03.530 --> 04:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
um so you know but if they're the
 
04:03:05.090 --> 04:03:05.100 align:start position:0%
magical money tree has paid for
 
04:03:05.100 --> 04:03:06.229 align:start position:0%
magical money tree has paid for
everything

04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
um then we're not really concerned
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
because it's paying for the costs of all
 
04:03:12.650 --> 04:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
of this production and all of this this
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh this effort going into it
 
04:03:15.720 --> 04:03:16.429 align:start position:0%
uh this effort going into it
um

04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's that really covers the scope of
 
04:03:22.250 --> 04:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
our production uh concerns okay I think
 
04:03:24.130 --> 04:03:24.140 align:start position:0%
that that was the only question
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
my stutter's kicking in representative
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you thank you for taking
 
04:03:30.290 --> 04:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
um in Reading 91a there are Provisions
 
04:03:36.769 --> 04:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
Beyond copying that a person might be
 
04:03:38.150 --> 04:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
access a requested document including
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
photographing or videoing
 
04:03:49.309 --> 04:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
um with technology being what it is now
 
04:03:51.710 --> 04:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
does the municipal Association have any
 
04:03:54.410 --> 04:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
concerns about the Integrity
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
um of our ballots
 
04:04:01.070 --> 04:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
given that anyone with an iPhone could
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
take a picture of however many ballots
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
and manipulate that with
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
a free easy to use
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know photo app
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions about the
 
04:04:16.849 --> 04:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
trust in our elections or the Integrity
 
04:04:19.010 --> 04:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
of our ballots with that potential for
 
04:04:19.020 --> 04:04:20.809 align:start position:0%
of our ballots with that potential for
manipulation

04:04:20.809 --> 04:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
manipulation
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
so we really have policies relating to
 
04:04:26.330 --> 04:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
the process and those all go towards
 
04:04:29.090 --> 04:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the election occur goes
 
04:04:31.750 --> 04:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
smoothly and the count is accurate
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
and that builds into the election
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
Integrity what I think the secretary of
 
04:04:37.370 --> 04:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
state would be better positioned to
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
answer your question thank you fair
 
04:04:42.050 --> 04:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
enough are any uh representative wood
 
04:04:43.790 --> 04:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:04:48.110 --> 04:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
um if we if we looked at phasing this in
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
as we get the new equipment it seems to
 
04:04:52.250 --> 04:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
me that we're going to have this digital
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
record we're going to have this argument
 
04:04:56.809 --> 04:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
coming down the line that data sitting
 
04:04:58.729 --> 04:04:58.739 align:start position:0%
around for 22 months nobody looking at
 
04:05:03.170 --> 04:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
is is not not what I I Envision going
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
forward if we phase this in if this had
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
a a amendment to phase it in so that
 
04:05:10.849 --> 04:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
would basically talking about data that
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
comes from the free from these machines
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
some management would that be would that
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
have the same concern I understand you
 
04:05:20.410 --> 04:05:20.420 align:start position:0%
can what your concerned you said before
 
04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
so are there a couple things that I want
 
04:05:25.429 --> 04:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
to raise that I I don't know the answer
 
04:05:25.439 --> 04:05:26.630 align:start position:0%
to raise that I I don't know the answer
to

04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:05:29.330 --> 04:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
um first I have no idea what the new
 
04:05:31.010 --> 04:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
machines are capable of what
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
capabilities they are I'm sure the
 
04:05:34.370 --> 04:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State could could answer
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
those questions for you with the
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
different vendors
 
04:05:39.550 --> 04:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
you know as far as having essentially a
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
data file a basically a a long PDF with
 
04:05:48.410 --> 04:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
different ballots on on each
 
04:05:48.420 --> 04:05:49.070 align:start position:0%
different ballots on on each
um

04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
a different ballot on each page
 
04:05:54.889 --> 04:05:54.899 align:start position:0%
um you're only going to have that
 
04:05:57.889 --> 04:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
four machine counted ballots you're not
 
04:06:00.429 --> 04:06:00.439 align:start position:0%
going to have that in the 113
 
04:06:02.750 --> 04:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
locations where their hand counts you're
 
04:06:04.689 --> 04:06:04.699 align:start position:0%
not going to have that for any of the
 
04:06:06.830 --> 04:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
affidavit ballots that occur where
 
04:06:08.150 --> 04:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
someone comes and registers for the
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
first time without any paperwork and
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
they have to put their battle in the
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
side pocket
 
04:06:15.290 --> 04:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
so you will you may end up with the
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
perception of saying hey we've you know
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
who's conquered this example because we
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
use machines here
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
um we you know they release uh these a
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
PDF for each Ward and someone goes
 
04:06:31.010 --> 04:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
through and adds those up but that's not
 
04:06:33.050 --> 04:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
going to be the total number of ballots
 
04:06:35.750 --> 04:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
that are actually counted because you
 
04:06:37.250 --> 04:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
have a whole bunch that went in the side
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
pocket that were hand counted that were
 
04:06:40.250 --> 04:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
tabulated in as part of the the
 
04:06:42.650 --> 04:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
paperwork that sent to the Secretary of
 
04:06:44.090 --> 04:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
State's office that's part of the vote
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
count so you do risk the possibility of
 
04:06:51.769 --> 04:06:51.779 align:start position:0%
having not captured every ballot and
 
04:06:51.779 --> 04:06:52.610 align:start position:0%
having not captured every ballot and
that

04:06:52.610 --> 04:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:06:56.269 --> 04:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
May impinge upon people's belief about
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh whether the the count was valid or
 
04:06:58.560 --> 04:07:00.170 align:start position:0%
uh whether the the count was valid or
not

04:07:00.170 --> 04:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:07:01.849 --> 04:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
04:07:05.090 --> 04:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you now we will
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
take deputy secretary Hennessey
 
04:07:08.760 --> 04:07:17.630 align:start position:0%
take deputy secretary Hennessey
foreign

04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Aaron Hennessey
 
04:07:22.010 --> 04:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state and although I
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
really appreciate a representative Woods
 
04:07:25.250 --> 04:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill I'm glad to
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
have heard from the sponsor to get an
 
04:07:29.630 --> 04:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of what he was aiming
 
04:07:31.490 --> 04:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
towards so
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
um last week this committee heard house
 
04:07:34.080 --> 04:07:35.469 align:start position:0%
um last week this committee heard house
bill

04:07:35.469 --> 04:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
415 which pointing out again didn't have
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
an FN but should have
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
um and and I testified for a significant
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
amount of time on that one and um and I
 
04:07:48.170 --> 04:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
apologize I should have said we are in
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to the we are opposed to this
 
04:07:49.800 --> 04:07:50.990 align:start position:0%
opposed to the we are opposed to this
bill

04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:07:53.210 --> 04:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to do the same today and I
 
04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
apologize for shifting around but I
 
04:07:57.110 --> 04:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
think I want to first start out
 
04:08:00.050 --> 04:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
at the language of the bill I know this
 
04:08:02.570 --> 04:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
committee likes to look at the words and
 
04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
what they mean and how they're
 
04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
structured and we did this earlier today
 
04:08:05.760 --> 04:08:07.309 align:start position:0%
structured and we did this earlier today
but

04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:10.010 --> 04:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
um to represent quaily's point
 
04:08:14.769 --> 04:08:14.779 align:start position:0%
when you look at the language on lines
 
04:08:18.410 --> 04:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
1920 actually that whole paragraph it
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
says ballots shall not be exempt from
 
04:08:23.269 --> 04:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
the provisions of RSA 91a
 
04:08:26.210 --> 04:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
and then it refers to the exemption
 
04:08:29.570 --> 04:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm not quite sure there does appear
 
04:08:31.670 --> 04:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
to be some sort of drafting era but in
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
that same
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
next um sentence there it says the
 
04:08:38.330 --> 04:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
exemption shall apply to any ballots or
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
absentee voter affidavits prepared for
 
04:08:46.370 --> 04:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
or used in an election conducted by the
 
04:08:49.490 --> 04:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
state or any political subdivision
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
including Federal elections so prepared
 
04:08:56.030 --> 04:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
for or used in is all election materials
 
04:08:59.210 --> 04:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
so it's all um it's all ballots that
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
were not actually used so those have
 
04:09:03.410 --> 04:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
been prepared for an election and the
 
04:09:05.330 --> 04:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
ones used in were the ones that someone
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
cast a ballot on or spoiled or anything
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:09:11.689 --> 04:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
um and then the rest of that sentence
 
04:09:13.849 --> 04:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
says that it applies to State elections
 
04:09:15.170 --> 04:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
Federal elections and your local
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
municipality Municipal elections and
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
then the next new sentence canceled and
 
04:09:23.809 --> 04:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
uncast ballots and successfully
 
04:09:25.570 --> 04:09:25.580 align:start position:0%
challenged and rejected
 
04:09:27.650 --> 04:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
04:09:29.330 --> 04:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
still contained in their envelopes
 
04:09:32.090 --> 04:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
repaired blah blah shall be exempt from
 
04:09:35.450 --> 04:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a so then it says canceled and on
 
04:09:38.809 --> 04:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
cast ballots are exempt from 91a but it
 
04:09:41.630 --> 04:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't refer back to affidavits or any
 
04:09:43.729 --> 04:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
of the other envelopes or any of the
 
04:09:46.729 --> 04:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
other election materials prepared for an
 
04:09:46.739 --> 04:09:47.630 align:start position:0%
other election materials prepared for an
election

04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:09:50.330 --> 04:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
so going back to the last bill last week
 
04:09:53.150 --> 04:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
HP 415 where I testified that there's
 
04:09:55.729 --> 04:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
outer envelopes there's innum envelopes
 
04:09:58.010 --> 04:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
there's AF there's the mailing envelopes
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
there's the affidavit envelopes or
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
somebody has to sign
 
04:10:04.010 --> 04:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
my reading of this is those materials
 
04:10:05.570 --> 04:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
would have to be scanned as well if
 
04:10:08.389 --> 04:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to have an have a right
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
to know request but then getting to a
 
04:10:12.410 --> 04:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
lot of your questions about the scanning
 
04:10:15.290 --> 04:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
part of this bill nothing in this bill
 
04:10:17.689 --> 04:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
mentions a scanner nothing mentions the
 
04:10:20.090 --> 04:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
option of an electronic record if an
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
electronic record is available under 91a
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
then you can give them that information
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
electronically but if it's not available
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
then you have to make the paper those
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
paper ballots
 
04:10:30.960 --> 04:10:33.650 align:start position:0%
paper ballots
available

04:10:33.650 --> 04:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
you turn over to the next page
 
04:10:39.650 --> 04:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
it talks about how a clerk has to store
 
04:10:41.950 --> 04:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
the ballots and last year this committee
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
and the senate committee
 
04:10:47.689 --> 04:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
and the full legislative bodies agreed
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
that our ballots should be stored and
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
there should be a log kept it should be
 
04:10:54.889 --> 04:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
stored in a locked area whether a filing
 
04:10:56.570 --> 04:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
cabinet or wherever it however the
 
04:10:58.130 --> 04:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
municipality decides but needs to be
 
04:10:59.689 --> 04:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
locked and there needs to be a log kept
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
of who goes in and out
 
04:11:05.929 --> 04:11:05.939 align:start position:0%
so the the language in this bill allows
 
04:11:05.939 --> 04:11:07.969 align:start position:0%
so the the language in this bill allows
for

04:11:07.969 --> 04:11:07.979 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:11:07.979 --> 04:11:09.769 align:start position:0%
for
um someone

04:11:09.769 --> 04:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
um someone
 
04:11:13.250 --> 04:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
um to access that locked location
 
04:11:15.650 --> 04:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
so um it's talking about the ballots so
 
04:11:17.689 --> 04:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
once stored the containers shall be
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
accessible only to individuals working
 
04:11:22.670 --> 04:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
under the direct direction of the town
 
04:11:25.969 --> 04:11:25.979 align:start position:0%
clerk as required for recounts by a
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
person filing a right to no request
 
04:11:30.830 --> 04:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
under 91a or is necessary for the
 
04:11:32.809 --> 04:11:32.819 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to verify the store
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
the container storage so this language
 
04:11:37.610 --> 04:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
in here has nothing to do with scanning
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
as we heard a lot of testimony about it
 
04:11:41.929 --> 04:11:41.939 align:start position:0%
someone who files a right to know
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
request the way this is written can go
 
04:11:47.450 --> 04:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
into that Lock storage area and look at
 
04:11:49.610 --> 04:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
the balance that's what access this this
 
04:11:51.170 --> 04:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
bill gives them
 
04:11:53.630 --> 04:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
so that was my testimony about the
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
language of the bill where there's
 
04:11:57.769 --> 04:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and and again now no
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
mention of scanning
 
04:11:59.760 --> 04:12:01.790 align:start position:0%
mention of scanning
um

04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:03.590 --> 04:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
so now I'm going to just chit chat about
 
04:12:06.530 --> 04:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
why we don't like the building otherwise
 
04:12:09.650 --> 04:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
so other than all the conflicting
 
04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
language there's the time constraints
 
04:12:15.650 --> 04:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
mentioned by representative Brennan this
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
04:12:19.130 --> 04:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in the language of
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
this bill that says this applies to only
 
04:12:24.170 --> 04:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
future elections so 60 days after this
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill were to be signed into law someone
 
04:12:29.150 --> 04:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
can go into any of your town or city
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
clerk's offices and again I would
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
recommend reaching out to them to get
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
their opinion on this bill and they
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
would have to grant them access to their
 
04:12:39.170 --> 04:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
locked storage container where they've
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
kept their 2022 ballots
 
04:12:42.479 --> 04:12:44.469 align:start position:0%
kept their 2022 ballots
um

04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
and uh it wouldn't apply to this
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections in March but
 
04:12:50.929 --> 04:12:50.939 align:start position:0%
depending on when you have your
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
Minnesota elections it could apply to
 
04:12:55.130 --> 04:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
those as well
 
04:12:55.140 --> 04:12:55.790 align:start position:0%
those as well
um

04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:58.250 --> 04:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
so again the ballots are not currently
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
scanned nor all the election other other
 
04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
election materials scanned so you would
 
04:13:05.929 --> 04:13:05.939 align:start position:0%
give this person and anyone perhaps from
 
04:13:07.849 --> 04:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
out of state access to your physical
 
04:13:07.859 --> 04:13:09.290 align:start position:0%
out of state access to your physical
ballots

04:13:09.290 --> 04:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
just imagine a amount of time that it
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
will take for your local election
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
officials but also for the state to if
 
04:13:17.150 --> 04:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
we have any boxes that we've done
 
04:13:19.130 --> 04:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
recounts on and just a reminder we had a
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
record recount period and for our
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
November elections
 
04:13:23.399 --> 04:13:25.610 align:start position:0%
November elections
um

04:13:25.610 --> 04:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
the the law doesn't consider any of the
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
other laws that would need to be changed
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
related to changing of this and that if
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
you I don't know
 
04:13:37.130 --> 04:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
um who requested it but there's a good
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
memo over here on the table written by
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
your committee researcher and it goes
 
04:13:44.689 --> 04:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
into affidavits and other Natures of the
 
04:13:48.110 --> 04:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
91 a laws but anything related to access
 
04:13:50.030 --> 04:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
of ballots anything related to
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
affidavits personal information those
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
laws would have to be changed as well
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
um in um
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
some testimony related to that this bill
 
04:14:03.650 --> 04:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
was so that people can have confidence
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
in our elections but to representative
 
04:14:09.050 --> 04:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
Woods question and the municipal
 
04:14:12.530 --> 04:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
associations testimony
 
04:14:12.540 --> 04:14:13.790 align:start position:0%
associations testimony
um

04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
not every ballot is going to be scanned
 
04:14:17.870 --> 04:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
by our new scanners when we get them
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
there's going to be the hand count
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
balance there's going to be all the
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
other information that needs to be
 
04:14:24.050 --> 04:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
scanned so there's if anything this
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
might cause more questions to come up
 
04:14:28.969 --> 04:14:28.979 align:start position:0%
um if somebody's trying to recalculate
 
04:14:30.830 --> 04:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
an election to see if that really the
 
04:14:32.929 --> 04:14:32.939 align:start position:0%
results really were how
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
um your town or your ward said they were
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
or if have the recount ended up there's
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
going to be ballots that once we do have
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
our new devices that are not scanned so
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
there's going to be questions that come
 
04:14:44.530 --> 04:14:44.540 align:start position:0%
up from that
 
04:14:48.530 --> 04:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
at our last hearing related to 415
 
04:14:49.969 --> 04:14:49.979 align:start position:0%
somebody asked me to look into the
 
04:14:52.250 --> 04:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
Vermont law I did reach out to Vermont I
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back on what their access
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
to balance is but looking just my
 
04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
Googling and again it's
 
04:15:02.570 --> 04:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
not necessarily actual law but
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
um they do provide access to ballots but
 
04:15:07.729 --> 04:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
it's after the from what I can read and
 
04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
I'm still waiting for their legal
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
opinion it's after the public storage
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
information time frame has ended so
 
04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
nobody can make any changes accidentally
 
04:15:19.849 --> 04:15:19.859 align:start position:0%
or on purpose to the physical ballots
 
04:15:22.610 --> 04:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
during the recount time frame or to the
 
04:15:25.130 --> 04:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
22-month time frame again I'm trying to
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm still waiting to hear back from them
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh jumping around again I'm sorry the
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
history of the 2013 law change
 
04:15:38.150 --> 04:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
um that put ballots in the 91a exemption
 
04:15:38.160 --> 04:15:39.710 align:start position:0%
um that put ballots in the 91a exemption
category

04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
category
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
um for my discussions with secretary
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
Scanlon who was in had just started in
 
04:15:46.490 --> 04:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
my position that time but was previously
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the legislature that had to
 
04:15:52.010 --> 04:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
um pass bills related to help America
 
04:15:55.370 --> 04:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
vote act um ballots were although they
 
04:15:58.130 --> 04:15:58.140 align:start position:0%
were not exempt from 91a previously
 
04:16:00.050 --> 04:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
they were not ever open to the public
 
04:16:01.969 --> 04:16:01.979 align:start position:0%
they were not public access documents
 
04:16:04.370 --> 04:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
before so this
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
um putting them in as an exemption to
 
04:16:09.110 --> 04:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
91ma make sure that they wouldn't have
 
04:16:11.330 --> 04:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
Public Access so even though the law
 
04:16:13.250 --> 04:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
went into effect at that time frame it
 
04:16:14.809 --> 04:16:14.819 align:start position:0%
didn't actually change any of the
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
policies in New Hampshire
 
04:16:17.520 --> 04:16:24.729 align:start position:0%
policies in New Hampshire
um

04:16:24.729 --> 04:16:24.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.110 --> 04:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
I just want to reiterate that any of my
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that I said for the reasons we
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
were opposed to 415 applies to this bill
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
too and I'm happy to take questions okay
 
04:16:37.849 --> 04:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative Bruno Brian thank you Mr
 
04:16:40.560 --> 04:16:42.410 align:start position:0%
representative Bruno Brian thank you Mr
chairman

04:16:42.410 --> 04:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
as this is written I think you you
 
04:16:47.229 --> 04:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's nothing in here about
 
04:16:50.150 --> 04:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
creating an image
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
would this mean that some communities
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
would interpret this to mean they don't
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
need to create an image some would think
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
they should and then there would be an
 
04:17:01.680 --> 04:17:03.170 align:start position:0%
they should and then there would be an
in

04:17:03.170 --> 04:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
the things would be n equal if you were
 
04:17:07.490 --> 04:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
one person one town was trying to get
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
information they wouldn't
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
they'd find it differently and
 
04:17:14.210 --> 04:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
that that could be thank you thank you
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
for the question so
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
um this the same and again I'm not a
 
04:17:19.319 --> 04:17:20.389 align:start position:0%
um this the same and again I'm not a
lawyer

04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure there's somebody here though
 
04:17:22.969 --> 04:17:22.979 align:start position:0%
that is but
 
04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
um this is 91a does not require you to
 
04:17:29.090 --> 04:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
create a an electronic image of
 
04:17:30.530 --> 04:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
something but if you have it already
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
then you are supposed to give that if
 
04:17:35.689 --> 04:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
that's the way they requested the the
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
um the information so if a town does not
 
04:17:40.610 --> 04:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
have a ballot scanner or a high speed
 
04:17:43.010 --> 04:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
scanner of any sort they are not going
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide an electronic
 
04:17:46.729 --> 04:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
image somebody that does have one has
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
the option of running their ballots
 
04:17:50.269 --> 04:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
through according
 
04:17:52.729 --> 04:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
to the testimony we heard previously not
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
according to the language of the bill
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
um so there would be inconsistency on
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
how the information is given out if
 
04:18:03.769 --> 04:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
somebody requested 91a from every single
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
um municipality in the state for ballots
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
uh I do a follow-up representative yes
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
I'd like a follow-up thank you Mr
 
04:18:14.399 --> 04:18:16.490 align:start position:0%
I'd like a follow-up thank you Mr
chairman

04:18:16.490 --> 04:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
uh I also did a little math so if every
 
04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
community in the state
 
04:18:26.150 --> 04:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
asked for uh help obtaining financial
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
help obtaining these scanners
 
04:18:32.570 --> 04:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
would that fall under help America vote
 
04:18:35.809 --> 04:18:35.819 align:start position:0%
act funding and that'd be appropriate
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
use of those funds for three hundred and
 
04:18:42.889 --> 04:18:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:18:44.880 --> 04:18:45.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
I would have to look into that I I know
 
04:18:50.330 --> 04:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
that if you were to use a ballot
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
counting device that it would but I
 
04:18:53.950 --> 04:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
don't know that if you were to purchase
 
04:18:56.330 --> 04:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
scanning equipment for the purpose of
 
04:18:58.010 --> 04:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
91a that it would
 
04:19:01.809 --> 04:19:01.819 align:start position:0%
but I will get that information to you
 
04:19:04.189 --> 04:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Byrne
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
do you have a question yes thank you Mr
 
04:19:07.969 --> 04:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
question so ballots obviously come in
 
04:19:11.929 --> 04:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
various sizes
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
um we've talked about this before with
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
another bill as far as page sizes so
 
04:19:20.929 --> 04:19:20.939 align:start position:0%
that um costs would also be involved in
 
04:19:24.290 --> 04:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
the 91a on these ballots as well as the
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
time now usually what I understand is
 
04:19:28.849 --> 04:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
the 91a is paid for by the person
 
04:19:35.650 --> 04:19:35.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.170 --> 04:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
no the chairman is shaking his head um
 
04:19:41.689 --> 04:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
if you were to if you were to ask anyone
 
04:19:44.450 --> 04:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
who has respond in my opinion
 
04:19:46.790 --> 04:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
if you were to ask anyone that is has to
 
04:19:49.729 --> 04:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
respond to a 91a request there are
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
limitations on the charges that they can
 
04:19:54.889 --> 04:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
charge for a response to a 91a request
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
and that those limitations
 
04:20:00.650 --> 04:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
do not cover the cost
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
of a lot of requests
 
04:20:07.130 --> 04:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes so this is just
 
04:20:09.050 --> 04:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
hypothetical because obviously we don't
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
have image scanners at the moment that
 
04:20:13.969 --> 04:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
are taking pictures but if we did
 
04:20:16.670 --> 04:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming years
 
04:20:19.729 --> 04:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
um and we had future machines that could
 
04:20:23.389 --> 04:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
um immediately scan the ballot as it was
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
tabulating and Counting
 
04:20:28.370 --> 04:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
and be saved
 
04:20:32.290 --> 04:20:32.300 align:start position:0%
to some drive that would be available
 
04:20:35.389 --> 04:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
that would reduce the cost of the
 
04:20:35.399 --> 04:20:37.610 align:start position:0%
that would reduce the cost of the
request

04:20:37.610 --> 04:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:20:37.620 --> 04:20:38.389 align:start position:0%
request
um

04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
which would be affordable by the person
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
requesting the 91a would that be a
 
04:20:43.920 --> 04:20:45.650 align:start position:0%
requesting the 91a would that be a
feasible

04:20:45.650 --> 04:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
04:20:48.469 --> 04:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
change to the 91a request for these
 
04:20:48.479 --> 04:20:49.969 align:start position:0%
change to the 91a request for these
ballots

04:20:49.969 --> 04:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
04:20:51.769 --> 04:20:51.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for the good question I think
 
04:20:55.130 --> 04:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
that when we get to that point in time a
 
04:20:56.929 --> 04:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
couple years from now when communities
 
04:20:59.929 --> 04:20:59.939 align:start position:0%
do have highs I have ballot scanning
 
04:20:59.939 --> 04:21:01.490 align:start position:0%
do have highs I have ballot scanning
devices

04:21:01.490 --> 04:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
devices
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
um that that would be a much better time
 
04:21:06.830 --> 04:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to look at this bill
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
or a bill similar to this to see
 
04:21:12.530 --> 04:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
if it's a better
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
a better option at that point but to
 
04:21:17.650 --> 04:21:17.660 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony that that does not
 
04:21:21.290 --> 04:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
help half of our municipalities right
 
04:21:23.090 --> 04:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
now that do not have ballot scanning
 
04:21:23.100 --> 04:21:24.050 align:start position:0%
now that do not have ballot scanning
devices

04:21:24.050 --> 04:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
devices
 
04:21:26.570 --> 04:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
and I just want to remind people even if
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
a ballot scanning device was provided to
 
04:21:30.889 --> 04:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
a location there are annual maintenance
 
04:21:32.809 --> 04:21:32.819 align:start position:0%
fees related to that it's not just a
 
04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
one-time cost
 
04:21:36.769 --> 04:21:36.779 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
04:21:39.530 --> 04:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
Muirhead thank you
 
04:21:39.540 --> 04:21:40.550 align:start position:0%
Muirhead thank you
um

04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
I have a question about the length of
 
04:21:44.090 --> 04:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
time we're required to store ballots so
 
04:21:45.769 --> 04:21:45.779 align:start position:0%
I understand Federal elections according
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
to 33a3a
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's 22 months for non-federal elections
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
is just 60 days
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the good legal question my
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is yes it's 60 days and 22
 
04:22:00.349 --> 04:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
for federal however if there is
 
04:22:02.809 --> 04:22:02.819 align:start position:0%
legal action pending then you have to
 
04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
you can't destroy them so
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Brennan
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:22:13.689 --> 04:22:13.699 align:start position:0%
question the prime sponsor spoke about
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
a scenario where
 
04:22:20.210 --> 04:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
a voter might pursue 91a requests for
 
04:22:22.729 --> 04:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
ballots sift through those ballots to
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
try and find their own personal ballot
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
based on the way that they filled out
 
04:22:29.090 --> 04:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
that ballot
 
04:22:31.849 --> 04:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
given that scenario
 
04:22:31.859 --> 04:22:33.110 align:start position:0%
given that scenario
um

04:22:33.110 --> 04:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:35.929 --> 04:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
and I remember from other testimony
 
04:22:39.170 --> 04:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
about ballot marks and whatnot
 
04:22:39.180 --> 04:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
about ballot marks and whatnot
um

04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:44.510 --> 04:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
would that type of scenario become more
 
04:22:46.790 --> 04:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
common among voters like would this
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
invite voters to make unusual marks on
 
04:22:54.170 --> 04:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
their ballots so that someone could so
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
they could identify their own ballot if
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
they were trying to confirm whether or
 
04:23:03.290 --> 04:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:23:09.650 --> 04:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
yes perhaps that could happen yeah I
 
04:23:11.450 --> 04:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to remind people that
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes people sign their ballot and
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
put their name on it and do other
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
identifying things so there's also the
 
04:23:20.030 --> 04:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
secrecy issue that might come up follow
 
04:23:21.889 --> 04:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
up please follow up so would the
 
04:23:24.110 --> 04:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office be concerned
 
04:23:28.849 --> 04:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
about voter integrity and confidence and
 
04:23:32.689 --> 04:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
Trust in our elections if ballots were
 
04:23:34.809 --> 04:23:34.819 align:start position:0%
made available
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
to any
 
04:23:40.250 --> 04:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
American citizen that filed a right to
 
04:23:43.610 --> 04:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
know request given that
 
04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
someone that more people might make
 
04:23:51.950 --> 04:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.170 --> 04:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question I think I
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
think that we would have two concerns
 
04:23:58.210 --> 04:23:58.220 align:start position:0%
one being that
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
it could invite ballot purchasing
 
04:24:04.750 --> 04:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
schemes which would could be
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
intricate at that point
 
04:24:10.010 --> 04:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
um but also that you could lose your pro
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:16.250 --> 04:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:24:16.260 --> 04:24:17.210 align:start position:0%
further questions
um

04:24:17.210 --> 04:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:18.889 --> 04:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
I have some
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
um relating to ballot privacy how can
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
that be a concern of yours when we allow
 
04:24:24.050 --> 04:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
people to take pictures of ballots
 
04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
during recounts
 
04:24:28.370 --> 04:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
04:24:30.290 --> 04:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
um follow for follow-up or not even
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
follow up with different question what
 
04:24:34.429 --> 04:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of keeping these ballots
 
04:24:36.290 --> 04:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
if they're not
 
04:24:38.210 --> 04:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
to be made available like we're just
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
paying for 22 months of storage so like
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
why even store them if we can't look at
 
04:24:42.000 --> 04:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
why even store them if we can't look at
them

04:24:43.010 --> 04:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:24:45.170 --> 04:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure what what the federal
 
04:24:47.150 --> 04:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
guideline of 22 months the history
 
04:24:49.010 --> 04:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
behind that bike but I can get that for
 
04:24:51.650 --> 04:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
you and the last one is
 
04:24:53.929 --> 04:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
um we did a recount or I shouldn't say
 
04:24:55.729 --> 04:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
this is not this is the the Royal the
 
04:24:58.189 --> 04:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
Royal we not the personal way but there
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
was a recount conducted uh for state
 
04:25:02.330 --> 04:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
senate this last time that was outside
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
the three percent margin
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
um what was the cost of that and who
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
paid for it
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:25:10.439 --> 04:25:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:11.040 --> 04:25:12.889 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:25:12.889 --> 04:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
cost of that
 
04:25:19.729 --> 04:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
was in the thousands and I believe
 
04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
most most of the cost of that was paid
 
04:25:24.530 --> 04:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
for by the person requesting the recount
 
04:25:26.269 --> 04:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:27.889 --> 04:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
um any other questions would you like
 
04:25:30.170 --> 04:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
the exact details on it okay I'm more
 
04:25:32.090 --> 04:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
concerned who paid for it
 
04:25:33.469 --> 04:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
um that's it I think unless somebody
 
04:25:34.969 --> 04:25:34.979 align:start position:0%
else has their their point of questions
 
04:25:37.490 --> 04:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
they'd like to ask representative weary
 
04:25:40.250 --> 04:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
taking the question so the sponsor
 
04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
talked about really the intent being
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
um for the review of anonymous
 
04:25:48.720 --> 04:25:50.389 align:start position:0%
um for the review of anonymous
data

04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
data
 
04:25:52.370 --> 04:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
if if
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
the magical Money Tree exists and
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
scanners for everybody and that sort of
 
04:25:59.809 --> 04:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
thing does the Secretary of State's
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
office have any objections to the
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.290 --> 04:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so that
 
04:26:13.969 --> 04:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure I understand the
 
04:26:16.130 --> 04:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
anonymous data point
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:26:20.570 --> 04:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that we for voter
 
04:26:23.090 --> 04:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
confidence we do do post-election audits
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
now we started in uh in the primary we
 
04:26:28.910 --> 04:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
did two locations we did four in the
 
04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
general election there's a bill that's
 
04:26:33.410 --> 04:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate to make those continue
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
into the future without an end date and
 
04:26:38.689 --> 04:26:38.699 align:start position:0%
there's more audits that we would have
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do in the general election
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so to the point of
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
voter confidence that they're that the
 
04:26:47.689 --> 04:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
sponsor spoke to about their vote being
 
04:26:47.699 --> 04:26:48.830 align:start position:0%
sponsor spoke to about their vote being
counted

04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
counted
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
um I think that would help a voter to
 
04:26:53.689 --> 04:26:53.699 align:start position:0%
um have more confidence that when they
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
cast their ballot it was actually
 
04:26:56.929 --> 04:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
counted by the machine
 
04:26:58.250 --> 04:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
especially since there's a different
 
04:26:59.570 --> 04:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
type of machine that's doing the
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
counting then it's doing the counting
 
04:27:01.439 --> 04:27:03.469 align:start position:0%
counting then it's doing the counting
locally

04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
locally
 
04:27:05.570 --> 04:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
for the questions all right I think
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're done with your deputy secretary
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we did have one more pink
 
04:27:11.090 --> 04:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
card come in after you uh you started
 
04:27:11.929 --> 04:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
speaking as every Secretary of
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:24.410 --> 04:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
is that the 415 Amendment it is we
 
04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
already have that oh okay well you got
 
04:27:32.570 --> 04:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.670 --> 04:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you honorable members for the
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ellen Reed I represent
 
04:27:38.210 --> 04:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
rockinghamton that's New Market in new
 
04:27:38.220 --> 04:27:39.469 align:start position:0%
rockinghamton that's New Market in new
Fields

04:27:39.469 --> 04:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
Fields
 
04:27:41.330 --> 04:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
um and I did just pass out that language
 
04:27:43.969 --> 04:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
only because so many of the language the
 
04:27:45.889 --> 04:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
language section is identical to this
 
04:27:47.450 --> 04:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
current bill and so many of the
 
04:27:50.330 --> 04:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
questions that have come up so far
 
04:27:52.729 --> 04:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
um are answered by the language and most
 
04:27:54.349 --> 04:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
of the language just for full disclosure
 
04:27:56.990 --> 04:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
comes from my personal
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
um introduction of the bill well 2018 I
 
04:28:04.250 --> 04:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
introduced HB 1520 and then 2019 I
 
04:28:05.389 --> 04:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
introduced another one the number
 
04:28:07.370 --> 04:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
escapes me but it was nearly identical
 
04:28:10.370 --> 04:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
language and so most of the language in
 
04:28:13.130 --> 04:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I just sent around
 
04:28:15.290 --> 04:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
um is from those previous iterations
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
obviously before 2020 and all of that so
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
as you know from my testimony on HP 415
 
04:28:24.969 --> 04:28:24.979 align:start position:0%
I am in support of the concept of
 
04:28:29.889 --> 04:28:29.899 align:start position:0%
transparency and restoring 901a
 
04:28:34.849 --> 04:28:34.859 align:start position:0%
access to to to cast vote records or
 
04:28:37.849 --> 04:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
cast ballots so a few points that were
 
04:28:40.130 --> 04:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
brought up Supreme Court decision so
 
04:28:42.410 --> 04:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
obviously Supreme this was challenged
 
04:28:44.570 --> 04:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
the idea of it being exempt the Supreme
 
04:28:46.630 --> 04:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
Court said that it was constitutional
 
04:28:49.729 --> 04:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't mean you have to hold
 
04:28:52.010 --> 04:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
on to I mean that's all the work that we
 
04:28:54.889 --> 04:28:54.899 align:start position:0%
do right is changing law that ostensibly
 
04:28:56.870 --> 04:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
is constitutional so just because the
 
04:28:58.250 --> 04:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said that something is
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional doesn't mean that you
 
04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't change the law it just means
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
that they can't Strike It Down
 
04:29:05.510 --> 04:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to be very clear about
 
04:29:06.649 --> 04:29:06.659 align:start position:0%
that because there was some like well
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
how dare we overturn a Supreme Court
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
ruling it doesn't overturn the ruling it
 
04:29:11.389 --> 04:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
simply changes
 
04:29:13.490 --> 04:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
one constitutional law to a different
 
04:29:15.710 --> 04:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional law
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
um there is problematic language in this
 
04:29:20.570 --> 04:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
particular iteration of this bill as was
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
brought up like I said all of those
 
04:29:25.490 --> 04:29:25.500 align:start position:0%
questions are fixed I believe are fixed
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
quite adequately in the language that I
 
04:29:29.450 --> 04:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
sent around
 
04:29:34.250 --> 04:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
um for example the time to request 91a
 
04:29:37.490 --> 04:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
access to cast ballots is after the
 
04:29:39.530 --> 04:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
recount period has closed
 
04:29:42.530 --> 04:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
done you don't have any more concern
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
about well are you just doing this to
 
04:29:47.210 --> 04:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
overturn election results and integrity
 
04:29:51.889 --> 04:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.899 --> 04:29:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
oops

04:29:53.330 --> 04:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
oops
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
so um just very briefly some of the
 
04:29:58.729 --> 04:29:58.739 align:start position:0%
other issues and I do want to point out
 
04:30:01.309 --> 04:30:01.319 align:start position:0%
so the language separating out the idea
 
04:30:02.990 --> 04:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
of digital image from from actual
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
physical ballots
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to separate
 
04:30:09.229 --> 04:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
those two out the digital images are to
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
the extent they exist are already
 
04:30:13.130 --> 04:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
available under 91a and in fact the
 
04:30:14.510 --> 04:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice Federal Department
 
04:30:17.570 --> 04:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
of Justice released language two years
 
04:30:20.210 --> 04:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
ago saying that that had to be kept as
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
part of that 22-month period so even if
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's a digital image and in some cases
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
those those digital images are used for
 
04:30:29.630 --> 04:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
the purposes of counting
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
um my language says here that if someone
 
04:30:35.389 --> 04:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
uses an accessible system I understand
 
04:30:37.010 --> 04:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
the accessible systems now generate
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
identical ballots to the rest of the
 
04:30:39.530 --> 04:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
ballots but if somebody does use an
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
accessible system the moderators shall
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
have two other people use the same
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
accessible system so those ballots are
 
04:30:45.359 --> 04:30:46.269 align:start position:0%
accessible system so those ballots are
now

04:30:46.269 --> 04:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
removed from any personal information
 
04:30:52.969 --> 04:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
similarly any ballot that has an
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
identical identifiable marking on it or
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
about any absentee ballot that's the
 
04:31:00.110 --> 04:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
only absentee ballot in a Precinct those
 
04:31:02.330 --> 04:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
are removed from access as well those
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
are Exempted
 
04:31:04.199 --> 04:31:05.689 align:start position:0%
are Exempted
um

04:31:05.689 --> 04:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
as this bill also sets out a very
 
04:31:11.090 --> 04:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
detailed process for making sure that
 
04:31:12.830 --> 04:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
the security of the ballots is
 
04:31:15.050 --> 04:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
maintained by the town while still
 
04:31:19.130 --> 04:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
giving access to that viewing service so
 
04:31:21.050 --> 04:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'm happy I guess to answer any
 
04:31:21.060 --> 04:31:22.729 align:start position:0%
I'm happy I guess to answer any
questions

04:31:22.729 --> 04:31:22.739 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:31:24.649 --> 04:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
um but I didn't want to get too much
 
04:31:26.450 --> 04:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
into like literally an amendment on a
 
04:31:27.889 --> 04:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
different bill but it's so many of the
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
same questions have come up that I
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of bring that to the
 
04:31:33.849 --> 04:31:33.859 align:start position:0%
committee's attention
 
04:31:36.349 --> 04:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
procedurally so the Committees where
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
um we have to discuss the bills that's
 
04:31:39.050 --> 04:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
in front of us we don't have an
 
04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
amendment for this bill in front of us
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
we will be discussing 415 today during
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
executive session so if you do have any
 
04:31:46.490 --> 04:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
questions I am going to limit them to
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
the scope of the actual bill on the
 
04:31:48.359 --> 04:31:49.729 align:start position:0%
the scope of the actual bill on the
table

04:31:49.729 --> 04:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
table
 
04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
well that was easy made my disclaimer
 
04:31:58.130 --> 04:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
stop that all right thank you so much
 
04:31:59.809 --> 04:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
um representative wood can I grab the
 
04:32:05.929 --> 04:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:07.849 --> 04:32:07.859 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
two it's almost 2 30 representative
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
Elaine I will recess briefly mostly
 
04:32:21.370 --> 04:32:21.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.610 --> 04:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
yes yes okay uh the blue sheet is uh
 
04:32:28.189 --> 04:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
blank so with that I will bring to close
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh the public hearing on HP 387 the
 
04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee will stand in recess for 10
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.080 --> 04:33:07.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:07.730 --> 04:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.910 --> 04:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
there are people here what all right
 
04:33:15.010 --> 04:33:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's better
 
04:33:44.769 --> 04:33:44.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:47.029 --> 04:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
over there
 
04:33:47.039 --> 04:33:56.170 align:start position:0%
over there
yeah

04:33:56.170 --> 04:33:56.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:58.730 --> 04:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
it's actually checks checks the pressure
 
04:34:00.910 --> 04:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
in each one they're all down about us
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
and six or seven pounds so it's not a
 
04:34:03.600 --> 04:34:10.609 align:start position:0%
and six or seven pounds so it's not a
week

04:34:10.609 --> 04:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.010 --> 04:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
I find that happens sometimes I've
 
04:34:16.029 --> 04:34:16.039 align:start position:0%
noticed that the five Chief is
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
and then after I get the oil change and
 
04:34:21.529 --> 04:34:21.539 align:start position:0%
whatnot I find it I have to level like
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.131 --> 04:34:28.141 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be at 32. the four of
 
04:34:38.349 --> 04:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:21.650 --> 04:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:24.410 --> 04:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:56:27.470 --> 04:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
um next so if
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
which was always the plan
 
04:56:32.570 --> 04:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
um we have two days left to complete our
 
04:56:32.580 --> 04:56:33.770 align:start position:0%
um we have two days left to complete our
work

04:56:33.770 --> 04:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
so anticipate next Tuesday it should be
 
04:56:39.410 --> 04:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
a quite long day
 
04:56:41.628 --> 04:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
probably what I'll do is take all of the
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
bills that we have had public hearings
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
on and not exact and put them all up and
 
04:56:48.590 --> 04:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
we'll just chug through as many as we
 
04:56:48.600 --> 04:56:51.230 align:start position:0%
we'll just chug through as many as we
can

04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%

uh so
 
05:10:22.440 --> 05:10:23.390 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

05:10:23.390 --> 05:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill 415 is similar to previous
 
05:10:27.708 --> 05:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
bills that have been submitted and
 
05:10:31.070 --> 05:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative Reed was uh generously
 
05:10:35.690 --> 05:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
submitted this amendment with a
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
correcting a number of the issues that
 
05:10:37.920 --> 05:10:39.050 align:start position:0%
correcting a number of the issues that
are

05:10:39.050 --> 05:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:10:44.570 --> 05:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:47.330 --> 05:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
I believe everyone has a copy of this
 
05:10:47.340 --> 05:10:49.810 align:start position:0%
I believe everyone has a copy of this
and

05:10:49.810 --> 05:10:49.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:52.550 --> 05:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
I I think it addressed a number of the
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
issues that were raised during the
 
05:11:01.128 --> 05:11:01.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:09.370 --> 05:11:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:09.380 --> 05:11:11.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:11:14.570 --> 05:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
received it recently no
 
05:11:14.580 --> 05:11:16.250 align:start position:0%
received it recently no
okay

05:11:16.250 --> 05:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:16.260 --> 05:11:17.868 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

05:11:17.868 --> 05:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:11:20.750 --> 05:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
we're an executive session so
 
05:11:22.430 --> 05:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
we don't take testimony during
 
05:11:22.440 --> 05:11:23.510 align:start position:0%
we don't take testimony during
Executives

05:11:23.510 --> 05:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
Executives
 
05:11:25.850 --> 05:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
um I have a parliamentary inquiry yep
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
the um House Bill 415 and House Bill 387
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
are substantially similar dealing with
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
same subject in fact the same lines of
 
05:11:36.110 --> 05:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
the RSA so could anything that we look
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
at for 5 4 15 4 could we also look at
 
05:11:40.430 --> 05:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
387 not at the same time obviously we
 
05:11:42.050 --> 05:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
talk one bill at a time but would that
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
be procedurally allowable
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
so you're asking can we talk about
 
05:11:51.050 --> 05:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
387 well I I guess the bills are the
 
05:11:52.910 --> 05:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
bills are so similar not that we could
 
05:11:54.590 --> 05:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
talk about them at the same time
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
but it in theory these these bills they
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
deal with the same section of RSA so
 
05:12:00.110 --> 05:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
like what would be the process of
 
05:12:02.990 --> 05:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetically changing the amendment uh
 
05:12:05.390 --> 05:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
from 415 to 387 after this executive
 
05:12:07.610 --> 05:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
session would it be relatively easy
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
I understand we have an exact 387 yet
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
right so correct
 
05:12:13.970 --> 05:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
so you're trying to make the argument
 
05:12:15.470 --> 05:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment will work better on that
 
05:12:18.288 --> 05:12:18.298 align:start position:0%
bill uh I I believe it would and allows
 
05:12:20.930 --> 05:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
more time to work on the subject as a
 
05:12:22.610 --> 05:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
whole we could talk about 415 today
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
anything we wanted to do in theory we
 
05:12:27.288 --> 05:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
could do to 387.
 
05:12:29.330 --> 05:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay it's kind of thin ice but as long
 
05:12:34.490 --> 05:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
as the discussion is on the amendment
 
05:12:38.030 --> 05:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
and where it belongs so you're basically
 
05:12:40.128 --> 05:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
trying to all of you if you're going to
 
05:12:42.830 --> 05:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
discuss this argue that you don't want
 
05:12:45.050 --> 05:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
the amendment because you think it
 
05:12:47.930 --> 05:12:47.940 align:start position:0%
belongs on another bill correct
 
05:12:50.208 --> 05:12:50.218 align:start position:0%
all right we can do that
 
05:12:51.890 --> 05:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
thank you just check my lunch from the
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
clerk later yeah you know it's it's nice
 
05:12:55.250 --> 05:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
out and I wouldn't snowmobiling this
 
05:12:56.930 --> 05:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
weekend so I'm down to skating on some
 
05:12:59.390 --> 05:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:01.128 --> 05:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
um you know I may speak to for the
 
05:13:03.650 --> 05:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
amendment you may speak to the amendment
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
um the amendment gets really close to I
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
think where we need to be on the
 
05:13:09.288 --> 05:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
underlying issue
 
05:13:11.750 --> 05:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I would like more time to work on it
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
um we got the amendment this morning
 
05:13:15.470 --> 05:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
which is not enough time to review it
 
05:13:19.610 --> 05:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
but we did hear and testimony from 415
 
05:13:21.350 --> 05:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
um that you know certain things like
 
05:13:22.850 --> 05:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay for what would you
 
05:13:25.070 --> 05:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
when you can access it
 
05:13:26.690 --> 05:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
um I find it
 
05:13:28.730 --> 05:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
the arguments about not making these
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
ballots public documents is thin no no
 
05:13:34.670 --> 05:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
thin ice uh pun there just they're just
 
05:13:34.680 --> 05:13:36.170 align:start position:0%
thin ice uh pun there just they're just
thin

05:13:36.170 --> 05:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
thin
 
05:13:37.610 --> 05:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
um but I think we have some opportunity
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
to take the good language here in 415
 
05:13:43.250 --> 05:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
um continue to work on it with the bill
 
05:13:45.170 --> 05:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
sponsors and the people bringing forward
 
05:13:47.390 --> 05:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh find some common ground
 
05:13:48.890 --> 05:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can get another 20-0 vote
 
05:13:53.810 --> 05:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:02.930 --> 05:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead thank you uh the
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the amendment refers to
 
05:14:05.760 --> 05:14:07.730 align:start position:0%
the the amendment refers to
um

05:14:07.730 --> 05:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:10.250 --> 05:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
in various places it refers to a ballot
 
05:14:10.260 --> 05:14:12.010 align:start position:0%
in various places it refers to a ballot
custodian

05:14:12.010 --> 05:14:12.020 align:start position:0%
custodian
 
05:14:15.530 --> 05:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
or designee
 
05:14:15.540 --> 05:14:16.250 align:start position:0%
or designee
um

05:14:16.250 --> 05:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:19.970 --> 05:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
and so for instance page two line 28
 
05:14:21.890 --> 05:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
there's a custodian
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
custodian reappears at various points in
 
05:14:25.730 --> 05:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
in the uh such as page three line five
 
05:14:32.270 --> 05:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
page three line Thirty
 
05:14:32.280 --> 05:14:35.150 align:start position:0%
page three line Thirty
um and

05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:14:37.250 --> 05:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
and I it that that position is never
 
05:14:39.770 --> 05:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
defined or and so I just would invite
 
05:14:40.850 --> 05:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
those who are interested in this
 
05:14:42.288 --> 05:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
05:14:44.570 --> 05:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
direct their attention to that that
 
05:14:44.580 --> 05:14:54.948 align:start position:0%
direct their attention to that that
position

05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:58.970 --> 05:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:01.368 --> 05:15:01.378 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
I could follow up yeah please um for
 
05:15:05.930 --> 05:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
instance it it I infer that that
 
05:15:07.490 --> 05:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
position is invested with
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and that one of the
 
05:15:11.690 --> 05:15:11.700 align:start position:0%
responsibilities will be to ensure that
 
05:15:14.030 --> 05:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
those who are reviewing paper ballots
 
05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't Mark those paper ballots but those
 
05:15:17.810 --> 05:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
reviewing paper ballots only have
 
05:15:19.670 --> 05:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
pencils in their possessions no pens or
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
other marking devices and so it's it's
 
05:15:24.050 --> 05:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
actually a it's a it's a public office
 
05:15:26.810 --> 05:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
invested with formal responsibilities
 
05:15:29.330 --> 05:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
but those aren't ever defined in the in
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:33.948 --> 05:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
05:15:33.958 --> 05:15:35.510 align:start position:0%
I have a question
um remember

05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
um remember
 
05:15:37.850 --> 05:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
um I think when they refer to balak
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
custodian I think they're talking about
 
05:15:40.730 --> 05:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
the clerks or the Secretary of State's
 
05:15:42.288 --> 05:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
office so if that was just removed to
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
say Clerk or Secretary of State's office
 
05:15:46.330 --> 05:15:46.340 align:start position:0%
who represent possession of the ballots
 
05:15:49.368 --> 05:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
legally whoever's in Whoever has proper
 
05:15:51.288 --> 05:15:51.298 align:start position:0%
possession right so not not a brand new
 
05:15:53.510 --> 05:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
title called bowel custodian but the
 
05:15:55.550 --> 05:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
clerk uh or the Secretary of State as
 
05:15:56.930 --> 05:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
always would that would that alleviate
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
those concerns
 
05:16:02.510 --> 05:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
it would at least clarify what you know
 
05:16:04.368 --> 05:16:04.378 align:start position:0%
something about what
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
that person has meant who that person is
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
meant to be
 
05:16:11.930 --> 05:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
so um if I can just point out to uh
 
05:16:22.970 --> 05:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:25.010 --> 05:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
so is that language's existing statute
 
05:16:26.330 --> 05:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
though because it's not Boulder it's
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
Alex and I don't see a reference in
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
um here to add a new section against the
 
05:16:37.128 --> 05:16:37.138 align:start position:0%
new subdivision
 
05:16:39.350 --> 05:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
right here
 
05:16:42.530 --> 05:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
oh okay yes that's all new that's all
 
05:16:42.540 --> 05:16:45.650 align:start position:0%
oh okay yes that's all new that's all
new

05:16:45.650 --> 05:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
so basically out of the beginning of
 
05:16:49.368 --> 05:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
page two all the way to Pages yep I
 
05:16:49.378 --> 05:16:50.810 align:start position:0%
page two all the way to Pages yep I
understand

05:16:50.810 --> 05:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
but it's the Hidden Music representative
 
05:16:53.040 --> 05:16:54.050 align:start position:0%
but it's the Hidden Music representative
work

05:16:54.050 --> 05:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:16:57.890 --> 05:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so in page two
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
lines 17 through 20 where it talks about
 
05:17:02.050 --> 05:17:02.060 align:start position:0%
custody of the ballot I think the term
 
05:17:05.208 --> 05:17:05.218 align:start position:0%
custodian is introduced there and it
 
05:17:07.250 --> 05:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
refers to town and City Clerks and then
 
05:17:10.670 --> 05:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
if the Secretary of State
 
05:17:12.470 --> 05:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
um comes into possession of the ballots
 
05:17:12.480 --> 05:17:13.788 align:start position:0%
um comes into possession of the ballots
then

05:17:13.788 --> 05:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's where custodian is introduced so
 
05:17:17.090 --> 05:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:17:19.970 --> 05:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
I think it's referring back to that
 
05:17:21.410 --> 05:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
General paragraph and trying to
 
05:17:21.420 --> 05:17:22.610 align:start position:0%
General paragraph and trying to
encompass

05:17:22.610 --> 05:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
encompass
 
05:17:26.750 --> 05:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the definite the all the positions
 
05:17:29.090 --> 05:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
that could potentially have custody to
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
ballot in that
 
05:17:30.840 --> 05:17:34.190 align:start position:0%
ballot in that
section

05:17:34.190 --> 05:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:35.810 --> 05:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the on the
 
05:17:35.820 --> 05:17:38.390 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the on the
amendment

05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lane thank you
 
05:17:43.970 --> 05:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I am concerned about the effective
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
date it says it's still 60 days after
 
05:17:51.050 --> 05:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
its passage and I think as um we learned
 
05:17:53.690 --> 05:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
that that means it could be applicable
 
05:17:56.170 --> 05:17:56.180 align:start position:0%
to 2022
 
05:18:00.288 --> 05:18:00.298 align:start position:0%
records and I would also like to have it
 
05:18:02.390 --> 05:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
we've talked about addressing it so it
 
05:18:04.490 --> 05:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
only comes into existence when the new
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
voting machines come in that can can
 
05:18:11.150 --> 05:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
produce these images
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and even though it doesn't talk about
 
05:18:12.480 --> 05:18:14.570 align:start position:0%
um and even though it doesn't talk about
images

05:18:14.570 --> 05:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
images
 
05:18:16.610 --> 05:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
um I think there was kind of a long
 
05:18:19.368 --> 05:18:19.378 align:start position:0%
discussion on both bills when we did 415
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
and 387 about that concern so I and I
 
05:18:24.770 --> 05:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
haven't had time to go through this to
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
see but I am concerned that it's only 60
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:33.530 --> 05:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill
 
05:18:37.128 --> 05:18:37.138 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead thank you and I
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think I might like to change the
 
05:18:41.030 --> 05:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
amendment so that it says that towns and
 
05:18:43.128 --> 05:18:43.138 align:start position:0%
cities can transfer custody of the
 
05:18:44.570 --> 05:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
ballots to the Secretary of State's
 
05:18:44.580 --> 05:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
ballots to the Secretary of State's
office

05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
office
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
um immediately after the election or
 
05:18:49.550 --> 05:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
within a couple days after the election
 
05:18:50.930 --> 05:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
so that all the responsibilities
 
05:18:54.050 --> 05:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
associated with this with maintain with
 
05:18:55.730 --> 05:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
giving access and making sure that
 
05:18:57.288 --> 05:18:57.298 align:start position:0%
people don't Mark the ballots and
 
05:18:59.150 --> 05:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
watching them constantly while they're
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
being reviewed are carried out
 
05:19:03.708 --> 05:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
consistently across the state by one
 
05:19:07.850 --> 05:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.250 --> 05:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative Barry so I I would be
 
05:19:11.570 --> 05:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
fine with that
 
05:19:13.128 --> 05:19:13.138 align:start position:0%
um but I'd want a provision probably in
 
05:19:14.868 --> 05:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
there about if it was only if it was
 
05:19:17.090 --> 05:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
requested to for a ballot review I don't
 
05:19:18.530 --> 05:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
want to send all of our balance to the
 
05:19:20.030 --> 05:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office preemptively
 
05:19:20.040 --> 05:19:21.890 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office preemptively
right

05:19:21.890 --> 05:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:19:23.570 --> 05:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and we we kind of talked about this
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the hearing
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
um where you know right now when we
 
05:19:30.410 --> 05:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
conduct a recount the per a recount
 
05:19:31.250 --> 05:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's outside of the three percent
 
05:19:33.470 --> 05:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
margin right that person is responsible
 
05:19:35.690 --> 05:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
for the entire cost of that recount I
 
05:19:37.070 --> 05:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
like to make sure I know that there's a
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
provision here about payment but I'd
 
05:19:40.250 --> 05:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
like to make sure that it's something
 
05:19:41.810 --> 05:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
like that that's iron tight if you're
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to request to do this it's a
 
05:19:46.250 --> 05:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
laborious task that you are required to
 
05:19:48.890 --> 05:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
pay the estimated cost up front uh and
 
05:19:50.930 --> 05:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
then you're refunded any balance or
 
05:19:54.170 --> 05:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
responsible for any overage the
 
05:19:55.788 --> 05:19:55.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers shouldn't be responsible for
 
05:19:58.368 --> 05:19:58.378 align:start position:0%
this in any in Any Which Way
 
05:19:59.930 --> 05:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
um I couldn't vote for that if it was
 
05:20:01.310 --> 05:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
not like that so I'd like to see that
 
05:20:03.470 --> 05:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
change on it as well
 
05:20:05.330 --> 05:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
um but I I actually kind of like that
 
05:20:08.930 --> 05:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
idea of just having the SOS us do it
 
05:20:10.670 --> 05:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
we'd always have to talk to them but
 
05:20:12.590 --> 05:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
that would make it uniform they have the
 
05:20:15.070 --> 05:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
equipment already
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
they have a they have a cost structure
 
05:20:18.240 --> 05:20:19.690 align:start position:0%
they have a they have a cost structure
already

05:20:19.690 --> 05:20:19.700 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it kind of alleviates some of those
 
05:20:23.810 --> 05:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
concerns and then to representative
 
05:20:26.030 --> 05:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
Lane's point we could change the
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
language about these ballot images that
 
05:20:31.368 --> 05:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
we don't have yet we could put in a
 
05:20:33.288 --> 05:20:33.298 align:start position:0%
trigger that you know if that is
 
05:20:37.070 --> 05:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
available then you can access it
 
05:20:37.080 --> 05:20:38.150 align:start position:0%
available then you can access it
um

05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:41.090 --> 05:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
and I think that would solve the
 
05:20:42.650 --> 05:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
because you may have some towns that
 
05:20:44.930 --> 05:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
take a while to move over to the new
 
05:20:46.550 --> 05:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
machines they may stay on accuvote or
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
whatever and if that happens you don't
 
05:20:50.810 --> 05:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
want to force them to get a scanner or
 
05:20:52.850 --> 05:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
something but I think that would be
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
probably more appropriate and that that
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
alleviates all the costs because then
 
05:20:57.410 --> 05:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
you are just sending like a PDF or
 
05:20:59.448 --> 05:20:59.458 align:start position:0%
something and I think the other thing
 
05:21:02.330 --> 05:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
there's a spot in here about
 
05:21:02.340 --> 05:21:03.470 align:start position:0%
there's a spot in here about
um

05:21:03.470 --> 05:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:06.830 --> 05:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
none of this can be done until after the
 
05:21:06.840 --> 05:21:08.510 align:start position:0%
none of this can be done until after the
recounts

05:21:08.510 --> 05:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
recounts
 
05:21:10.310 --> 05:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
um does any money I want to make sure
 
05:21:12.288 --> 05:21:12.298 align:start position:0%
that that language has in there that
 
05:21:14.448 --> 05:21:14.458 align:start position:0%
it's recounts and Indie pending legal
 
05:21:14.458 --> 05:21:15.288 align:start position:0%
it's recounts and Indie pending legal
action

05:21:15.288 --> 05:21:15.298 align:start position:0%
action
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
because a recount as we have learned a
 
05:21:20.750 --> 05:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
recount does not always end on a recount
 
05:21:20.760 --> 05:21:21.890 align:start position:0%
recount does not always end on a recount
um

05:21:21.890 --> 05:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:24.170 --> 05:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
so I'd like I'd like to see that in
 
05:21:28.128 --> 05:21:28.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative wearing yes so um in page
 
05:21:37.310 --> 05:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
four line 14 any legal challenge to an
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
election has ended would accommodate
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
your request I believe uh yes uh where
 
05:21:44.690 --> 05:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
is that just so I can highlight it uh
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:54.650 --> 05:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
it should be changed to
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
um until the recount period has ended
 
05:21:58.990 --> 05:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
and in illegal
 
05:22:00.948 --> 05:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be an or it should be an
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:11.570 --> 05:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
for the discussion on the amendment
 
05:22:13.368 --> 05:22:13.378 align:start position:0%
representative weary thank you Mr chair
 
05:22:15.530 --> 05:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh just one other clarification I think
 
05:22:15.540 --> 05:22:16.910 align:start position:0%
uh just one other clarification I think
uh

05:22:16.910 --> 05:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:22:19.910 --> 05:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
was talking about the printed images on
 
05:22:21.590 --> 05:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
the bot toward the bottom of page four I
 
05:22:24.650 --> 05:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
think the implication in Roman numeral
 
05:22:26.990 --> 05:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
six is if used in the ballot counting
 
05:22:28.970 --> 05:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
process maybe that language needs to be
 
05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
cleared up so that it could be cited
 
05:22:34.490 --> 05:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
that if uh printed images are available
 
05:22:36.890 --> 05:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
you know are part of the ballot counting
 
05:22:40.190 --> 05:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
process then this provision could be uh
 
05:22:40.200 --> 05:22:44.990 align:start position:0%
process then this provision could be uh
accomplished

05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:48.250 --> 05:22:48.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's implied but not
 
05:22:52.610 --> 05:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:55.070 --> 05:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
05:22:57.470 --> 05:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
one more about the cost
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
representative Barry uh on the cost we
 
05:23:01.610 --> 05:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that it includes the
 
05:23:03.948 --> 05:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
transportation costs of the ballots I
 
05:23:05.448 --> 05:23:05.458 align:start position:0%
don't believe they currently charge for
 
05:23:08.330 --> 05:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
that but if a State Trooper is going to
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
go out there pick the ballots up and
 
05:23:11.090 --> 05:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
move it
 
05:23:13.010 --> 05:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
um that person who's requesting this
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be financially responsible for
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
obviously that mileage and that state
 
05:23:30.550 --> 05:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the amendment
 
05:23:36.350 --> 05:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I
 
05:23:38.150 --> 05:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
really like the
 
05:23:40.250 --> 05:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
um emphasis on making the requesters pay
 
05:23:42.110 --> 05:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
the costs and somebody mentioned in
 
05:23:43.850 --> 05:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
testimony today that there are
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
limitations of what can be charged to
 
05:23:48.530 --> 05:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
people who make 91a requests so if we're
 
05:23:50.570 --> 05:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
saying that this is a 91a eligible
 
05:23:52.430 --> 05:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
request as opposed to just something
 
05:23:54.830 --> 05:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
that people can request are we then
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
putting constraints on how much can be
 
05:23:57.360 --> 05:24:01.070 align:start position:0%
putting constraints on how much can be
charged

05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:03.530 --> 05:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Barry so I believe my
 
05:24:05.208 --> 05:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
reading of the amendment is that this is
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
actually not under the 91a process
 
05:24:11.930 --> 05:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
um it does mention 91a up there
 
05:24:14.750 --> 05:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
um but it's not I think in order to make
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
this work I mean it is a comp what we're
 
05:24:17.570 --> 05:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
attempting to do here is it's
 
05:24:20.090 --> 05:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
complicated right I I do not see a world
 
05:24:21.530 --> 05:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
in which it can actually operate under
 
05:24:24.948 --> 05:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
the 91a framework the 91a framework does
 
05:24:26.570 --> 05:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
not allow for the payment of every
 
05:24:28.310 --> 05:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
single cost and I think in order to get
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
this through you're going to need the
 
05:24:32.570 --> 05:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
entire cost to be borne by the person
 
05:24:33.948 --> 05:24:33.958 align:start position:0%
who is requesting this they're not a
 
05:24:35.270 --> 05:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
candidate they're not getting a recount
 
05:24:36.770 --> 05:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
they just want to see ballots in it
 
05:24:38.448 --> 05:24:38.458 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine I do view these as
 
05:24:39.530 --> 05:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
public documents but they need to pay
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
for everything and I don't think you can
 
05:24:43.128 --> 05:24:43.138 align:start position:0%
even do that under a 91a I think the the
 
05:24:45.170 --> 05:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
framework for 91a is just too rigid to
 
05:24:46.610 --> 05:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
accomplish that so it just happens to be
 
05:24:53.708 --> 05:24:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:58.670 --> 05:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes please representative Lynn
 
05:24:58.680 --> 05:24:59.570 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes please representative Lynn
um

05:24:59.570 --> 05:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:01.250 --> 05:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
I agree because otherwise I think we'd
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
have to amend 91a because at least a
 
05:25:04.970 --> 05:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
quick reading of it
 
05:25:07.970 --> 05:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
um earlier today was that it's just the
 
05:25:10.850 --> 05:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
cost of the copies it does not include
 
05:25:12.650 --> 05:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
Personnel it doesn't include this
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs it's just going to
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
be the cost of the copies pretty much so
 
05:25:20.270 --> 05:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do that we either me
 
05:25:24.590 --> 05:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
to reference 91a over to this or
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
and that makes it even more complicated
 
05:25:28.430 --> 05:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
so we probably need to look at that and
 
05:25:31.970 --> 05:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
see are we really amending 91a or
 
05:25:33.890 --> 05:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
creating our own
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:48.410 --> 05:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I I think so I
 
05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
agree with the logic there I'm not sure
 
05:25:54.230 --> 05:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
whether the um bill or the amendment is
 
05:25:57.288 --> 05:25:57.298 align:start position:0%
written so that this such that this is a
 
05:26:01.310 --> 05:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
separate review access right independent
 
05:26:03.890 --> 05:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
of 91a and so you know in revising the
 
05:26:05.810 --> 05:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
amendment some potential be need to be
 
05:26:09.230 --> 05:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
paid to page one lines 22 to 26 we might
 
05:26:12.050 --> 05:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
say that ballots just like it says in
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
the law right now ballots are exempt
 
05:26:17.390 --> 05:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
from 91a there's a different access
 
05:26:19.670 --> 05:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
provision that this law will
 
05:26:19.680 --> 05:26:20.868 align:start position:0%
provision that this law will
make

05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:26:22.850 --> 05:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
I I agree with that representative
 
05:26:27.288 --> 05:26:27.298 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you on page two
 
05:26:27.298 --> 05:26:29.628 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you on page two
line

05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
line
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
33 States any person wishing to review
 
05:26:35.270 --> 05:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
ballots may make a video recording of
 
05:26:37.970 --> 05:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
the viewing of the ballots
 
05:26:41.330 --> 05:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
um I have a concern about that that
 
05:26:43.128 --> 05:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
someone reviewing the ballots is making
 
05:26:45.470 --> 05:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
a video recording and can edit that
 
05:26:45.480 --> 05:26:46.330 align:start position:0%
a video recording and can edit that
video

05:26:46.330 --> 05:26:46.340 align:start position:0%
video
 
05:26:49.730 --> 05:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
to show ballots different from how they
 
05:26:53.150 --> 05:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
view in person which may raise some
 
05:26:55.010 --> 05:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
05:26:55.020 --> 05:26:55.730 align:start position:0%
concerns about
um

05:26:55.730 --> 05:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:59.330 --> 05:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
Integrity of those ballots
 
05:27:02.208 --> 05:27:02.218 align:start position:0%
um is it falsified
 
05:27:05.330 --> 05:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
the video to show something different
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
than what the ballots actually show in
 
05:27:10.190 --> 05:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
person so I that section for me does not
 
05:27:10.200 --> 05:27:13.788 align:start position:0%
person so I that section for me does not
work

05:27:13.788 --> 05:27:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:15.410 --> 05:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
representative Barry
 
05:27:18.590 --> 05:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
um so it's a it's a Fair concern you can
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
make the argument about a variety of
 
05:27:21.890 --> 05:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
things we currently allow people during
 
05:27:23.930 --> 05:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
recounts to take pictures of ballots in
 
05:27:26.090 --> 05:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
fact there is a reporter who shall
 
05:27:27.530 --> 05:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
remain nameless who literally shows up
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
and photographs every single ballot
 
05:27:34.910 --> 05:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so I guess my counter my Counterpoint
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
to that which is I I don't think it's a
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
completely dismissable recruitment it's
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
a legitimate concern but my Counterpoint
 
05:27:42.350 --> 05:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
to that is if there's concerns then
 
05:27:44.030 --> 05:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
we've just created a process in which
 
05:27:45.470 --> 05:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
somebody can come and look at it and be
 
05:27:46.850 --> 05:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
like oh they manipulated the video like
 
05:27:52.970 --> 05:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:55.730 --> 05:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
are we good
 
05:27:57.708 --> 05:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:28:00.890 --> 05:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to adopt
 
05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero seven zero three h in the
 
05:28:12.770 --> 05:28:12.780 align:start position:0%

05:29:24.650 --> 05:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:30.948 --> 05:29:30.958 align:start position:0%
19 days and oh 19 days and one yay
 
05:29:38.090 --> 05:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:39.470 --> 05:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
is there a question
 
05:29:41.208 --> 05:29:41.218 align:start position:0%
the question was on the vote count but I
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
don't think there was a second vote for
 
05:29:42.360 --> 05:29:55.850 align:start position:0%
don't think there was a second vote for
yes

05:29:55.850 --> 05:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:57.410 --> 05:29:57.420 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:30:00.350 --> 05:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
so we're back to the original motion of
 
05:30:04.910 --> 05:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
um Ocha pass on House Bill 14 and also
 
05:30:07.970 --> 05:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
the not adopting an amendment does not
 
05:30:10.010 --> 05:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
work like itl on a bill that doesn't
 
05:30:12.050 --> 05:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
mean the Topic's dead we just simply
 
05:30:14.270 --> 05:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
didn't adopt it so in the earlier
 
05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
discussion about perhaps it might belong
 
05:30:18.310 --> 05:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
better someplace else
 
05:30:20.930 --> 05:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
the amendment would still be in order on
 
05:30:23.390 --> 05:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
that as long as it fits that bill
 
05:30:25.730 --> 05:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
all right is there discussion on ought
 
05:30:28.910 --> 05:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
to pass on the underlying bill
 
05:30:31.128 --> 05:30:31.138 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr representative Barry I'm
 
05:30:33.110 --> 05:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
starting yes I'll be voting against
 
05:30:36.350 --> 05:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
um HP 415 as it currently exists
 
05:30:37.610 --> 05:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
um it's not ready for Prime Time
 
05:30:39.890 --> 05:30:39.900 align:start position:0%
although I do I have changed my mind on
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
this subject I voted against something
 
05:30:43.010 --> 05:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
similar against this last year I have
 
05:30:45.170 --> 05:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
changed my mind on this uh the good news
 
05:30:46.970 --> 05:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
is we have another vehicle to get this
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
done uh gives this committee a little
 
05:30:51.350 --> 05:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
more time so 415 is not ready for prime
 
05:30:53.690 --> 05:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
time but there's another bill that is
 
05:30:55.310 --> 05:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
that I believe we'll be able to work on
 
05:30:57.890 --> 05:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
and get ready for prime time
 
05:31:01.730 --> 05:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:01.740 --> 05:31:03.590 align:start position:0%

okay
 
05:31:05.390 --> 05:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
emotion is not to pass on House Bill
 
05:31:05.400 --> 05:31:07.430 align:start position:0%
emotion is not to pass on House Bill
415.

05:32:47.810 --> 05:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
I'm voting for itl for 4 15. the

committee will consider another vehicle
 
05:32:51.530 --> 05:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
for a similar subject which I will be
 
05:32:53.628 --> 05:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
supporting so I will not be voting for
 
05:32:55.070 --> 05:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
14 because we have a better vehicle
 
05:32:57.890 --> 05:32:57.900 align:start position:0%
