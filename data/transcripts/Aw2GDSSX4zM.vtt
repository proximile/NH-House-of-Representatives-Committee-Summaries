00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:50.569 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
we're going to start again we're going
 
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
to start off with um
 
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
as we recessed our
 
00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
discussion yesterday concerning
 
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
retirement bills a representative
 
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
Maguire I think has a fairly good idea
 
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
he'd like to go over the retirement
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
bills he's got some charts up here he's
 
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 align:start position:0%
going to create
 
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
as far as what they do and what he
 
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
understands them to do so representative
 
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
I read House Bill 436 in detail last
 
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 align:start position:0%
night I also have been I have a bill
 
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
that's related to the retirement system
 
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 align:start position:0%
so I've been trying to understand it
 
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
over time and it seems to me that it's
 
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
likely that the other members of the
 
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
committee don't understand
 
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
the same items in as much detail as I do
 
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
and so I think we should before we make
 
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 align:start position:0%
any decisions right we should understand
 
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
very clearly what's going on now and
 
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
what house bill 436 would change right
 
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
um just the facts right and so what I
 
00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
want to do is take I don't know it's
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to take half an hour an hour or
 
00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes and give you a lecture
 
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
about what's what's in the retirement
 
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
system what's in House Bill 436
 
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
Etc so
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
um but what I want you all to do is
 
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
listen to what I'm saying and when I say
 
00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 align:start position:0%
something wrong
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
point of order right whatever you know
 
00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah especially Marty but
 
00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.949 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah especially Marty but
everybody

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
here who thinks one thing and I think if
 
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 align:start position:0%
I say something that's incredible I'm
 
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 align:start position:0%
going to just try to stick to facts
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
right but
 
00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
um not not opinion or whatever we that
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
can be later but but I want to just
 
00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
explain right and
 
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and if I get something wrong
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
you know change fix it right right away
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
um because as you know you know the best
 
00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 align:start position:0%
way to learn something is to teach it
 
00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 align:start position:0%
right so that's what we're going to try
 
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
to do okay so first point is David you
 
00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 align:start position:0%
might want to sit on the side rather
 
00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:04.729 align:start position:0%
might want to sit on the side rather
than

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 align:start position:0%
that way okay yeah yeah
 
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
because I'm going to use these
 
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's is this visible the most
 
00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
if I stood here and
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
pointed like that okay
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
all right so let's start probably where
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
we should start
 
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.850 align:start position:0%
we should start
with

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.689 align:start position:0%
um
people

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.129 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.570 align:start position:0%
uh
so

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
we have there are two categories of
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
people involved in the retirement system
 
00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
right one
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
and one are people that are currently
 
00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
and one are people that are currently
retired

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.550 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
we we put them into two groups right we
 
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
call them
 
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
group one
 
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
and group two
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
um group two
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
are police and fire right and they have
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
they have a sort of beefier retirement
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
system because they have very stressful
 
00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 align:start position:0%
jobs and they're not expected
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to put this delicately
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
but but but they they wear out quicker
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
maybe and so um so they're not expected
 
00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
to have a longer as long a career as
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
someone with it with a less stressful
 
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
job right all right Marty one more thing
 
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
is they don't participate in Social
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
Security and they don't participate yes
 
00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 align:start position:0%
good point well good point so they so
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
the working the group one people have
 
00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
social security
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 align:start position:0%
right good point the life expectancy on
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
group two on the mortality the 10 years
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
exactly okay if anyone is to speak would
 
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
you please use the microphone because
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
folks outside can't hear your questions
 
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
so yeah if we can leave leave the space
 
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
there but what he said was and I'll
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
repeat it he said in group two these
 
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
folks have 10 years less life expectancy
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
than these so it is a stressful job no
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
question about it right okay
 
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.710 align:start position:0%
question about it right okay
um

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
has Social Security no social security
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
another reason for for a stronger
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
retirement system okay
 
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
um okay now
 
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
Within These groups are two subgroups
 
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
right so within group two
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
and there's five yeah
 
00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:56.409 align:start position:0%
and there's five yeah
right

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
prison guards which is a massive part of
 
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
the police side okay they're part of
 
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
right so so like in here
 
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
right your favorite documents Steve
 
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
yeah no I know but but in here there's
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
four categories yeah okay and and mostly
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
in law right they say permanent
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
policemen permanent firemen Etc yeah
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay all right but they are slightly
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
different and they have slightly
 
00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139 align:start position:0%
different uh rates and things like that
 
00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:32.270 align:start position:0%
different uh rates and things like that
okay

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
um but you but he's absolutely right the
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
largest or or a very significant group
 
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
in this category are Corrections
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
Officers yeah no question about okay all
 
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
right and then in group one
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
there are teachers we'll put them over
 
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.610 align:start position:0%
there are teachers we'll put them over
here

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:56.220 align:start position:0%
and other employees
 
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
so teachers are people that work for
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
schools right
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and I think not all right there's
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
some people who work for schools who are
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
not classified as teachers is that right
 
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:12.860 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah you know like School nurses
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals okay
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
office staff yeah exactly so they would
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
be in this category Marty could I get
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
you to you're probably going to field a
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
lot of the questions if you could just
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
use a mic there or sit at the sit at the
 
00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:31.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
we're having a
 
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.810 align:start position:0%
we're having a
current

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
not a finance discussion and I don't
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
really understand why that's occurring
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
here when we have a policy community in
 
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
the house that is already embedded and
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
gone through this bill in extensive
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
detail well well it's hard it's it's
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
really hard to appropriate the money
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
unless the committee the division has a
 
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
clear understanding how we got here so
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna let representative McGuire
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
continue because I think this may be
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
helpful to at least those of us on the
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
division I'm going to get the dollars
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
and cents before two months all right
 
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
um employees include both state
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
employees and
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
um Municipal Employees right the office
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
staff and and things like that okay uh
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
teachers uh okay good now according to
 
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
this and this is I don't know what it's
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
dated probably 2020. two
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
um pretty recent the number of people in
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
these categories currently we have about
 
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.790 align:start position:0%
these categories currently we have about
25

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
000 in this group
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
we have about 18
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
we have about 4 100 in this group
 
00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:58.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
all right and this does not say
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
um current sort of average compensation
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
in these groups so we'll leave that for
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
um but now we'll talk about retired so
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
people from this group who made it
 
00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:16.339 align:start position:0%
through through retirement are down here
 
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:18.860 align:start position:0%
and there's currently
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:25.820 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
thing I found out
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
when researching my other bill is that
 
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
very few of the people who start working
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the state in this area end up
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
getting vested and retired right so so
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
vesting occurs after 10 years and only
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
about 45 of the people who start here
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
remember if I say anything wrong
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not 100 sure on that
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
percentage but in terms of the people
 
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
who drop out of the system typically
 
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459 align:start position:0%
they're going to leave service in their
 
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
first you know one to five years when
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
somebody's here more than five they're
 
00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
much more likely to invest at 10 but
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
some people it's not not their cup of
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
tea so they move on yeah so those are
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
figures I got from Das fairly current so
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
so of the people that leave State
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
service again State service I don't know
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
about Municipal I would guess they're
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
roughly the same but it could be wrong
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
but of people who are leaving State
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
service this year
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
well a large more than half are
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
undestined okay
 
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:42.980 align:start position:0%
um now teachers teachers are
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:53.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:53.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
very few people leave right once you
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
start as a teacher you're going to
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
continue through the through the system
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
they have a very low low rate uh
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
leaving in police we have
 
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.350 align:start position:0%
leaving in police we have
um

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
four six
 
00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:16.730 align:start position:0%
four six
fifteen

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
fifteen
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:20.150 align:start position:0%
something like that
um

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
these these are a little bit the the
 
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
rate at which they leave service I think
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
is somewhere in between here but it's
 
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
fairly close to teachers they tend to
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
stick around and the number here is
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
something like that all right so
 
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.269 align:start position:0%
something like that all right so
um

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:49.980 align:start position:0%
so you can see that
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
in these in group one there's a little
 
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
bit fewer people retired than are
 
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
working in group two it's more equal
 
00:12:59.569 --> 00:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
right maybe even a little higher on the
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
retired side now the average pension uh
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
from from these people is from each is
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
quite different and remember there's no
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
Social Security on the on the group ones
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
but you know I mean there's no Social
 
00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
Security on the group two side there is
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
sort of a security in the zone okay so
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.459 align:start position:0%
now I really don't know what's the
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
average social security benefit of these
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
people but I'm you know I would guess
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's sort of
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
makes these all pretty similar anybody
 
00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:54.949 align:start position:0%
makes these all pretty similar anybody
know

00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
no okay all right so um
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the the number of
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
people in the whole system
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on to how to what
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay so someone's pension is the
 
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.199 --> 00:15:04.430 align:start position:0%
 
hi

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.509 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
a uh what does what is called average
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
we'll get into a lot of detail about
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
that because the definition of that is
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
key to house bill 436 and so on okay
 
00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.389 align:start position:0%
key to house bill 436 and so on okay
and

00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:24.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.170 align:start position:0%
um
times

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
um some some multiplier
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
we'll call it m for purposes here
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
um so that multiplier is also key to
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 43
 
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
436 right it's changing for the four
 
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
group twos okay
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
um so number of years
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
however many years somebody works 40
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
years 20 years whatever okay times
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
average final compensation some sort of
 
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
average of of years and and one of the
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
details is what's included in that and
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
how is that limited because there's this
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
is a very complicated section of law
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
about what's in that
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
and then this is a straightforward
 
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.370 align:start position:0%
and then this is a straightforward
number

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
and so let's talk about that number for
 
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
a moment
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
that number is if you're under
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
is it 6500 yeah yeah under 65
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
so the idea is you're not yet collecting
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
Social Security right that number is
 
00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:45.889 align:start position:0%
Social Security right that number is
160th

00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:47.579 align:start position:0%
all right so what is that a little
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
you're less than two percent one point
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
six five six five something you know
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
repeating forever five percent okay
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
all right if you're 65 Plus
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's 1 over 66.
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
so the idea is you started collecting
 
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
Social Security your pension goes down
 
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.150 align:start position:0%
Social Security your pension goes down
by

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
10 something like that that's 1.5 so
 
00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:18.530 align:start position:0%
10 something like that that's 1.5 so
yeah

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
So currently
 
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:31.580 align:start position:0%
uh there are two groups of group two
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
those who are vested
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
um prior to
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
is it January 1st 2012 or is it July 1st
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2012 vested by yeah right so
 
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2012 vested by yeah right so
invested

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
invested
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
meeting they have 10 years in right
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
that's been by
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
um uh January 1st
 
00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:56.210 align:start position:0%
um uh January 1st
12.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
12.
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
all right same groups
 
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:06.890 align:start position:0%
all right same groups
um

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.330 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
something wrong no yeah that's not right
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
but keep going well there are there are
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
multiple groups you have the you have
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
the medical subsidy group that you're
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
not including that ended in 2001 you
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
have the latter Group which is six
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
different categories and then you have
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
the post 2011 group so it's not two
 
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.230 align:start position:0%
the post 2011 group so it's not two
okay

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
so are those things significant yes
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
those are significant the medical
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
the medical subsidy difference although
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
it is true is not really relevant
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
because that's for a fixed group and it
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
is not changed by any legislation under
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
under consideration that's but is it is
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
it a is it a payment like salary or like
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
pension or is it a it's a statement it's
 
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
a stipend yeah stipend okay yeah it's
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's not part of the core pension
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
benefit it was something the legislature
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
added as a supplemental benefit in I
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
think 89 and then subsequently repealed
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
for the different groups over different
 
00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
periods of time but it it's it's one of
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
those benefits that is not
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
part of the actual pension it's a
 
00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539 align:start position:0%
premium offset a stipend you know for
 
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
the eligible members so it's real money
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
for people who would you know who retire
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
from a town and they're paying less for
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
their insurance okay you know from the
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
town but it's it's not it's a separate
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
it's separate from the pension so
 
00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:36.110 align:start position:0%
it's separate from the pension so
um

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
six retirees how many are getting
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
there are approximate approximately
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
about all counting all groups I mean I
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
can get a breakdown I don't have it in
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
front of me but there's there's about
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
um a little bit under 10 000 retirees
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
who are subsidily subsidy eligible and
 
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
the subsidy only applies if you're
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
getting insurance from the employer
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
you're retired from it's not a it
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't offset your insurance if you're
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
working for Fidelity or whatever so
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's about 9 800 people and it's a
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
closed group essentially oh so some of
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
them are over here yeah yeah there was
 
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
um yeah it was created as a group two
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
benefit teachers were added a year or
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
two later State Municipal employers were
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
added at different periods in the 90s
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
and taken out at different periods you
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
know in the early 2000s it's a flat
 
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.570 align:start position:0%
know in the early 2000s it's a flat
amount

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:26.900 align:start position:0%
um if you're subsidy eligible it's up to
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
375 dollars per person spouses are
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
included in that you know they can get a
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
subsidy as well uh for under 65 and once
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
the subsidy eligible person turns 65 and
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare or becomes their primary if
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
they're getting the Medicare
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
supplemental plan it's 236 a month is a
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
is a stipend towards that so it's fixed
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
dollar amount fixed population
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
um there are there are
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
probably a few hundred active group twos
 
00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
who can retire they had to be in service
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
on June 30th of 2000 to be subsidy
 
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.830 align:start position:0%
on June 30th of 2000 to be subsidy
eligible

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
some get a little bit more right some
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah plus
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh a thousand or two right so something
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
like that yeah 750. yeah you know if
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's if it's a married person at 750 a
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
month so what's that nine thousand a
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
year is medical subsidies significant
 
00:21:24.289 --> 00:21:24.299 align:start position:0%
you know so that yeah okay so for some
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
there's there's extra in both categories
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah but that group is never changing
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff right okay correct
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
um now
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
sorry yes sir
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
if you really want to go back to history
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
how that started was in 1988 when group
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
one got the Social Security offset they
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
had they took money out of the assist
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
pension fund 20 write down on the
 
00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
pension fund and to make it fair for
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
group two because we didn't get Social
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
Security that's why we got the health
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
care so they got the Social Security
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
offset we got the health care and then a
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
few years later group one complained
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
because we had health care even though
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
we got it because they got Social
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
Security offset they ended up getting
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
the health care never funded it and um
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
we ended up where we are now but that's
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's where it started in 1988 uh was
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
was when they got the Social Security
 
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
office said we got the health game we'll
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
try to push up okay if you paint the
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
picture we gotta do the whole thing okay
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
all right so invested two points right
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
now not invested so
 
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
not invested in at 1 112 right so uh
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
younger than that right if you were not
 
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
10 Years yet at that point
 
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:43.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
well it goes down from 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
to 2.0 oh yeah depending on you know
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
very good so 2.4 2.3
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
2.2 does not have a grip on this if we
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
have to keep 2.1
 
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.649 align:start position:0%
have to keep 2.1
2.0

00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
2.0
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's really three groups
 
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.169 align:start position:0%
yeah so there's really three groups
right

00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:23:06.179 --> 00:23:07.970 align:start position:0%
right
there's

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
kind of another line there
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
you're right okay so this one
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.100 align:start position:0%
this day or early yes
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
let's see the the bottom that where the
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
2.0 is that's anybody hired after uh
 
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
seven one of eleven
 
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.090 align:start position:0%
seven one of eleven
seven

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.770 align:start position:0%
seven
eleven

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
eleven
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:43.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so this is
 
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
they were hired
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh before seven one of eleven this room
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
yeah and not invested by one one as well
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
it had didn't have ten years in yeah
 
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:00.740 align:start position:0%
okay and and they have
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
these do they have are there some of
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
those that are 2.0 no no okay so they're
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
only two point ones two point twos two
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
point threes and two point fours yeah if
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
if you if you want to add more
 
00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:15.539 align:start position:0%
parentheticals that the the the the 2.4
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
is for people who had less than 10 but
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
more than eight the 2.3 was less than
 
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
eight but more than six
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
um the 2.1 was zero to 40 but less than
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
four okay so so that's that's where
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
there's a tier within a tier there four
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
we should be teaching
 
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.770 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
four clubs
 
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:51.909 align:start position:0%
four clubs
yeah

00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
so what about the ones zero to two years
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
okay it's it's zero to four is the 2.1
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
so you know that's zero zero to four
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I bet yeah
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
all right so this is the biggest group
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
of these yeah okay so this has sort of
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
four years worth of people two years two
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
years two years yeah like that and
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
there's there's a minimum retirement age
 
00:25:15.409 --> 00:25:15.419 align:start position:0%
goes up as the multiplier goes down in
 
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
that uh you're probably gonna get to
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
all right yes there's other
 
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.850 align:start position:0%
all right yes there's other
um

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
other requirements okay
 
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:28.460 align:start position:0%
so is that enough for that page
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
so the main point here is that
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
for this group
 
00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:36.590 align:start position:0%
for this group
um

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:39.419 align:start position:0%
two percent so so think about it
 
00:25:39.419 --> 00:25:42.110 align:start position:0%
two percent so so think about it
essentially

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.549 align:start position:0%
essentially
um

00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
to get your final compensation your
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
pension to be equal to your your average
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
final compensation right at two percent
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have 50 years of service
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
right very few people ever would get
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing right
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
um some maybe but not too many but here
 
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
it'd be 40 years
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
right so we're talking about like a like
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
a depending on how you look at it a 20
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
or 25 difference from from this to that
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay and this is a sliding skip okay
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.289 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
let's get to the definition of
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.539 --> 00:26:54.409 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
so there are two important definitions
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
in law
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
and the other is called average final
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
and one feeds into the other
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
RS let's get this right here
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.250 align:start position:0%
 
100

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
100
Dash

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
colon one so it's in the definitions
 
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.390 align:start position:0%
colon one so it's in the definitions
area

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and earnable compensation is part
 
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.890 align:start position:0%
um and earnable compensation is part
17.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
17.
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
and average final computation is part
 
00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:57.289 align:start position:0%
and average final computation is part
18.

00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.299 --> 00:27:58.610 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about what's in current
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:09.659 align:start position:0%
so current law
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
has a two different
 
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.909 align:start position:0%
has a two different
um

00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
two different definitions
 
00:28:16.919 --> 00:28:17.810 align:start position:0%
two different definitions
um

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
actually well
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
okay so it has
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
two different sections here right
 
00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:28.010 align:start position:0%
two different sections here right
so

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
it has those who are vested prior to 112
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
before

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:56.029 align:start position:0%
 
invested

00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.039 --> 00:28:58.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:02.690 align:start position:0%
all right and
um

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
so the main differences between these
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
two so
 
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:07.610 align:start position:0%
two so
um

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
is that it's a full base rate of
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.029 align:start position:0%
okay
well

00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:36.649 align:start position:0%
 
station

00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
Etc there's a few other things
 
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.930 align:start position:0%
Etc there's a few other things
um

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.570 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
but there are some limitations all right
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
so limitations are
 
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.130 align:start position:0%
so limitations are
that

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:55.850 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
are specifically on extra instead of PVP
 
00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.190 align:start position:0%
are specifically on extra instead of PVP
extra

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
in current law this is the same for
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
group one and group two
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
right there's there's not a there's not
 
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
a group one difference and a group two
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
difference it's it's the same definition
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
of all this stuff okay
 
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:23.630 align:start position:0%
of all this stuff okay
um

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
so up here
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
the so extra and special Duty as I
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
understand it that's not overtime right
 
00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:33.769 align:start position:0%
understand it that's not overtime right
that's

00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:30:33.779 --> 00:30:34.850 align:start position:0%
that's
um

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
when you're wearing your uniform and
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
doing other things that's that's
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
um yeah work done for a third party
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's reimbursed to your employer and
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
the employer still pays you but it you
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
know it you know the easiest one is you
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
know like you know Highway you know you
 
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
know they're doing the power lines and I
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
need somebody to direct traffic so it's
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
a you know work done for a third party
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
reimbursed to the town and then the town
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
pays the the traffic control event or
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah right yeah okay
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
so in the case here
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
um extra and special duty pay
 
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.269 align:start position:0%
um extra and special duty pay
um

00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:09.649 align:start position:0%
um
is

00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:11.269 align:start position:0%
is
Limited

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
Limited
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
during the highest three years of
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
preventable service
 
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
all right so so there's some limits
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
basically limits
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
right versus the high three whichever
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:34.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:34.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
there's also a limit in your last 12
 
00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
months of employment
 
00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:42.179 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:31:42.179 --> 00:31:43.190 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
let's see any compensation received in
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
the final 12 months in excess of all
 
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.220 align:start position:0%
right it is that
 
00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.350 align:start position:0%
right it is that
um

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:53.940 align:start position:0%
in the last 12 you can't have more than
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
one and a half times the the
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
um previous 12 months yeah that's
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
referred to as 150 rules and what you
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
explained on that extra and special duty
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
is a seven year averaging those are both
 
00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking Provisions neither of which
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
has to be less than or equal to
 
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
just for additional color on that that
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
was put in in the early 90s and if if
 
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
someone ex their payment from their
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
employer exceeded the 150 cap in their
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
final year you know just say they
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
doubled their salary for whatever
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
reasons they would still be paid that
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
money from the employer but anything
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
over that 150 can't be used as part of
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
the average final comp is Honorable com
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
for calculating the AFC
 
00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not like they can't make
 
00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
more but we can't and the retirement
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
system can't count it we're talking
 
00:33:00.899 --> 00:33:01.970 align:start position:0%
system can't count it we're talking
about

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
going into creating this number right
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about what people
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
actually get in checks while they're
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
working yeah they actually get paid for
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
whatever work they actually do yeah okay
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
so but this is for the purpose of
 
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
calculating how much compensation you
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
have and basically what's going to
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
happen is
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
um you're going to have a certain amount
 
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
of compensation each year and then we're
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to take an average of a certain
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
number of years to get this number okay
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
so we're going to take this and average
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
it uh from some number of years of this
 
00:33:44.269 --> 00:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
okay all right so now
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
um let's look at uh these this group The
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
the more recent uh people the younger
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
younger people okay
 
00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.049 align:start position:0%
younger people okay
so

00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:57.059 --> 00:33:58.490 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
same thing it's got
 
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.909 align:start position:0%
same thing it's got
um

00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's at uh cost of living et cetera Etc
 
00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:20.869 align:start position:0%
it's at uh cost of living et cetera Etc
um

00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
is key things that it does not have is
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have this vacation and sick
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
day right so occasion
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
and sick pay
 
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
 
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.149 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
okay

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
and I don't see anybody jumping up so I
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:49.790 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
it is subject to certain limitations
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay there's there's other limitations
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
go back to black no the same yeah with
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
the second vacation that it the statute
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
it distinguishes you know if you if I
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
had a day off today and it wasn't here
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
you know that's part of my pensionable
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
wages because I took the time this this
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
is unused sick and vacation is what
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't count for the the non-vested
 
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
people so that's leave accruals that you
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
have either you get paid out at the end
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
of your career or some employers make
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
you you'll pay out every year whatever
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
so so what we're talking about here is
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
so this is an aspect of spiking right
 
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.030 align:start position:0%
so this is an aspect of spiking right
because

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:35.569 align:start position:0%
because
um

00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:35.579 --> 00:35:37.069 align:start position:0%
um
no

00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with that statement okay
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll just say what it is
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
you're in this group and you retire with
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know six months of vacation
 
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.450 align:start position:0%
I don't know six months of vacation
right

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
um presumably you're subject to the 150
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
percent rule yes okay always okay so
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
um but that could kind of get you
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
towards 150 right let's say your last
 
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
year you you work the same as the year
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
before but you had six months worth of
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
vacation and sick pay saved up then you
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
would be at 150 percent in that last
 
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
year versus 100 Yes except you can't
 
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
accrual vacation time fast no one can
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
accrual vacation time that fast
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
so you're not you're acting like you're
 
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
in a position where you're going to do
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
that twice and that's not possible no
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
employer offers that
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
are you saying there's a limit on how
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
much you can approve
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any municipality nodding
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
heads in the back I don't know a single
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
municipality left that does not have
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
limits or has completely eliminated it
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
totally okay
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
so you guys in the back how much a
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
vacation and sick time can you approve
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:52.220 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:00.020 align:start position:0%
everybody's different
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay so he said you could Bank 900 hours
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:13.850 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.410 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:17.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
so if you have 900 hours the state will
 
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
kill 450 away from you and they will pay
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
you only for 450 yards at the end yes
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah with with the sea
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
contract with with most state employees
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
that there are maximum amounts of
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
vacation and sick time you can accrue
 
00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
and the longer you work the higher those
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
limits get uh he's right that it it and
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
and for the sick time payoffs with the
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
state you only receive them from the
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
state if you go straight into retirement
 
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
if you file for retirement before
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
terminating employment if you are you
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
know 42 and you're not going to retire
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
you can't retire that all walks away you
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
would still get your vacation time paid
 
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
out because that was earn time and just
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
just to to you know every employer you
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
know has their own policies or their own
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
contracts their own cbas so they may
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
treat accruals you know different in you
 
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
know Henniker versus Warner versus
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton you know like they might have
 
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
different caps and things like that and
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
that's something the retirement system
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't track
 
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
um so you know but it's going to vary
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll put a we'll put a
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
little I don't know question mark around
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
this one so if I may it may or may not
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
in this representative McGuire yes just
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
a quick one that is that's all
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
negotiated mostly through cities and
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
towns through contractual agreements
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
sick leave and vacation time and they're
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
they're all different depending on the
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
department you're working for right
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
um yeah so but it's still
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
for this group
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is it's included
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
this group not include but I can tell
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
you just historically like in Manchester
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
they would in contracts they would give
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
us more sick time because they didn't uh
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
that would be in in lieu of uh overtime
 
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
you know so it's all contractual and a
 
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
lot of times they gave us sick time to
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
to save money
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
um you know it would actually save save
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
the city money by giving us the sick
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
days right but the question is how does
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
it affect tensions well I can tell you
 
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
in Manchester weekend accrue I don't
 
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
know if it's changed I've been off for a
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
while but they used to be able to accrue
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
120 days they get paid 90 when they they
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
leave but I think that's even changed
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
so some of this
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
when you when you're in this category
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
some of this can get into your
 
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
compensation which will end up in your
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
pension but in this category none of it
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
can get into your pension yes
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
that Prozac yeah so what ends up
 
00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
happening is instead of a town paying
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
out unused vacation time at straight
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
time people take all their vacation and
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
their Replacements are paid at time and
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
a half it is done as a cost saving
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
measure for the municipalities that is
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
why they do it and it's also in essence
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
a cost-saving measure for the pension
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
system because you don't have senior
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
people getting time and a half to cover
 
00:40:16.849 --> 00:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
something that could have been cashed
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
out in stray time that's why this still
 
00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.910 align:start position:0%
out in stray time that's why this still
exists

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
and that's why this hasn't gone away
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
so Steve
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
trying not to get into why but you why
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
is part of this that's why that you have
 
00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
a policy committee to learn about the
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
why we're trying to do the what at the
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
at this point okay all right and you're
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
all when you get you got to do a third
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
bar because you're missing a big part
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
here so keep going okay
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.849 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
extra and special right so there's also
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh maybe I should do this in in Revenue
 
00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:58.790 align:start position:0%
uh maybe I should do this in in Revenue
um

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
so compensation for
 
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.810 align:start position:0%
so compensation for
um

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
um unusing time conversion yeah so there
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.970 align:start position:0%
there are
um

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:18.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that you read this last
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
night and you're trying to explain it to
 
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
US Representative McGuire but there are
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
people that have studied this for years
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
and years and years
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
but that's what you said you said you
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
said you went over it last night so I'm
 
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
just trying to yeah and so
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
I think that is I'm sorry to say this
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
but I think that may be more than my
 
00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.829 align:start position:0%
but I think that may be more than my
compatriots

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
compatriots
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
and but if you're talking about a
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
substantive policy change in a finance
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee based on something you're
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
trying to explain that you learned last
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
night Steve please
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
all right let's just listen to
 
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and okay we'll
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
keep correcting them but that's fine
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
all right so what he's talking about is
 
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.089 align:start position:0%
all right so what he's talking about is
um

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:05.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
there's another group after July 1st
 
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
right so this is
 
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.990 align:start position:0%
right so this is
um

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:21.650 align:start position:0%
 
after

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
seven one eleven
 
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.170 align:start position:0%
seven one eleven
right

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:26.180 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:29.780 align:start position:0%
hired after seven one eleven
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
there is no extra and special duty pay
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.970 align:start position:0%
 
special

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
you might want to note that in your
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
middle box those people that were were
 
00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.290 align:start position:0%
middle box those people that were were
hired

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
hired
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
with that in their compensation package
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that is an important part of this
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
bill so they had that as a condition
 
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
upon their hiring
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
within that time frame that is the cross
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
book 436 here
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
is that or call them article 23 people
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
that might be more appropriate
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
people whose pensions were retroactively
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
altered that's that middle group so
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to explain what's actually in
 
00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:32.210 align:start position:0%
I'd like to explain what's actually in
law

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
um but what you're saying is why such
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
and such right so I'm trying well just
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
describe that middle group correctly so
 
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
people can understand it okay they were
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
hired under those conditions
 
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.069 align:start position:0%
hired under those conditions
yeah

00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
see that is known and assumed yeah no I
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't know because we're saying that
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
people on the committee don't not that
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
are unaware of all the conditions of
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
this I just want to make sure that it's
 
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
that they're getting the full picture
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
sort of what he's saying I think is that
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
this section of law
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
has never changed for this group is that
 
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
right no no see so
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
so this is the current condition in law
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
for this group of people yes
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
yes it is okay
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
all right this is the condition group
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
for this group all right
 
00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.470 align:start position:0%
for this group all right
now

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
all right so that's
 
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.710 align:start position:0%
all right so that's
um

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
so there are other
 
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.510 align:start position:0%
so there are other
um

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
minor this also has this 150 thing is is
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
throughout right so so
 
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
um what I'm writing here is the
 
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
differences from this
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay so this is this is the ones that
 
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
have in some sense the best deal right
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
they they have the most things cut
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
counted in here which feeds into here
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
which feeds into the pension this has a
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
little bit less and this has a little
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
bit less yes okay all right good all
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
right now let's go to the other side
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
average final compensation
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.930 align:start position:0%
so we have
um

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.849 align:start position:0%
um
vested

00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
vested
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
before same thing right that's invested
 
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.370 align:start position:0%
before same thing right that's invested
before

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:33.380 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh one one twelve
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
here we have
 
00:45:38.339 --> 00:45:40.390 align:start position:0%
here we have
tired

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
tired
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh after
 
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.349 align:start position:0%
uh after
seven

00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh one
 
00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
eleven and here we have
 
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.790 align:start position:0%
eleven and here we have
um

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:02.900 align:start position:0%
who have not got oh I'm sorry
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
the law is written backwards this this
 
00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:08.579 align:start position:0%
group is written this group is written
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
before that one
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
so it's there so um
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
seven one eleven this is actually part C
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
of the law this is part A this is part C
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is part B who knows why okay and um
 
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
and this is higher
 
00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.829 align:start position:0%
and this is higher
after

00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
seven one
 
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.370 align:start position:0%
seven one
okay

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.670 align:start position:0%
all right
so

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.950 align:start position:0%
this is
um

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.069 align:start position:0%
okay
but

00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a butt here
 
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.210 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a butt here
um

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's some limitations on extra and
 
00:47:10.809 --> 00:47:10.819 align:start position:0%
special duty pay
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
in these three years
 
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's this this thing
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
this this definition is actually
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
repeated sort of in here right so the
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
the seven year average on extra special
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
duty pay it applies to the what would be
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
in these three years right so there's
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
some limitation
 
00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.190 align:start position:0%
some limitation
okay

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:39.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
I told you it would be a little long but
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
I've been interrupt
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:57.740 align:start position:0%
you want to take a break no no okay
 
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
I get it all right so this and we
 
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:03.140 align:start position:0%
haven't even got the house bill 436.
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
so this is a five-year average not three
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
right so this is gonna be a smaller
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
number just from that alone
 
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:13.490 align:start position:0%
number just from that alone
um

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.170 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.349 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:26.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's a limitation
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
on this uh this average
 
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.950 align:start position:0%
on this uh this average
and

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.390 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
so okay so so they introduce this
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
concept of Base
 
00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.290 align:start position:0%
concept of Base
Plus

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
extra okay
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
maybe we should use the word X base plus
 
00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:51.650 align:start position:0%
maybe we should use the word X base plus
um

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:55.309 align:start position:0%
 
Facebook

00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
you have your base pay but you have all
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
kinds of extras right and so there's a
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
limitation on this that's different in
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
these two cases right so base
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
plus compensation over base
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
um is on the
 
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.150 align:start position:0%
um is on the
um

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
minus the high five years
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
no right that was taken out in house
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
bill 1587. that that's for the bottom
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
so this is based this limit is based on
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
the career
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
again it's backwards because all right
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
this one is career
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
minus the high five years okay
 
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.410 align:start position:0%
minus the high five years okay
so

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
and this particular little change
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
career career minus high five years
 
00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
was added last year a year ago
 
00:50:10.619 --> 00:50:12.890 align:start position:0%
was added last year a year ago
okay

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:15.849 --> 00:50:15.859 align:start position:0%
um and this is
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
42 million dollars right it was removed
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
it was changed it wasn't really added or
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
subtracted the calc was changed right
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
this calculation would change right a
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
year ago
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
there was only one category here yes
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
yeah right there was one category like
 
00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
that okay so a year ago
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no like this right a year ago
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
it was like this right if you were uh if
 
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
you were vested before three year
 
00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:49.220 align:start position:0%
average if you were vested afterward
 
00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
five-year average and the limitation on
 
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
on these extras
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
and the limitation was based on
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
the way your career was I guess the
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
concept is
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
um if you're earning extras in your
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
final five years the five years that
 
00:51:06.119 --> 00:51:07.809 align:start position:0%
final five years the five years that
count

00:51:07.809 --> 00:51:07.819 align:start position:0%
count
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
that is similar to the rate you're
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
earning them in your rest of your career
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
that's fine right you're you're not
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
doing anything different in your final
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
five years but if in your final five
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
years your earnings
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
jump compared to the rest of your career
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
right then they want to limit it okay
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of your pension right
 
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
so but last year
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
for this particular group this
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
particular group was created and this is
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
the group that's affected by House Bill
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
436 primarily
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeah they took away
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
the the final five years from this
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
calculator the the high five they they
 
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
made this the entire career rather than
 
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
the whole career not including the the
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
highest five years
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay so that made that made this number
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
bigger than that number right and so
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
whatever so but that was paid for last
 
00:52:06.059 --> 00:52:08.030 align:start position:0%
whatever so but that was paid for last
year

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
um at about like I said about 40
 
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
something million dollars okay
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:38.339 align:start position:0%
okay all right now let's talk about
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.849 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
is just the definition
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's not all right
 
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
section number two changes earnable
 
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.990 align:start position:0%
section number two changes earnable
compensation

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay the First Column there
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
so it it has four sections group one
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
group two well group one prior to a
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
certain date group uh one after a
 
00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:44.339 align:start position:0%
certain date group two uh the three
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
groups right the three the three
 
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
sections okay
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
um and it actually doesn't
 
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.049 align:start position:0%
um and it actually doesn't
uh

00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's not much change
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
per se in these sections right and the
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
these sections are essentially a copying
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
current law but they're they're in here
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
for a reason which we'll explain in a
 
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.150 align:start position:0%
for a reason which we'll explain in a
minute

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
minute
 
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:08.930 align:start position:0%
minute
um

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
but as far as I can tell
 
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.589 align:start position:0%
but as far as I can tell
um

00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
these sections are currently copies
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh it breaks them out right there's now
 
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
two middle
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
and group two after right now okay
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
but I don't think the way they're
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
written they're not very different from
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
what's there
 
00:54:46.859 --> 00:54:50.270 align:start position:0%
what's there
yes

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think what the bill is do not
 
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
in that section but what the bill is
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
doing is is over year over year
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
enactments moving some group two members
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
in that the hired before seven one of
 
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
eleven not vested into the uh you know
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
the the top definition of absolutely so
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get to that in a minute okay
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
but but but as far as the bill is
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
concerned this is just sort of a
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
restating but it's breaking it up into
 
00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
pieces because it's going to change who
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
where's the boundary between these two
 
00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:26.690 align:start position:0%
where's the boundary between these two
pieces

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay so the boundary between the date
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
is going to change here right so what's
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
going to happen is people who right now
 
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
are in this category using that
 
00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:45.059 align:start position:0%
definition are going to move into this
 
00:55:45.059 --> 00:55:46.069 align:start position:0%
definition are going to move into this
group

00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
okay they're going to move into the
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
group they were hired under yes yes okay
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll agree on that no okay no
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
okay but I don't see but like I said I
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't see any substantive
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
changes at first to these groups with
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
with sort of one exception
 
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
and that is the date in question any
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
date that I see this date in the middle
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
group here
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
um after 1 1 12 right in the bill it's 1
 
00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:20.579 align:start position:0%
1 13.
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay now my reading of the bill is that
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
might be an error okay because later
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
when we change things we're going to say
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
go to that paragraph and change one one
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
twelve to one one something no later it
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
says one one thirteen to one one
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
fourteen it is not an error okay all
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
right we'll we'll look at it
 
00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.849 align:start position:0%
right we'll we'll look at it
um

00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
all right so anyways the point is all
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
throughout this section the main change
 
00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
is that the twelves one one twelve in
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 become one one thirteen
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
which sort of automatically
 
00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:03.710 align:start position:0%
which sort of automatically
moves

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
moves
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
one year's worth of these people into
 
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
this group
 
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
okay from from day one sort of from when
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
the bill passes well the effective date
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
which is January of 24. okay
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
which is which is important right and so
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
the key difference is if you look at
 
00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.510 align:start position:0%
the key difference is if you look at
that

00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
what used to be
 
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:23.990 align:start position:0%
what used to be
um

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
the The Five-Year average for that
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
particular group will become the
 
00:57:31.609 --> 00:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
three-year average right and these other
 
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:34.260 align:start position:0%
limitations on
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
um vacation and sick pay uh and special
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
duty pay and this cob thing
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
will will go away and become those other
 
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
limitations it'll become the 150 rule of
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
the seven year
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay so right away
 
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
for one year's worth it's going to be in
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
that group okay
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
all right so and then the same thing
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
this is section two of the bill section
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
three of the bill is very similar it
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
takes average final compensation
 
00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
and and does the same thing right so
 
00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:11.930 align:start position:0%
and and does the same thing right so
it's

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah that's okay section three
 
00:58:29.569 --> 00:58:29.579 align:start position:0%
of the bill takes average their house
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
voted two years
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
so it takes average final compensation
 
00:58:34.559 --> 00:58:36.109 align:start position:0%
so it takes average final compensation
and

00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:36.119 --> 00:58:38.510 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
again breaks it up into these five
 
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:44.420 align:start position:0%
groups group one before
 
00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:49.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
middle group
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh two after and and again it's going to
 
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
be changing the date of of this divided
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
right so uh but but I there are some
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
changes by the way and um including to
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
um to group one and I think those are
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
just clean up is that right correct you
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
would say Marty yeah yeah there was one
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
definition you know for for that uh
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
middle tier for a group one in group two
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
that was consistent but there's certain
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
pay types that only apply to group one
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
like uh you know extracurricular um you
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
know teacher development pay and things
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
that are only specific to group two like
 
00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:36.059 align:start position:0%
detail pay So when you buy for Kate the
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
definition of earnable comp for group
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
one and group two you want to take the
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
group two references out of the group
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
but as far as I can tell
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
no they're not trying to do substantive
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
changes here right they're just trying
 
00:59:57.530 --> 00:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
to kind of set up a structure that
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
now let's get to period to section four
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.829 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:41.530 align:start position:0%
it
um

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:41.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:53.030 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
so this is the section
 
01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
so this is the section
um

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.289 align:start position:0%
um
that

01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
says that for certain
 
01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:16.789 align:start position:0%
says that for certain
um

01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
for for certain
 
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.170 align:start position:0%
for for certain
um

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:20.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
it starts to add age into here right so
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
um for group two members who are vested
 
01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:30.650 align:start position:0%
um for group two members who are vested
before

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
um so we're making a group here who are
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.359 --> 01:01:44.450 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
so I guess we're just repeating actually
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
we're repeating the section of law that
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
does the percentages right so
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
um yeah so that's right so this is um
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
four is doing the same thing for the the
 
01:01:58.559 --> 01:02:00.230 align:start position:0%
four is doing the same thing for the the
uh

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
we start out with the group twos right
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
group two is best before one one
 
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:08.390 align:start position:0%
group two is best before one one
uh

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
13 from 12 right
 
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.010 align:start position:0%
13 from 12 right
and

01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
um then we make another section
 
01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:20.049 align:start position:0%
um then we make another section
for

01:02:20.049 --> 01:02:20.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
so this is where the the percentages
 
01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
this is the section where the the two
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
and a half percent lives
 
01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:28.210 align:start position:0%
and a half percent lives
right

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:28.220 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
also representative the minimum age in
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
service requirements are all in that
 
01:02:38.410 --> 01:02:38.420 align:start position:0%
um 100 A5 section two it's it's um
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
what was added was a transition table
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
for those members back in 2011 so
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
um you know where the when the as the
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
multiplier change the minimum age and
 
01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
service each went up a year you know
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
sort of on a ladder so that this is
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
moving people off the ladder is that
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
correct would you call it that Steve
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's an annual transition of
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
people back to the conditions in which
 
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
they were hired originally right okay so
 
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.030 align:start position:0%
they were hired originally right okay so
um

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
so this is where the two and a half
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
percent is previously it was that you
 
01:03:16.609 --> 01:03:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.789 align:start position:0%
 
Plus

01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:30.839 --> 01:03:31.549 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:33.710 align:start position:0%
um
or

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.329 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:47.339 --> 01:03:49.609 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.410 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
um there's a Year's criteria of when you
 
01:04:13.569 --> 01:04:13.579 align:start position:0%
can retire okay and it also has the the
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent stop and it it
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
makes a second a second section for
 
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
makes a second a second section for
um

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
or other other numbers of years okay
 
01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:30.710 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
but anyways this is the one where this
 
01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
multiplier is spelled out right so
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
um this is the one where there's a 2.1
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
percent there's a two percent
 
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.109 align:start position:0%
percent there's a two percent
Etc

01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:46.789 align:start position:0%
Etc
right

01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:48.410 align:start position:0%
right
um

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.799 --> 01:04:54.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
but the the bulk of the action of the
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
bill seems to be in the in the right in
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
the following section
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
so all right so
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
this is just again it's kind of
 
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
repeating current law right with the one
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
exception of this
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
but of changing that particular date
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
but the the following sections are where
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
the real work of the bill is done yeah
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay so section five is the one we've
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
already talked about this is the cat
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
right so for the middle group of group
 
01:05:33.359 --> 01:05:35.510 align:start position:0%
right so for the middle group of group
three

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
um it's changing the cap from the
 
01:05:39.059 --> 01:05:40.849 align:start position:0%
um it's changing the cap from the
current

01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:05:43.849 --> 01:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
um 125 120
 
01:05:43.859 --> 01:05:47.630 align:start position:0%
um 125 120
000.

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
okay let's do it all right
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
and it's changing uh
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:03.530 align:start position:0%
the cap
um

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.450 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
let's change the capital 100 and it's
 
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.010 align:start position:0%
let's change the capital 100 and it's
changing

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
um 85 percent
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.319 --> 01:06:20.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.970 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.789 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's under without my Amendment there's
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
another part
 
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
right and without his Amendment which I
 
01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
haven't introduced to the committee well
 
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
we've already accepted it but anyway it
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
should be explained yeah there's also an
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
accelerator in here for this hundred and
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand
 
01:06:48.609 --> 01:06:48.619 align:start position:0%
right so 1.25
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
per year right so so for the for the the
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
top group here for the for the for the
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
group ones two before
 
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
there's just a limit of of a hundred
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
percent of salary
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of what your overall pension
 
01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:08.700 align:start position:0%
can be 100 of your highest gear for the
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
um there's currently
 
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.010 align:start position:0%
um there's currently
um

01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
there's currently the same right the
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
mids and The Afters are currently the
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
same and it's 85 percent of salary and
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
125 000 right whichever is lower the
 
01:07:32.529 --> 01:07:32.539 align:start position:0%
bill splits those out and makes the mids
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
120 uh 125
 
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:39.500 align:start position:0%
000 and a hundred percent of salary and
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
the bill accelerates the 125 percent of
 
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.410 align:start position:0%
the bill accelerates the 125 percent of
salary

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
salary
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
for uh I'm sorry the 125 000 to a higher
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
number over time it representative it
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
also does something else and this is one
 
01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
of the concessions that was added the
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
pension cap did not get instituted until
 
01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:00.049 align:start position:0%
pension cap did not get instituted until
2009.

01:08:00.049 --> 01:08:00.059 align:start position:0%
2009.
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
and as part of the concessions in this
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
bill it is being moved back to 2001
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
prior to 09 there is no pension cap
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
we are putting eight years of people
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
under a cap that they were not
 
01:08:16.249 --> 01:08:16.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:18.299 align:start position:0%
obviously only for those who are not yet
 
01:08:18.299 --> 01:08:19.370 align:start position:0%
obviously only for those who are not yet
retired

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
retired
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.769 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
so is this an area yeah I saw that so so
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
what he's saying is
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
um currently uh members of commence
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
service before 2009 have no cap on their
 
01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:40.259 align:start position:0%
Sal on their pension this is going to
 
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
make it a hundred percent for those
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
before 2001.
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
right no 2011.
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
it says 2001 right it's it's in two
 
01:08:49.679 --> 01:08:51.010 align:start position:0%
it says 2001 right it's it's in two
parts

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:51.020 align:start position:0%
parts
 
01:08:56.209 --> 01:08:56.219 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding before 2001. so if if
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
under this provision in in the 436 as
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
you have it now uh without the amendment
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
um anyone hired
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
um you know on or after July 1 of 2000
 
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2001 is subject to this
 
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
now 125 000 cap folks hired on that date
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
under current law right now their
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
pension could end up being more than 125
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
if if their compensation you know in
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
their service you know allowed that you
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
know the formula under the formula
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
there's no cap in other words right now
 
01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:32.179 align:start position:0%
for anybody who was hired before
 
01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
7109 and not vested by one one of twelve
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay so it pushes the cat back for about
 
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
eight years but this seems like an error
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
right because if they're not
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
um how can you give up something for oh
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
or have attained vested status I see
 
01:09:52.199 --> 01:09:53.809 align:start position:0%
or have attained vested status I see
okay

01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's one of the multiple concessions
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
that exist in 436 but it seems to me
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
you're changing something for somebody
 
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem right again
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's the way the way the bill was
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
constructed there are multiple
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
concessions within the bill to make this
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
more to make this work and that is one
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
of those but we can't ever give back
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
something from somebody who's festive
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
right so this is one of the areas that I
 
01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:24.140 align:start position:0%
think is
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
we can't violate article 23 of the
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
Constitution as well and we did that so
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
if we're going to start imposing rules
 
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.590 align:start position:0%
if we're going to start imposing rules
then

01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
all right let's let's uh let's move on
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
but but what you're saying is so in this
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
particular section the cap is let's just
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
leave it at that the cap is the key part
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
of section five
 
01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:50.219 align:start position:0%
all right now section six is the one
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
that moves all the dates
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
right so what the main thing that's
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
happening in this bill right is that
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
in the table of 1.2 percent 1.1 percent
 
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.189 align:start position:0%
in the table of 1.2 percent 1.1 percent
Etc

01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
the people in this middle group
 
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
over time are moving up the table toward
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
okay right right and
 
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:18.410 align:start position:0%
okay right right and
and

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
they're moving from the the middle group
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
over there right in their way their
 
01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation is into the top
 
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.570 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation is into the top
group

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
right so they're moving from this middle
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
group into the group where instead of a
 
01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
five-year average we now have a
 
01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
three-year average instead of an average
 
01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.209 align:start position:0%
three-year average instead of an average
with

01:11:41.209 --> 01:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:11:41.219 --> 01:11:42.110 align:start position:0%
with
um

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
with limitations I don't even see where
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
I put that
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
um instead of it oh yeah instead of the
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
the base plus cob thing where we limit
 
01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
how much extra you can have over your
 
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
base we move into the area where it's a
 
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
three year average without that
 
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.290 align:start position:0%
three year average without that
limitation

01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
limitation
 
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
right so for people in this group for
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
those that 10-year window of people
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
um we're moving them into the
 
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.750 align:start position:0%
um we're moving them into the
um

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
into the three-year average and without
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
that limitation
 
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
um we're letting them have a vacation
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
and sick pay count as part of their
 
01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:24.500 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
and we're moving them in this table
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
of toward two and a half percent so so
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
at the time they're going to retire they
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
were you know it's done it's done in a
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
phased way right over over a period of
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
time but but typically they will get to
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
the two and a half it's done in a phased
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
way as part of another concession which
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
is now taking someone that was normally
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
hired to work a 20-year career in
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
forcing them to work to a 22-year career
 
01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
yes so it is not a full restoration of
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
their conditions back into the first
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
group there are not on day one putting
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
back the law to its state in 2011.
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's true it's over time
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
pushing the people just in this
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
particular group towards 2011. but it
 
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
also the ones hired after 7 111
 
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.570 align:start position:0%
also the ones hired after 7 111
unchanged

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
unchanged
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
unchanged okay that's right okay
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
all right and I think that's it
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay I would I have defended and I'll
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
continue to defend the legislature's
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
right to modify the pension system for
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
folks that have never been hired and
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's what the seven one of eleven
 
01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
third box is it's folks that didn't
 
01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.110 align:start position:0%
third box is it's folks that didn't
exist

01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't address those folks IT
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
addresses the folks that were hired
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
under a different condition and then had
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
that modified on them right after they
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
were employed but the point is
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
all right now we can start talking about
 
01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
but the financial aspect has several
 
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.830 align:start position:0%
but the financial aspect has several
pieces

01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
right one is
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
this one the two and a half per the two
 
01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:13.940 align:start position:0%
percent moving to two and a half percent
 
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
right but there's also those
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
the The Five-Year average moving to
 
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:21.830 align:start position:0%
the The Five-Year average moving to
three

01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
the extras vacation sick Etc moving to
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
the old uh formula
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
right so those are all separate pieces
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
right and you could
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
kind of have the bill structure as messy
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
um with just some of the pieces and not
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.570 --> 01:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay I see representative Sweeney has a
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
question or a thought I have a thought
 
01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%

01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you representative
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
Pearson and Marty for giving us kind of
 
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
a full picture of what we currently have
 
01:15:14.689 --> 01:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
in the system and what 436 attempted to
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
do uh it is our last day for the for our
 
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
division to put together the budget so I
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
want to propose an amendment to house
 
01:15:27.169 --> 01:15:27.179 align:start position:0%
bill 2. that can cover areas if that's
 
01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
the right time to do so or if we want
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
more discussion yeah absolutely I do
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
have a quick question for uh
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
our LBA staff did you ever hear back
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner of dra as far as
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
if we move up the repeal of the phasing
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
out of the IND tax yes and I have a
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
handout for that would you like me to
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
pass that out yeah thanks
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
then representative Sweeney will take up
 
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
a couple of members who requested a
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
quick break so we'll take a 10 minute
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
break okay
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
sorry representative

01:16:16.920 --> 01:35:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
that we're subsequently we'll call the
 
01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.250 align:start position:0%
that we're subsequently we'll call the
division

01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:40.750 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire everybody here
 
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:49.910 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
back

01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
so we started a little discussion
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
earlier and I know representative
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
Sweeney would like to offer a motion
 
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
Chairman's in the uh seeking a grand
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
compromise that can really tackle a lot
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
of the issues that we're facing uh the
 
01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
legislature right now I want to move
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
that we roll into House Bill 2 for the
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
budget uh the amendment amended version
 
01:36:18.410 --> 01:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
of 436 from Friday 0891h
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
but I also want to make a a modification
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
where the state picks up the subdivision
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
costs that was increased by the bill and
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
I also want to in the same motion adopt
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
the provisions of Amendment
 
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
1022h which restored the Communication
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
Service tax and sped up the repeal of
 
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividend Stacks we have
 
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
the analysis uh and I'd like to speak to
 
01:36:46.129 --> 01:36:46.139 align:start position:0%
my mother yeah absolutely I'll second
 
01:36:46.139 --> 01:36:47.090 align:start position:0%
my mother yeah absolutely I'll second
year

01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:36:49.490 --> 01:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh we just got the
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
analysis from the LBA on what the latter
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
part of my motion would do by restoring
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Communication Service tax in the
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
budget and speeding up the repeal of the
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
interested dividends tax to end uh by
 
01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
this biennium
 
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and it actually produces relatively a
 
01:37:08.209 --> 01:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
40 million dollar gain for the State of
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh in doing so which would
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
provide the funds uh in my recollection
 
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
to fund the elements of 436 that would
 
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
be rolling into the budget along with
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
the uh provision that we pick up the
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
slack that was going to be sent to the
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities around six million
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
dollars or so in 436 to the subdivision
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
so that's my one motion to do all of
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
that in one motion so we can have a good
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
compromise and get good policy done for
 
01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
the uh for the budget process and for
 
01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
comments from the division
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative camberells thank you Mr
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
chair yes I think that that's a very uh
 
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
reasonable proposal and that it's a
 
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
win-win for everybody so I would like to
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
uh I would be voting yes on that
 
01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate what you're what
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
um I would be happy to vote for this if
 
01:38:11.209 --> 01:38:11.219 align:start position:0%
it was just pulling back the CST but I
 
01:38:15.010 --> 01:38:15.020 align:start position:0%
can't support the the uh up whatever
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
increasing the um
 
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
phase out of the IND I just I feel like
 
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
we could do this and just pull back the
 
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.669 align:start position:0%
we could do this and just pull back the
CST

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
01:38:33.770 --> 01:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
all along I've had some reservations
 
01:38:38.689 --> 01:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
about 4 36. mainly because we're relying
 
01:38:38.699 --> 01:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
about 4 36. mainly because we're relying
on

01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
the future legislators
 
01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
to fund it
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
but if we restore the communications tax
 
01:38:53.050 --> 01:38:53.060 align:start position:0%
and dedicate that to the funding of it
 
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.450 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
chairman

01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:06.890 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:10.129 --> 01:39:10.139 align:start position:0%
you know I will vote for this
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
um but I it's not my preference
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and there's in for a couple of
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
different based on details so let me ask
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
Marty first
 
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.030 align:start position:0%
Marty first
um

01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.689 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:26.699 --> 01:39:27.410 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
let me see how I can put this
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
we we don't know
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
so so in my mind the house bill 436 does
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
these four things right that we talked
 
01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.270 align:start position:0%
these four things right that we talked
about

01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
changes the percentage from two point
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
whatever to 2.5 over time
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
changes the Caps from 85 percent to 100
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay change is the AFC com compilation
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
calculation and the earnable
 
01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
compensation calculation okay
 
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
in particular the first two I think are
 
01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:07.380 align:start position:0%
reasonable okay
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
um but those over there the changes in
 
01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:12.470 align:start position:0%
um but those over there the changes in
in

01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
um uh earnable compensation and average
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
final compensation
 
01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
seemed to me to be anti-spiking things
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we are weakening right they were
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
they were anti-spiking
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
um Provisions that that this bill
 
01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
weakens so that spiking can occur more
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
spiking whatever
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
um can occur and and they're in two
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
different ways right as as shown over
 
01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.649 align:start position:0%
different ways right as as shown over
there

01:40:45.649 --> 01:40:45.659 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
um and secondly the the provisions that
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
were done last year in
 
01:40:53.219 --> 01:40:54.169 align:start position:0%
were done last year in
um

01:40:54.169 --> 01:40:54.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1587 I don't think are
 
01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.750 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1587 I don't think are
unreasonable

01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
01:41:04.209 --> 01:41:04.219 align:start position:0%
and we're very likely to get to get uh
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
from the from the group after right in
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
the in the um average final compensation
 
01:41:10.199 --> 01:41:12.350 align:start position:0%
the in the um average final compensation
calculation

01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
calculation
 
01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
as I understand House Bill 1587 was
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
originally they shaved a little bit of
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
money last year by carving out that
 
01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:21.470 align:start position:0%
money last year by carving out that
group

01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:24.020 align:start position:0%
but it's but it's not really reasonable
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
to to change to make this big change for
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
this group and not do something for them
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
too in my mind right and
 
01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.570 align:start position:0%
too in my mind right and
um

01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:39.410 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't like those aspects of
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
it I don't like the aspects of
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
um leaving alone the current people
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
because these are these are people we're
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
trying to hire under characteristics
 
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
very different than than these are
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
people that are already working Etc
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
um it's it's gonna make it in my mind
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
higher harder to hire
 
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
if we if we don't improve benefits if
 
01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
we're improving benefit if we're in the
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
business of improving benefits we should
 
01:42:15.649 --> 01:42:15.659 align:start position:0%
do it for people who are trying to hire
 
01:42:19.609 --> 01:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
now to some extent then then just the
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
people who are already working and and
 
01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
and the thing is if we wait let's say we
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
do this 10 years from now right it's
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
that much more expensive because we
 
01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
haven't been saving all along so it's
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
those two areas that I'm that I have
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:41.090 --> 01:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
represents Sweeney further comment thank
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative for for supporting the
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
the motion I mean I'm not in
 
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
disagreement that we we need to find a
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
solution for the the new hires and for
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
the Post 2011 hires
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
um that's sort of in that Gap that were
 
01:42:59.209 --> 01:42:59.219 align:start position:0%
hired and recruited without the promise
 
01:43:03.649 --> 01:43:03.659 align:start position:0%
uh in place that 436 seeks to restore
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to work on other
 
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
legislation but I think for for the
 
01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
budget and for what we can do today this
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
is a this is a good compromise that
 
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
everyone can point to and see something
 
01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
they like see something they don't like
 
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
if we were to each write a budget that
 
01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:20.460 align:start position:0%
we wanted it'd be 400 separate documents
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think this is uh I I'm
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
in agreement with with your comments on
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
on making it better for new hires and
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
retaining but I think striking this deal
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
today is a good move for the state so
 
01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
any further follow-up from members of
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
the division
 
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
well I would like to comment I'm in
 
01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
complete support of this amendment I
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Sweeney for
 
01:43:49.850 --> 01:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
working with me and others
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
to get to a place I think that works and
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
corrects a wrong that was done over a
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
decade ago
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it actually gives us a more positive
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
balance as we go towards the final
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
stages of the budget
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
there has been some concern about uh
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
moving the IND repeal up that will be a
 
01:44:11.689 --> 01:44:11.699 align:start position:0%
decision for the next legislature to
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
deal with we have no idea what's going
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
on in two years we don't have a lot of
 
01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
idea what may be going on tomorrow but I
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
think this is a very good move I think
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's a good compromise and I hope my
 
01:44:26.689 --> 01:44:26.699 align:start position:0%
colleagues support it thank you when the
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
clerk is ready I wish oh I'm sorry
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt yeah I just want
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
to say that there's there's more that
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
could be done for for anybody the
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
situation here is what made Difficult by
 
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
the by the budgetary process that we're
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
going through and the changes that we're
 
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
going to have to make in terms of having
 
01:44:52.090 --> 01:44:52.100 align:start position:0%
a a satisfactory solution to the budget
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
budget process in terms of uh House Bill
 
01:44:55.739 --> 01:44:57.530 align:start position:0%
budget process in terms of uh House Bill
436

01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
436
 
01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:58.310 align:start position:0%
436
um

01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
I agree that we need to do something
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
about the people the new the new hires
 
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh but of course the people that have
 
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
been with us for all these years uh have
 
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
been suffering with it for for a long
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
time and if it if it means that we have
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
to take a little more time to to make a
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
solution for the new hires I think that
 
01:45:22.250 --> 01:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
in this situation we have to do that so
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:30.179 align:start position:0%
Melissa and Mr Hoffman obviously we
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
don't have an amendment number yet but I
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
hope that the motion was clear so we
 
01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
could put something together for us to
 
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
look at in black and white but we can
 
01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
certainly vote on representative
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
Sweeney's motion so it's
 
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire I remember what I
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask Marty so Marty in the in
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
the house the fiscal note for House Bill
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
436 we are lowering the unfunded
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
liability by 22.7 million right yeah is
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
that happening
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of 10 years or is it now or
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
how does that the when the when the
 
01:46:08.159 --> 01:46:09.410 align:start position:0%
how does that the when the when the
actuary

01:46:09.410 --> 01:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
actuary
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
um projects the unfunded liability they
 
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
back it into present value of dollars so
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
that you know the the liability
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
increases in in today is If You Paid It
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
Up Front it's it's X
 
01:46:25.810 --> 01:46:25.820 align:start position:0%
having a 25 million dollar
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation over a 10-year period I
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
think in the original note the actuary
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
estimated the present value of that
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
recurring appropriation as 189.7 billion
 
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
and again in today's dollars so
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
um with Representatives Pearson's change
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
in 0891
 
01:46:46.129 --> 01:46:46.139 align:start position:0%
um the the 25 million appropriation over
 
01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
um does has a has a positive impact it
 
01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
reduces it's that's overpaying the
 
01:46:55.729 --> 01:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
liability so essentially you're but
 
01:46:58.250 --> 01:46:58.260 align:start position:0%
there is you know probably about 1.4
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
billion on the group two
 
01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:02.100 align:start position:0%
um in the of the the total unfunded so
 
01:47:04.450 --> 01:47:04.460 align:start position:0%
you're paying that down earlier in that
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
22.7 million it's recognized over 20
 
01:47:10.129 --> 01:47:10.139 align:start position:0%
years but it's lowering the the employer
 
01:47:12.649 --> 01:47:12.659 align:start position:0%
rate increase
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's you know it's not like the
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
money's going nowhere I mean it's it's
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
used anything over funding the bill
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
itself is going towards existing
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
unfunded which will you know lower the
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
rates for everyone so that lowered the
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh the employer rate increase from two
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
point something to 1.6 or whatever is in
 
01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note yes yeah
 
01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
so to go to from 1.6 to 0 we have to
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
extra pay
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
how much well I the projection
 
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
um you know this is based on projected
 
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
payroll for fiscal 26. it's on this it
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
was part of the document that LBA put
 
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
together for you yesterday the last page
 
01:47:55.609 --> 01:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
um which is something I I sent over for
 
01:47:58.430 --> 01:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
them it showed under the
 
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
version of hb436 is adopted by the house
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
the employer contributions in 26 would
 
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.310 align:start position:0%
the employer contributions in 26 would
be

01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
14.38 million and with this amendment
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
that goes down to 9.1 and it's all
 
01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
normal cost there's no unfunded cost
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
associated with that so that
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
um you know so that so that amendment in
 
01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
and of itself by
 
01:48:24.169 --> 01:48:24.179 align:start position:0%
taking the escalator off of that
 
01:48:27.530 --> 01:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
um 125 000 maximum benefit limit reduce
 
01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
the annual cost in 26 by over 5 million
 
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:32.330 align:start position:0%
the annual cost in 26 by over 5 million
dollars

01:48:32.330 --> 01:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay so so yeah so you think this extra
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
what did we say six or something yeah
 
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
is enough
 
01:48:43.189 --> 01:48:43.199 align:start position:0%
to change that one point
 
01:48:45.890 --> 01:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
what was this is the restoring that
 
01:48:48.609 --> 01:48:48.619 align:start position:0%
other Communications tax
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
he wanted to just spend just put into
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
the retirement says house fill 50 style
 
01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:57.719 align:start position:0%
I guess but just for group twos the
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
group two unfunded liability
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
um like an extra six or so six or seven
 
01:49:05.689 --> 01:49:05.699 align:start position:0%
in order to get that one point seven
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
if I could help here this is the
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
document that was prepared for us by the
 
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
LBA which shows the impact of 436 as
 
01:49:19.689 --> 01:49:19.699 align:start position:0%
amended with
 
01:49:24.590 --> 01:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
0891h and the the back page the total
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
impact was about six million dollars in
 
01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:43.990 align:start position:0%
impact was about six million dollars in
change

01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.169 --> 01:49:48.179 align:start position:0%
yeah representative grassy any thoughts
 
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
yes um Mr chairman
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
um this is you know I'm I I want to I
 
01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
want to support this but I think I've
 
01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
sort of got a knife to my neck right now
 
01:50:00.649 --> 01:50:00.659 align:start position:0%
because what we've done is I hear the
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
complaints about how we don't have
 
01:50:03.649 --> 01:50:03.659 align:start position:0%
enough money to do things we've got
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
ourselves into a big hole here
 
01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
and when we take the IND out
 
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
um you know accelerate that I think what
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing here in this amendment is
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
asking for a bigger shovel so we can
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
keep digging a bigger hole we've
 
01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
listened to these problems that we have
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
with deficits and funds we have an
 
01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:22.739 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address them and we're
 
01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
ignoring that but because we have to
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
find a tax cut someplace and I think
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
that the money the numbers that we see
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
here that for the future we're basically
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
digging that hole deeper so that future
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
legislations legislatures are going to
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
be even in more trouble as far as trying
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
able to fund programs such as this
 
01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:44.699 align:start position:0%
I will vote for this bill
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
but I will not support and if there's
 
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
any effort to take the interest in
 
01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
dividends tax acceleration out I will
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
support that because I think it's this
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
is the wrong thing to do
 
01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
but this is a good bill and we need to
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
get it passed
 
01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative grassy uh
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
seeing no further comments if the clerk
 
01:51:07.010 --> 01:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
is ready to call a roll and again our
 
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
lva folks will be getting the black and
 
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
white version of this to us once we vote
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
Yes Melissa okay
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
clarify just to make sure we're doing
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment correct you want to
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
terminally fund the bill essentially so
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
not having any cost to the municipality
 
01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
as it is right now where it has an
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
additional 7.5 million costs two minute
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
you to the municipalities each year you
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
want to terminally fund that for the
 
01:51:31.070 --> 01:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
state correct
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks Melissa anything Mr
 
01:51:33.719 --> 01:51:35.149 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks Melissa anything Mr
Kaufman

01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
Kaufman
 
01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
thanks okay if the clerk is ready to
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
please call I just need to clarify in my
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
own mind so we have HB 436 we have this
 
01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:45.609 align:start position:0%
own mind so we have HB 436 we have this
amendment

01:51:45.609 --> 01:51:45.619 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
0891h that we adopted last Friday last
 
01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
Friday and what this amendment this um
 
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
1022h does is it moves 436 into HB 2 or
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
no sorry so my motion was to take 436 as
 
01:52:08.770 --> 01:52:08.780 align:start position:0%
amended on Friday put it into hp2 take
 
01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
1022h put that into hb2 and restore and
 
01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
and absorb the municipal and political
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
subdivision costs of 436 into the budget
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
so it's really three things in that one
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
motion uh in the in the seeking of a
 
01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.450 align:start position:0%
motion uh in the in the seeking of a
compromise

01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:52:28.729 --> 01:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Sweeney
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
are you all set
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
could there be any interest in just
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
splitting up the motion and just having
 
01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:38.699 align:start position:0%
one relating to 436 as amended and not
 
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
including your motion on the pain
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to make this motion and have
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
this vote on this motion first and then
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
no problem depending on it we can we can
 
01:52:51.169 --> 01:52:51.179 align:start position:0%
I just was asking it's an important
 
01:52:51.179 --> 01:52:52.609 align:start position:0%
I just was asking it's an important
point

01:52:52.609 --> 01:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
yes Marty just just as as a as a caviar
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
I just would just want to mention you
 
01:52:59.590 --> 01:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
know when we're talking about future
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
retirement costs there are a lot of
 
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
actual assumptions that go into that you
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
know those assumptions may be monitored
 
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know maybe modified due to cause
 
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
over time if if uh circumstances change
 
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
so I I I I understand representative
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
sweetie's intention to terminally fund
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
the bill going forward but
 
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
um the the 26 employer rate increase
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
um you know that's based on the payroll
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
in 26 and then the the in our rates are
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
assessed as a percentage of covered
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
payroll so the payroll is going to grow
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
every year at a certain amount and I
 
01:53:37.129 --> 01:53:37.139 align:start position:0%
don't know what you know the the tax
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
changes and the other Amendment you know
 
01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
what the what the future Revenue
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
projections are for that what I'm saying
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
is you may be terminally funding it you
 
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
know but that may change over time just
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know you may be over funding it you
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
know or you know type of thing but it's
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
like what aren't you decide so they
 
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
couldn't can't guarantee terminally
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
funding because
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
things may change you know over time
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
yeah as you know as you've seen in the
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
past the legislature next time may do
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
something totally different we can only
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
tie our hands we can't tie theirs yeah
 
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire yeah so I'm worried
 
01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
that the number we have on this page the
 
01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:16.139 align:start position:0%
six million dollars that's a one-year
 
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
number not a terminal number is that
 
01:54:21.050 --> 01:54:21.060 align:start position:0%
correct Mark that's correct yeah
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the employer projected
 
01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
employer rate increase in fiscal 26. you
 
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
know and that that percent of pay that
 
01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
1.6 a 1.67 would be you know projected
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
to be stable over you know the next 10
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
20 years but as payroll grows you're
 
01:54:40.729 --> 01:54:40.739 align:start position:0%
you're it's you know in actual dollars
 
01:54:42.169 --> 01:54:42.179 align:start position:0%
it's going to be more but as a percent
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the covered payroll you know that
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
that you know will be be flatter so if
 
01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:47.570 align:start position:0%
that you know will be be flatter so if
you

01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
you know if you're paying 10 of a
 
01:54:51.410 --> 01:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars and then you're paying
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
10 of 2 million dollars you know you're
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
paying 200 100 000 more 10 years from
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
now you know that's just you know it's
 
01:54:59.810 --> 01:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's how it goes but you know with
 
01:55:02.090 --> 01:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
inflation and other things
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's not the same because you you know
 
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
200 000 isn't worth 100 000 is now yeah
 
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:08.340 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of
 
01:55:10.850 --> 01:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
but present value and future value
 
01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
issues baked into that math but doesn't
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
the words terminally Fund in this motion
 
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
change the six million dollars to 60
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars today yes
 
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm kind of kind of digging a
 
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
little deeper into some of the math that
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm you know comfortable kind of
 
01:55:35.390 --> 01:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
guessing at at least without a pen and
 
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
an envelope in front of me
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know but but the employer rate
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
increase isn't a one-year increase you
 
01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
know that's that's you know that that's
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
the point you know that basically the
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
the 1.68 and 1.67 is the cost of the
 
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
additional benefits gained by the middle
 
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
tier as a result of this bill for their
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
service going forward up until they
 
01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:01.189 align:start position:0%
service going forward up until they
retire

01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
retire
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's you know there's no
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's not the unfunded piece of it that
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's covered plus with the 25 million
 
01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
so this is this is future accruals you
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
know if you were funding it on a
 
01:56:13.370 --> 01:56:13.380 align:start position:0%
year-over-year basis how much do we need
 
01:56:15.709 --> 01:56:15.719 align:start position:0%
to put aside for this member next year
 
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
the rate should be X so um you know it's
 
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's two different things
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
and the normal cost is dependent on you
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
know all the assumptions and and so the
 
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
intent of terminally funding it today is
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
you're temporarily finding it today
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
based on current assumptions and that
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine and that's what the
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
legislature's always done
 
01:56:36.649 --> 01:56:36.659 align:start position:0%
um so so that's not let me use the
 
01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
analogy of House Bill 571. 571 was
 
01:56:43.149 --> 01:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
terminally funded at 84 million dollars
 
01:56:47.689 --> 01:56:47.699 align:start position:0%
yeah for a benefit that was roughly
 
01:56:50.350 --> 01:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
eight or nine million dollars per year
 
01:56:53.530 --> 01:56:53.540 align:start position:0%
right yeah for for that particular group
 
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
so so my point is the bet the yearly
 
01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
benefit was eight or nine the terminally
 
01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
funded cost was 80 four yes yeah so so
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
therefore representative Sweeney I would
 
01:57:08.209 --> 01:57:08.219 align:start position:0%
hope from your motion we could remove
 
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
terminally funded and make it a fixed
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
amount so therefore it's easier to
 
01:57:14.930 --> 01:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
calculate and we know what we're getting
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
into sorry and and for clarity my my
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
intent was to fund it within this budget
 
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
that we're building not future year like
 
01:57:26.089 --> 01:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
not fund the future years in this budget
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
just the the sixth or the Six Million
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the 1.2 million to
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
the counties so all the political
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions I want to fund that in this
 
01:57:39.890 --> 01:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
budget not terminally for the next 10
 
01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:41.510 align:start position:0%
budget not terminally for the next 10
years

01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
at once right but
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
it's not going to zero out the one point
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
something percent forever that's the
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
point you see what I mean it's a much
 
01:57:54.169 --> 01:57:54.179 align:start position:0%
bigger number
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
today to do that then I think you
 
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
anticipate I I want to make sure that we
 
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
are covering the political subdivision
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
costs of 436
 
01:58:07.129 --> 01:58:07.139 align:start position:0%
within this budget for the net for the
 
01:58:08.689 --> 01:58:08.699 align:start position:0%
two budget fiscal years that we're
 
01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
dealing with okay just for these two
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
years just for these two years and I and
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
not for forever correct I want to be
 
01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
clear on that okay so that's more like a
 
01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.219 align:start position:0%
12 million for example I think sure yes
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
all right are we clear about that yeah
 
01:58:25.729 --> 01:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.739 --> 01:58:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
just because we need to be crystal clear
 
01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:34.490 align:start position:0%
just because we need to be crystal clear
here

01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask uh representative
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
Sweeney to restate his motion absolutely
 
01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
I am moving to adopt House Bill 436 as
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
amended by zero eight nine one H into
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
hb2 with uh for the fiscal years 24 and
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
25 the state absorbing the cost of the
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities in 436 and adopting the
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
provisions of amendment
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
1022h to House Bill 2 to speed up the
 
01:59:05.450 --> 01:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
phase out of the interest of dividends
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
tax and restore the Communication
 
01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
the Motions been made in second did you
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
have any further comment does anybody
 
01:59:21.649 --> 01:59:21.659 align:start position:0%
have so I just need to say that I
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate the what you're trying to do
 
01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate that you're trying
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
to cover the municipalities I appreciate
 
01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:29.270 align:start position:0%
to cover the municipalities I appreciate
everything

01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
I have a real problem with um having the
 
01:59:35.930 --> 01:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
phase out of the IND moved up by two
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
years we have a real concern about
 
01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
revenues and um you know I don't want
 
01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
anybody here to think that I'm not in
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
support of HB 436 but it's the this
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
particular funding mechanism if it
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have the IND in it and we worked
 
01:59:55.729 --> 01:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
out something else I would vote for it
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to clarify why I will
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
be voting against the uh Amendment thank
 
02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:05.589 align:start position:0%
be voting against the uh Amendment thank
you

02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I would just like
 
02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
to say for the record that if it went
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
the way that representative evil would
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:20.209 --> 02:00:20.219 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:00:23.209 --> 02:00:23.219 align:start position:0%
now seeing no further questions or
 
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
comments when the clerk is ready please
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
call the rule okay so
 
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
um this is an ought to pass
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
motion on amendment 10 22 h
 
02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:36.770 align:start position:0%
motion on amendment 10 22 h
right

02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:38.089 align:start position:0%
right
and

02:00:38.089 --> 02:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:40.330 --> 02:00:40.340 align:start position:0%
ants rolling 4 30.
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay all right so let's see how should
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
we do that so there's no there's yeah
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
there's no specific amendment number yet
 
02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:50.219 align:start position:0%
what will happen is the LBA will get
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
this together and we will have a
 
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
specific amendment number all right all
 
02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
right so we're going to vote on rolling
 
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
HB 436 into hb2 as amended the other day
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
by whatever that was oh one eight nine H
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%

reconvene at one o'clock we'll take up
 
02:01:57.649 --> 02:01:57.659 align:start position:0%
571 that's one of our big issues on our

because

02:04:52.070 --> 02:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:58.990 align:start position:0%

02:06:27.890 --> 02:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
you know what my Marvel's on this thing
 
02:06:28.729 --> 02:06:28.739 align:start position:0%
you know that I was going to benefit
 
02:06:28.739 --> 02:06:36.649 align:start position:0%
you know that I was going to benefit
yeah

02:06:36.649 --> 02:06:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.659 --> 03:27:18.170 align:start position:0%
 
inspiring

03:27:20.809 --> 03:27:20.819 align:start position:0%
bigger than this one yes what does his
 
03:27:22.790 --> 03:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
desk at home look like representative
 
03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
McGuire it's it's sort of like yours but
 
03:27:26.510 --> 03:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
more so
 
03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:27.889 align:start position:0%
more so
um

03:27:27.889 --> 03:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:37.130 --> 03:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.729 --> 03:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
so we'll take up 571 first try to
 
03:27:41.929 --> 03:27:41.939 align:start position:0%
dispense with that I believe
 
03:27:43.790 --> 03:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has an amendment
 
03:27:48.530 --> 03:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:51.050 --> 03:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
Melissa could you I see you've got a
 
03:27:53.090 --> 03:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
good stack you just I guess re-hand out
 
03:27:57.950 --> 03:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:57.960 --> 03:28:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:00.600 --> 03:28:08.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:28:08.210 --> 03:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:08.220 --> 03:28:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:27.229 --> 03:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
are these
 
03:28:34.010 --> 03:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
all right representative McGuire I see
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:59.760 --> 03:29:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:29:11.110 --> 03:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.170 --> 03:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna begin our deliberations
 
03:29:18.050 --> 03:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
on representative McGuire's he's got two
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
amendments I'm not sure which one he
 
03:29:21.610 --> 03:29:21.620 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to first but
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:26.870 --> 03:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:29:30.830 --> 03:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
um I believe let's let's start with well
 
03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
maybe I was just explain what the two
 
03:29:36.410 --> 03:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
are they're quite similar so if if you
 
03:29:36.420 --> 03:29:37.670 align:start position:0%
are they're quite similar so if if you
recall

03:29:37.670 --> 03:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
recall
 
03:29:44.870 --> 03:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 571 is a cola for group
 
03:29:49.130 --> 03:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
two retirees who are retired 10 years or
 
03:29:49.140 --> 03:29:50.269 align:start position:0%
two retirees who are retired 10 years or
more

03:29:50.269 --> 03:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:29:54.110 --> 03:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
and it has two steps in it one is the 10
 
03:29:58.849 --> 03:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
to 19 group and one is the 20 plus group
 
03:30:01.550 --> 03:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
and the way it currently is is a five
 
03:30:04.809 --> 03:30:04.819 align:start position:0%
percent increase for the 10 to 19 group
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
and a 10 increase for the 20 plus group
 
03:30:08.399 --> 03:30:10.429 align:start position:0%
and a 10 increase for the 20 plus group
so

03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:12.889 --> 03:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
um and it's also a permanent Cola so
 
03:30:17.090 --> 03:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
therefore it's uh the total cost is
 
03:30:19.969 --> 03:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
quite high it's 84 million
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so both of these bills uh make it a
 
03:30:26.690 --> 03:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
one-time payment
 
03:30:26.700 --> 03:30:27.650 align:start position:0%
one-time payment
um

03:30:27.650 --> 03:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:27.660 --> 03:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:34.429 --> 03:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
um they also put in a cap so that total
 
03:30:37.849 --> 03:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
um uh pension plus the supplement will
 
03:30:41.690 --> 03:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
not exceed a hundred thousand dollars
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and they the the simpler of the two
 
03:30:50.690 --> 03:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
bills is uh 1097 H and that one simply
 
03:30:54.050 --> 03:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
in the first group the 10 to 19 group
 
03:30:57.590 --> 03:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
the supplement is two thousand dollars
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
and in the 20 plus group the supplement
 
03:31:02.929 --> 03:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
is three thousand dollars
 
03:31:02.939 --> 03:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
is three thousand dollars
okay

03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:31:06.889 --> 03:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
in the other Amendment
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
the uh 1100h
 
03:31:13.309 --> 03:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
so with the same thing in the 20 plus
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
group The the supplement is three
 
03:31:20.210 --> 03:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars but in the 10 to 19
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
group the supplement is a ramp so it it
 
03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
starts for 10 years
 
03:31:31.610 --> 03:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
um 10 years uh retired would be eleven
 
03:31:34.910 --> 03:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars 11 years retired would
 
03:31:37.130 --> 03:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
be thirteen hundred dollars 12 years
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
retired fifteen hundred dollars and so
 
03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
on so it ramps up to the hit three
 
03:31:45.229 --> 03:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
thousand so there's no big step you know
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's not like somebody who's retired
 
03:31:54.170 --> 03:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
um 19 years and and the uh and a half
 
03:31:56.330 --> 03:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
compared to somebody who's retired 20
 
03:31:56.340 --> 03:31:57.250 align:start position:0%
compared to somebody who's retired 20
years

03:31:57.250 --> 03:31:57.260 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:32:00.170 --> 03:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
there's not a a giant difference there
 
03:32:02.690 --> 03:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's more of a smooth smooth ramp
 
03:32:04.010 --> 03:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would prefer the smooth
 
03:32:07.729 --> 03:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
ramp type and that is so I'll move house
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill I'll move Amendment 1100h
 
03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
I'll second it for discussion but I did
 
03:32:15.650 --> 03:32:15.660 align:start position:0%
have a question the financial impact
 
03:32:17.389 --> 03:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
03:32:20.210 --> 03:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I don't know specific the
 
03:32:21.889 --> 03:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
one part of the bill that I don't know
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
is the cap on a hundred thousand dollars
 
03:32:26.990 --> 03:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how that would
 
03:32:27.000 --> 03:32:28.429 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how that would
affect

03:32:28.429 --> 03:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
affect
 
03:32:31.610 --> 03:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
um the total but it's roughly nine
 
03:32:34.010 --> 03:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:32:36.229 --> 03:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
um for the for the one one-time payment
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
because we have an exact number of the
 
03:32:42.530 --> 03:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
people in the first in in the 10 to 19
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
and 20 plus and if you multiply those by
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
three thousand and two thousand you get
 
03:32:51.410 --> 03:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
roughly nine million so your Amendment
 
03:32:55.130 --> 03:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
for identified as Eleven Hundred is
 
03:32:56.929 --> 03:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
roughly 9 million is that what you're
 
03:32:59.210 --> 03:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
saying yes it may be slightly less
 
03:33:01.750 --> 03:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't know how many retirees
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
hit the hundred thousand dollar cap I
 
03:33:06.769 --> 03:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
expect it's very tiny it's a very small
 
03:33:08.750 --> 03:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
number thank you
 
03:33:12.229 --> 03:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
questions from members of the division
 
03:33:18.410 --> 03:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:21.650 --> 03:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
that was good A lot of people like to do
 
03:33:21.660 --> 03:33:22.610 align:start position:0%
that was good A lot of people like to do
that

03:33:22.610 --> 03:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:33:22.620 --> 03:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:25.670 --> 03:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
I've been reading these amendments that
 
03:33:27.710 --> 03:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
they they look the same tell me how how
 
03:33:29.929 --> 03:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
they're different as yeah
 
03:33:32.929 --> 03:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
so they're different in section
 
03:33:38.990 --> 03:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
um one one a okay so notice that in
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1097 H the amount of the
 
03:33:44.210 --> 03:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
supplemental allowance shall be two
 
03:33:46.370 --> 03:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
03:33:46.380 --> 03:33:47.990 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
okay

03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:50.450 --> 03:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
in in the other one the amount of the
 
03:33:52.490 --> 03:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
supplemental allowance shall be two
 
03:33:54.349 --> 03:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars times number of years
 
03:33:57.050 --> 03:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
since retirement date minus nine hundred
 
03:33:59.210 --> 03:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
dollars that's the difference okay so
 
03:34:01.729 --> 03:34:01.739 align:start position:0%
one has a little calculation the other
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
one has a fixed flat you know but but
 
03:34:07.969 --> 03:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
the calculation creates a a slope where
 
03:34:10.370 --> 03:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
the two thousands in the middle right
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
then it goes from one thousand up to
 
03:34:18.429 --> 03:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:21.530 --> 03:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wondered how you picked 900
 
03:34:21.540 --> 03:34:24.650 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wondered how you picked 900
dollars

03:34:24.650 --> 03:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
well I just picked
 
03:34:30.110 --> 03:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
I sort of from the other the reason I
 
03:34:31.849 --> 03:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
picked two for the other Bill we started
 
03:34:34.370 --> 03:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
with the for the simpler Bill the two
 
03:34:37.490 --> 03:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
thousand and the three thousand I picked
 
03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
those numbers such that
 
03:34:43.729 --> 03:34:43.739 align:start position:0%
the total cost of the bill was roughly
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
one year's worth of benefit
 
03:34:49.130 --> 03:34:49.140 align:start position:0%
to compared to the original House Bill
 
03:34:53.410 --> 03:34:53.420 align:start position:0%
571 right and so by making those numbers
 
03:34:56.570 --> 03:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
two thousand and three thousand it made
 
03:34:58.910 --> 03:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
that it made the calculation work right
 
03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay so therefore in making the one with
 
03:35:03.769 --> 03:35:03.779 align:start position:0%
the ramp
 
03:35:06.590 --> 03:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
I said to myself all right we want to
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
ramp something up to 3 000 where it
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
averages two thousand therefore it
 
03:35:15.650 --> 03:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
should probably start at one thousand if
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean right so we want to
 
03:35:21.290 --> 03:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
ramp one thousand up so the middle point
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
is two thousand so therefore the two
 
03:35:25.849 --> 03:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
bills cost the same
 
03:35:25.859 --> 03:35:32.150 align:start position:0%
bills cost the same
so

03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:36.130 --> 03:35:36.140 align:start position:0%
not seeing any further questions uh
 
03:35:39.889 --> 03:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman uh any idea where we
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:52.849 --> 03:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:01.490 --> 03:36:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
well if you're voting on it today you
 
03:36:05.389 --> 03:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
won't have a physical note but if if you
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
choose this amendment this is something
 
03:36:08.690 --> 03:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to send out to the
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
actuary this would just take a you know
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
a day or two of quenching some numbers
 
03:36:14.809 --> 03:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
and then having somebody you know check
 
03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
the math but because it's a head count
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
type thing like how many people were
 
03:36:20.630 --> 03:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
registered you know between you know 10
 
03:36:23.690 --> 03:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
and 11 11 and 12 and then multiplying it
 
03:36:25.969 --> 03:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
by the amounts so
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
um you know if either one of these we
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
could crunch it roughly you know in a
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
couple of days so if you know by the
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
time it gets father along
 
03:36:37.610 --> 03:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
hey thanks Marty

motion passes the amendment of
571.

03:37:33.710 --> 03:37:33.720 align:start position:0%

thanks representative McGuire you have
 
03:37:37.729 --> 03:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
another one I believe what in 2 30. is
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
that correct 250 sorry well we already
 
03:37:43.010 --> 03:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
did that one all right sorry so we
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
already acted on 250 we just delayed
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
voting it on the in the big committee
 
03:37:51.710 --> 03:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm not specifically proposing any
 
03:37:53.929 --> 03:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
any changes to that I'm I'm still happy
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
with it I think it's correctly written
 
03:37:57.410 --> 03:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
and so on
 
03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
um but there there are other opinions in
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
this room so if anyone else wants to
 
03:38:05.210 --> 03:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
offer some change I could we can talk
 
03:38:07.010 --> 03:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
about it
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
yes represent camber else yes thank you
 
03:38:10.610 --> 03:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:38:13.490 --> 03:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so I have a couple of things to say
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
and uh so the first thing is that I'm
 
03:38:18.290 --> 03:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be withdrawing my
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we make the this is
 
03:38:24.290 --> 03:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 250 we're talking on uh to do
 
03:38:27.769 --> 03:38:27.779 align:start position:0%
this sixty thousand dollars per year I'm
 
03:38:29.090 --> 03:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
going to be withdrawing that that
 
03:38:29.100 --> 03:38:30.889 align:start position:0%
going to be withdrawing that that
recommendation

03:38:30.889 --> 03:38:30.899 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
03:38:33.729 --> 03:38:33.739 align:start position:0%
um what I would like to do is to
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
reconsider uh the amendment that we
 
03:38:40.630 --> 03:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
passed the other day the amendment 2023
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
1045 H and I would like to speak as to
 
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
why I would like to make the
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
reconsideration motion representative
 
03:38:50.269 --> 03:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
Griffin second sure
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
03:38:52.560 --> 03:38:53.269 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
um

03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll be the first one to apologize
 
03:38:57.650 --> 03:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
to the stakeholders and to this
 
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee because shame on me for not
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
having really read the original bill
 
03:39:06.170 --> 03:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
that clearly and also
 
03:39:08.690 --> 03:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
um As I understood the amendment when
 
03:39:10.729 --> 03:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire put it forth to
 
03:39:13.190 --> 03:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
me it looked great I thought it was him
 
03:39:15.969 --> 03:39:15.979 align:start position:0%
doing something good that was very fair
 
03:39:19.010 --> 03:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh not understanding that some of the
 
03:39:21.290 --> 03:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
language that he changed in the
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
amendment meant something to me that
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
meant something different to the
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so for that reason uh in
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
going back and looking at the original
 
03:39:34.429 --> 03:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
Bill uh the original Bill had nothing in
 
03:39:39.530 --> 03:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
it in regards to group one and it had a
 
03:39:42.729 --> 03:39:42.739 align:start position:0%
original language uh
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that was basing the death uh the
 
03:39:52.190 --> 03:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
death benefit on the words annual rate
 
03:39:55.389 --> 03:39:55.399 align:start position:0%
of earnable compensation
 
03:39:58.849 --> 03:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
which representative McGuire uh changed
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
in his Amendment and after having the
 
03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
great dissertation this morning and
 
03:40:06.410 --> 03:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
learning about the system and learning
 
03:40:08.990 --> 03:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
what those two things meant
 
03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:09.710 align:start position:0%
what those two things meant
um

03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:12.469 --> 03:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
it is my consension that the original
 
03:40:17.510 --> 03:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill was good as as was uh it limits our
 
03:40:19.010 --> 03:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
liability because it's only the group
 
03:40:21.349 --> 03:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
two it doesn't include group one
 
03:40:23.570 --> 03:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
I will argue that group one never made
 
03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
any motion to be included on the bill
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
nor did they have any Representatives
 
03:40:27.960 --> 03:40:29.030 align:start position:0%
nor did they have any Representatives
here

03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
so and I will remind the committee that
 
03:40:33.650 --> 03:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
the initial bill the original bill
 
03:40:37.130 --> 03:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
passed committee 15 to 5 and it passed
 
03:40:40.429 --> 03:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
the house 260 to 103. so very very
 
03:40:44.389 --> 03:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
bipartisan and very large margin of so
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time I would like to
 
03:40:47.760 --> 03:40:49.130 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time I would like to
uh

03:40:49.130 --> 03:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:52.190 --> 03:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
reconsider the amendment so that I can
 
03:40:55.370 --> 03:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
make another motion to it all it
 
03:40:56.929 --> 03:40:56.939 align:start position:0%
so that we could get back to the
 
03:41:00.889 --> 03:41:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions comments represent
 
03:41:09.530 --> 03:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
Maguire so I I still like the amendment
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
um it it makes a few changes to the
 
03:41:16.429 --> 03:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
original Bill and first of all it does
 
03:41:16.439 --> 03:41:17.750 align:start position:0%
original Bill and first of all it does
add

03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
add
 
03:41:20.210 --> 03:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
um it does add group one
 
03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
to to an increased benefit so current in
 
03:41:26.030 --> 03:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
current law we we've discovered by the
 
03:41:26.040 --> 03:41:27.290 align:start position:0%
current law we we've discovered by the
way

03:41:27.290 --> 03:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:41:30.889 --> 03:41:30.899 align:start position:0%
um there are currently 19
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
we'll call them widows I mean some could
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
be widowers or children or other kinds
 
03:41:37.610 --> 03:41:37.620 align:start position:0%
of beneficiaries but
 
03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
um there are 19 widows of group two
 
03:41:45.950 --> 03:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
members who are uh accidentally killed
 
03:41:50.170 --> 03:41:50.180 align:start position:0%
um and there are 13 group one members
 
03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
receiving these kind of benefits
 
03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
under current law the group two members
 
03:41:59.630 --> 03:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
and the group one members
 
03:42:03.530 --> 03:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
um the the benefit is based on is 50 of
 
03:42:07.010 --> 03:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
compensation but for some quirk in the
 
03:42:09.889 --> 03:42:09.899 align:start position:0%
way that this is a long time
 
03:42:12.290 --> 03:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
long-standing benefit right it's been in
 
03:42:16.190 --> 03:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
in law for many for decades
 
03:42:19.969 --> 03:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
um but for some Quirk the the group one
 
03:42:22.849 --> 03:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
benefits are based on average final
 
03:42:25.070 --> 03:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
compensation the right side of that
 
03:42:27.710 --> 03:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
chart group two benefits are based on
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation the left side the
 
03:42:32.690 --> 03:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
main difference between the two sides is
 
03:42:37.010 --> 03:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
the right side is an average of could be
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
three could be five highest years of pay
 
03:42:43.309 --> 03:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
with some limitation and the left side
 
03:42:46.490 --> 03:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
is just a number related to one
 
03:42:48.650 --> 03:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
particular year of service the the final
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
year of service okay so there's a
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
difference there and and so that's what
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
current law is fifty percent of the left
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
side for group two the right side for
 
03:43:04.250 --> 03:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
group one
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
so the amendment does uh two things
 
03:43:09.530 --> 03:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
first of all for both groups it changes
 
03:43:12.170 --> 03:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
the 50 to 100 percent
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's what was in the original
 
03:43:13.920 --> 03:43:15.290 align:start position:0%
okay that's what was in the original
bill

03:43:15.290 --> 03:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:43:18.250 --> 03:43:18.260 align:start position:0%
but it adds
 
03:43:21.229 --> 03:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
some limitations
 
03:43:24.050 --> 03:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
because we've discovered that
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
certain beneficiaries
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
are through a quirk of whatever you know
 
03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:31.070 align:start position:0%
are through a quirk of whatever you know
the

03:43:31.070 --> 03:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:34.010 --> 03:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
um their spouse's salary was in a
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
particular year are sort of way up here
 
03:43:39.769 --> 03:43:39.779 align:start position:0%
and and the bulk of beneficiaries are
 
03:43:43.309 --> 03:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
kind of down here so of the 19 in group
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
two as we understand it the total
 
03:43:48.729 --> 03:43:48.739 align:start position:0%
benefit those 19
 
03:43:53.330 --> 03:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
widows receive is about 600 000 a year
 
03:43:56.090 --> 03:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
so roughly each one is say thirty
 
03:43:59.150 --> 03:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year okay but there's
 
03:44:03.110 --> 03:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
one of the 19 who is
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
in like a hundred and twenty five
 
03:44:08.170 --> 03:44:08.180 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year based on the 50
 
03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
calculation and therefore if we were to
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
pass the Bill like it is not that that
 
03:44:16.370 --> 03:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
Widow would change I mean that that
 
03:44:18.530 --> 03:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
Widow is but but if a similar
 
03:44:21.469 --> 03:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
circumstance comes up later that person
 
03:44:23.570 --> 03:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
could be a two hundred and fifty
 
03:44:26.030 --> 03:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars here for example which
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
seems like why should one be treated so
 
03:44:32.450 --> 03:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
much differently than the others right I
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
mean all of them this is a a pension in
 
03:44:39.889 --> 03:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
some sense for death so so it the bill
 
03:44:44.150 --> 03:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
has a cap of 85 000
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
um for both group one group two and
 
03:44:48.889 --> 03:44:48.899 align:start position:0%
um the reason I picked eighty five
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars was simply because I
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
03:44:54.290 --> 03:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
um a hundred thousand dollars is a nice
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
round number this this uh pension is not
 
03:45:02.090 --> 03:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
taxable so so 85 000 not taxable is
 
03:45:03.769 --> 03:45:03.779 align:start position:0%
similar to a hundred thousand taxable
 
03:45:06.229 --> 03:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
all right so there's that the other
 
03:45:11.090 --> 03:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
change in the bill is that
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
um the the both sides both group one and
 
03:45:17.210 --> 03:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
group two would use
 
03:45:19.610 --> 03:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
um average final compensation rather
 
03:45:22.190 --> 03:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
than earnable compensation and the
 
03:45:25.130 --> 03:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
reason for that is
 
03:45:27.769 --> 03:45:27.779 align:start position:0%
um that essentially what we're creating
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
here is a pension
 
03:45:31.849 --> 03:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
right we're creating a pension for
 
03:45:31.859 --> 03:45:33.050 align:start position:0%
right we're creating a pension for
widows

03:45:33.050 --> 03:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
widows
 
03:45:33.060 --> 03:45:34.729 align:start position:0%
widows
and

03:45:34.729 --> 03:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:37.790 --> 03:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
um we don't we deliberately don't create
 
03:45:42.530 --> 03:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
pensions based on one year of service
 
03:45:45.530 --> 03:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
right because that one year could have
 
03:45:49.370 --> 03:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
all kinds of of odd changes right a lot
 
03:45:51.769 --> 03:45:51.779 align:start position:0%
of maybe a lot of overtime a lot of
 
03:45:54.410 --> 03:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
special Duty a lot of whatever or maybe
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
less right maybe maybe that particular
 
03:45:56.760 --> 03:45:59.269 align:start position:0%
less right maybe maybe that particular
year

03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
um you know somebody took uncompensated
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
time off or something right so so it's
 
03:46:07.250 --> 03:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
generally we don't create pensions based
 
03:46:10.370 --> 03:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
on one year we do it on an average so
 
03:46:12.290 --> 03:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
it's more like
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
the the overall earnings of the of the
 
03:46:18.290 --> 03:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
person right so so that's why our
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
pension formula uses the average final
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
compensation not earnable compensation
 
03:46:25.250 --> 03:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
and since this is a kind of a pension
 
03:46:27.290 --> 03:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
it's a pension for widows
 
03:46:29.090 --> 03:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that average final
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
compensation is correct so therefore I I
 
03:46:35.710 --> 03:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
I think the bill is correct now
 
03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
one um
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
one criticism by the we've heard this
 
03:46:45.410 --> 03:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh or this morning was that
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
group one and group two should have
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
different characteristics because one's
 
03:46:52.330 --> 03:46:52.340 align:start position:0%
in Social Security and one isn't right
 
03:46:55.250 --> 03:46:55.260 align:start position:0%
and so you know that that's not
 
03:46:55.260 --> 03:46:57.050 align:start position:0%
and so you know that that's not
unreasonable

03:46:57.050 --> 03:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
03:46:59.830 --> 03:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
um we we expect that a social security
 
03:47:02.570 --> 03:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
death benefit is somewhere on the order
 
03:47:06.110 --> 03:47:06.120 align:start position:0%
of uh maybe twenty five thirty thousand
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
dollars a year something like that so if
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
we wanted to change the cap or the
 
03:47:14.150 --> 03:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
percentage slightly for group one group
 
03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
two you know
 
03:47:18.650 --> 03:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
I suppose that would not be unusual
 
03:47:20.330 --> 03:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
unreasonable but I don't think it's
 
03:47:22.729 --> 03:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
unreasonable as it stands thank you Mr
 
03:47:22.739 --> 03:47:25.849 align:start position:0%
unreasonable as it stands thank you Mr
chairman

03:47:25.849 --> 03:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:28.370 --> 03:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative camber else thank you Mr
 
03:47:30.229 --> 03:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
chair with respect to my esteemed
 
03:47:30.239 --> 03:47:31.790 align:start position:0%
chair with respect to my esteemed
colleague

03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
colleague
 
03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:32.630 align:start position:0%
colleague
um

03:47:32.630 --> 03:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:35.570 --> 03:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
you're treating it as if we have to use
 
03:47:37.870 --> 03:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
the same type of formulas to do pensions
 
03:47:40.750 --> 03:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
when I'm a person who likes Simplicity
 
03:47:44.929 --> 03:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
the bill has originally structured is as
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
simple as can be the formula is simply
 
03:47:49.490 --> 03:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
you take the last 12 months of their
 
03:47:51.769 --> 03:47:51.779 align:start position:0%
salary and you multiply it by a hundred
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
percent done simple there's no reason
 
03:47:58.190 --> 03:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
for why a death benefit like this yes I
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
will agree it looks similar to like a
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
pension plan payout but it doesn't mean
 
03:48:04.670 --> 03:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
we can't use a different formula for it
 
03:48:07.130 --> 03:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
and their status the stakeholders here
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
are completely satisfied with the
 
03:48:12.050 --> 03:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
current way and the current language so
 
03:48:13.729 --> 03:48:13.739 align:start position:0%
I would I would default to them because
 
03:48:18.290 --> 03:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.269 --> 03:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a question for
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire would you be
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
amenable to
 
03:48:29.450 --> 03:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
for group two swapping annual rate of
 
03:48:31.729 --> 03:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation at the death of
 
03:48:34.130 --> 03:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
restoring that for average final
 
03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
compensation but keeping the cap in it
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
seems to me in my my read on what the
 
03:48:42.590 --> 03:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are opposing might be wrong
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
but it really does seem getting that
 
03:48:46.729 --> 03:48:46.739 align:start position:0%
annual rate of earnable compensation at
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
the date of the member's death is is
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
what they is what people want to see so
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
if we swap that out keep your cap idea
 
03:48:56.750 --> 03:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that your scenario of
 
03:49:00.229 --> 03:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
the 240 000 payout per year won't be
 
03:49:03.290 --> 03:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
happening would that be something
 
03:49:05.090 --> 03:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
you could agree to
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:49:06.359 --> 03:49:08.330 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

03:49:08.330 --> 03:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:11.269 --> 03:49:11.279 align:start position:0%
um I would vote against such a thing for
 
03:49:14.150 --> 03:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
the reasons that I just gave that it
 
03:49:18.650 --> 03:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem right to leave a widow at
 
03:49:20.210 --> 03:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
the mercy of
 
03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what the circumstances were on
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
one particular year when it when it
 
03:49:28.490 --> 03:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:49:31.010 --> 03:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
um an app you know the average the
 
03:49:33.290 --> 03:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
single year could easily be lower or
 
03:49:35.690 --> 03:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
high or higher than than the average
 
03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
03:49:38.160 --> 03:49:38.830 align:start position:0%
right and so
um

03:49:38.830 --> 03:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
rather than their general standard of
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
living sort of
 
03:49:45.889 --> 03:49:45.899 align:start position:0%
which is what the average creates if you
 
03:49:48.170 --> 03:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
see what I mean
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
and and realize again we're we're making
 
03:49:53.650 --> 03:49:53.660 align:start position:0%
we're doubling the benefit
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
which has been in law for decades right
 
03:49:59.950 --> 03:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
so this is a significant increase
 
03:50:02.590 --> 03:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
whichever way that go that particular
 
03:50:09.710 --> 03:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.389 --> 03:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
Marty you
 
03:50:17.090 --> 03:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:17.100 --> 03:50:26.570 align:start position:0%
 
Marty

03:50:26.570 --> 03:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:29.570 --> 03:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I just um I certainly be glad to
 
03:50:31.610 --> 03:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
answer any questions before that they'll
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
just say that for the record nhrs
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a position on the original
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
bill or the amendment this is the policy
 
03:50:38.100 --> 03:50:39.530 align:start position:0%
bill or the amendment this is the policy
decision

03:50:39.530 --> 03:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:50:41.210 --> 03:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
um when you're putting you know price on
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know someone's life and line of duty
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's a lot to put on and it's
 
03:50:48.590 --> 03:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's on on you also you know we don't
 
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
have a right or wrong answer for that
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's like you have to weigh that
 
03:50:51.960 --> 03:50:54.889 align:start position:0%
it's like you have to weigh that
yourselves

03:50:54.889 --> 03:50:54.899 align:start position:0%
yourselves
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
was some concern expressed by some that
 
03:51:00.050 --> 03:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
the new language would prevent someone
 
03:51:03.410 --> 03:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
from getting this benefit uh the way
 
03:51:06.590 --> 03:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's written if they didn't have uh
 
03:51:08.630 --> 03:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
sufficient time like 10 years of service
 
03:51:08.640 --> 03:51:10.690 align:start position:0%
sufficient time like 10 years of service
yes

03:51:10.690 --> 03:51:10.700 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:51:13.309 --> 03:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
our reading of the amendment is the the
 
03:51:16.670 --> 03:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
qualification for it is in section uh 1A
 
03:51:20.450 --> 03:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
and 2A of 188 this this amendment is to
 
03:51:22.729 --> 03:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
section B which is the actual benefit
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
amount but the circumstances the death
 
03:51:27.229 --> 03:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
that section doesn't say anything about
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
vesting now and it wouldn't under this
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance the the question may have
 
03:51:34.370 --> 03:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
been if someone didn't have enough ears
 
03:51:38.269 --> 03:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
to have a full AFC heavy penalizer they
 
03:51:41.570 --> 03:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
get zeros for some of that time and no
 
03:51:43.790 --> 03:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's like in under current conditions
 
03:51:45.290 --> 03:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
whether it's a you know a death a
 
03:51:47.630 --> 03:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
disability or some other situation where
 
03:51:49.190 --> 03:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't have the three or the
 
03:51:51.290 --> 03:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
five years you know we prorate that to
 
03:51:53.090 --> 03:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
how many years they have of service I
 
03:51:54.769 --> 03:51:54.779 align:start position:0%
mean in the case of somebody who was you
 
03:51:56.330 --> 03:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
know killed in their first month there
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
would be a month of salary that we'd
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
extrapolate into it in ASC but we you
 
03:52:02.570 --> 03:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
know we don't people don't get zeros if
 
03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
they have less than three or five years
 
03:52:06.889 --> 03:52:06.899 align:start position:0%
and then the bill wouldn't
 
03:52:09.410 --> 03:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
make this only for vested members the
 
03:52:12.110 --> 03:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
The Accidental I mean the non-accidental
 
03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
death the non-job-related death you know
 
03:52:15.650 --> 03:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
you could get a disease or something
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
that has always had a 10-year you had to
 
03:52:20.809 --> 03:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
be vested to apply or to receive those
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
benefits so that that's a different
 
03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
section of the statute not this one
 
03:52:27.710 --> 03:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
thanks for clearing that up um other
 
03:52:29.210 --> 03:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
members of the division please
 
03:52:31.130 --> 03:52:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative kimbrells well John
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
having said that our final Financial
 
03:52:36.110 --> 03:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
standpoint adding again one of the
 
03:52:38.870 --> 03:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
changes it made was adding group one we
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
just added more liability when uh it
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't requested uh if we keep it to the
 
03:52:47.450 --> 03:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
original Bill the uh the on a financial
 
03:52:49.309 --> 03:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
standpoint we will only have that
 
03:52:51.530 --> 03:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
liability to group two if group one
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
wants it they can come next year and
 
03:52:55.969 --> 03:52:55.979 align:start position:0%
file a bill and ask for it but for there
 
03:52:57.410 --> 03:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
was really no reason to include group
 
03:52:59.630 --> 03:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
one and again they do get the social
 
03:53:02.269 --> 03:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
security benefit whereas group two does
 
03:53:02.279 --> 03:53:08.990 align:start position:0%
security benefit whereas group two does
not

03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
from The Division I was just speaking
 
03:53:14.150 --> 03:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
for myself I actually like
 
03:53:16.010 --> 03:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's amendment I
 
03:53:18.410 --> 03:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
know the folks from group one didn't ask
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
but I think if we can make something
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
better sometimes it works and as I've
 
03:53:25.610 --> 03:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned before we're kind of an unruly
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
group so we sometimes step outside the
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
rails but
 
03:53:33.650 --> 03:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire anything further
 
03:53:33.660 --> 03:53:37.510 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire anything further
foreign

03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:41.150 --> 03:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
no other questions uh representative
 
03:53:43.490 --> 03:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
cambrell's and it was seconded by
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin asked that we
 
03:53:49.010 --> 03:53:49.020 align:start position:0%

03:53:53.210 --> 03:53:53.220 align:start position:0%

amendment to 250 10 45 H the motion was
 
03:54:25.210 --> 03:54:25.220 align:start position:0%

okay so it's five to three
 
03:55:03.889 --> 03:55:03.899 align:start position:0%

03:55:07.370 --> 03:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
to four okay so where does that
 
03:55:10.189 --> 03:55:10.199 align:start position:0%

03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
all right

03:55:18.110 --> 03:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:20.330 --> 03:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
moving right along you don't have
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
anything else do you represent I just
 
03:55:23.210 --> 03:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
want to tell the people on the other
 
03:55:25.189 --> 03:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
side obviously they can bring this up
 
03:55:28.370 --> 03:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
again in the full finance committee yeah
 
03:55:33.590 --> 03:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.990 --> 03:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have any more retirement bills
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
I believe oh I'm sorry
 
03:55:41.090 --> 03:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
Melissa we do not have any more but I
 
03:55:42.950 --> 03:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
did have a question for you
 
03:55:45.050 --> 03:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
um for the amendment that was adopted
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
for 571 do you want that as is or would
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
you like that added to hb2 because
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's a physical impact
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh division preference representative
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
with why are you yes hp2 please
 
03:56:05.689 --> 03:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:12.729 --> 03:56:12.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah so that's a
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
question as to whether 250 would be
 
03:56:21.110 --> 03:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate for hb2 or not because it
 
03:56:23.210 --> 03:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
it's really just a policy thing it
 
03:56:26.210 --> 03:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any fiscal note well it has
 
03:56:27.950 --> 03:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
a maybe it has a fiscal note but it
 
03:56:30.170 --> 03:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a sort of an immediate cost
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
right so it's it would only be suggested
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
Standalone yeah stand alone okay that's
 
03:56:40.969 --> 03:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:45.290 --> 03:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:49.010 --> 03:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
I think we're ready to move to
 
03:56:49.020 --> 03:56:53.150 align:start position:0%
I think we're ready to move to
oplc

03:56:53.150 --> 03:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.160 --> 03:56:54.250 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:56:54.250 --> 03:56:54.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%

we'll take a little breather here we get
 
03:59:01.610 --> 03:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of papers in front of us while

03:59:05.870 --> 03:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah this is what it looks like we got
 
03:59:08.570 --> 03:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
them Friday yeah would representative
 
03:59:12.969 --> 03:59:12.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:17.090 --> 03:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
hmm I would I think those three
 
03:59:17.100 --> 03:59:18.590 align:start position:0%
hmm I would I think those three
amendments

03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:59:18.600 --> 03:59:20.630 align:start position:0%
amendments
address

03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:59:22.969 --> 03:59:22.979 align:start position:0%
what we've all heard
 
03:59:26.330 --> 03:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
in emails and telephone calls
 
03:59:28.969 --> 03:59:28.979 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:59:28.979 --> 03:59:30.650 align:start position:0%

uh

03:59:30.650 --> 03:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
as far as the rest of the items and
 
03:59:38.389 --> 03:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:40.849 --> 03:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
their policy issues
 
03:59:43.130 --> 03:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think Finance should be involved
 
03:59:44.510 --> 03:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
in them
 
03:59:44.520 --> 03:59:46.670 align:start position:0%
in them
and

03:59:46.670 --> 03:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:49.250 --> 03:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
the governor obviously approved him and
 
03:59:50.809 --> 03:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
won some
 
03:59:50.819 --> 03:59:53.389 align:start position:0%
won some
so

03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:57.650 --> 03:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:01.330 --> 04:00:01.340 align:start position:0%

believe some of the division members
 
04:00:24.050 --> 04:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:24.060 --> 04:00:25.750 align:start position:0%

representative McGuire group we're still
 
04:00:39.769 --> 04:00:39.779 align:start position:0%
having some trouble with some of the
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
members for finding that document that
 
04:00:43.969 --> 04:00:43.979 align:start position:0%
you presented last Friday do we have any
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
extra copies of Melissa yeah yeah right
 
04:00:53.170 --> 04:00:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
they prefer this one representative
 
04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
sweetie that's more comprehensive yeah
 
04:01:02.769 --> 04:01:02.779 align:start position:0%
he moved from one two and four oh okay
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know about that they haven't
 
04:01:11.870 --> 04:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:11.880 --> 04:01:13.309 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:01:13.319 --> 04:01:15.830 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

04:01:15.830 --> 04:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.110 --> 04:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
and those are all pretty innocent
 
04:01:21.429 --> 04:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
correct yeah
 
04:01:24.290 --> 04:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
how are we going to deal with it which
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
we did talk about right we didn't talk
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
about it but this is one way the other
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
way it's just salute the second
 
04:01:34.729 --> 04:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
we can revise the board right I'm
 
04:01:48.670 --> 04:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:55.610 --> 04:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:58.189 --> 04:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
so we've asked you to take the C to
 
04:02:01.429 --> 04:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
answer any questions perhaps on some of
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
the items that
 
04:02:05.929 --> 04:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
are referenced and representative
 
04:02:09.050 --> 04:02:09.060 align:start position:0%
Griffin's motion I noticed Amendment two
 
04:02:12.050 --> 04:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
it says not fully vetted so I'd like to
 
04:02:13.370 --> 04:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
get your
 
04:02:15.769 --> 04:02:15.779 align:start position:0%
take on the not fully vetted
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative Rhoda
 
04:02:21.050 --> 04:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you the committee felt that
 
04:02:24.170 --> 04:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
one time the board of psychology and the
 
04:02:26.450 --> 04:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
board of mental health were separated
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
and this bill merges the two
 
04:02:33.530 --> 04:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
and because there was an a concern that
 
04:02:37.010 --> 04:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
this could hadn't been
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
vetted well
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
that it should be separated out of the
 
04:02:45.050 --> 04:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
bill and we've put together upon your
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
approval of course a subcommittee to
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
looking on this at this particular part
 
04:02:52.610 --> 04:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
of house bill 2.
 
04:02:55.849 --> 04:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
I would like to add that that section
 
04:02:59.330 --> 04:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
also adds to that merge board the board
 
04:03:01.729 --> 04:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
of licensed Alcohol and Other Drug
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
counselors which is something that has
 
04:03:08.210 --> 04:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
been considered multiple times in the
 
04:03:10.809 --> 04:03:10.819 align:start position:0%
past and never accepted
 
04:03:14.210 --> 04:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
so we would like to take it take a shot
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
at dealing with this it doesn't have any
 
04:03:19.969 --> 04:03:19.979 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact that I can find none of
 
04:03:22.729 --> 04:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
that language adds or deletes a license
 
04:03:26.929 --> 04:03:26.939 align:start position:0%
it merely restructures the boards
 
04:03:29.389 --> 04:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
so we don't think it it should bother
 
04:03:32.210 --> 04:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
you if we take it out of your bill
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
okay I I just want to say I really
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate you all the time that I know
 
04:03:38.689 --> 04:03:38.699 align:start position:0%
both of you have spent trying to deal
 
04:03:41.150 --> 04:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
with this huge task and I understand
 
04:03:43.130 --> 04:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
that the chair has
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
named you as I guess what the
 
04:03:47.330 --> 04:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair to start looking at
 
04:03:49.330 --> 04:03:49.340 align:start position:0%
this so people can get it
 
04:03:53.929 --> 04:03:53.939 align:start position:0%
these three amendments were essentially
 
04:03:57.170 --> 04:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
unanimous in Edna that
 
04:03:57.180 --> 04:03:58.070 align:start position:0%
unanimous in Edna that
um

04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
the technical changes in Amendment one
 
04:04:04.429 --> 04:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
pulling out the board of Mental Health
 
04:04:06.969 --> 04:04:06.979 align:start position:0%
we had a show of hands and 15 people
 
04:04:10.010 --> 04:04:10.020 align:start position:0%
from the committee immediately said yes
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
we need to deal with that and the other
 
04:04:14.750 --> 04:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
five may have been just been slower I
 
04:04:16.849 --> 04:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell there was no objection to
 
04:04:19.550 --> 04:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
pulling that out Amendment four is the
 
04:04:23.570 --> 04:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
lnas uh that's the simpler way to deal
 
04:04:25.550 --> 04:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
with it just pull out the section that
 
04:04:28.610 --> 04:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
changes the Board of Nursing we've
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
received a great deal of of information
 
04:04:35.030 --> 04:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
on that regarding the certification and
 
04:04:38.410 --> 04:04:38.420 align:start position:0%
the use of lnas and we think it
 
04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:40.439 align:start position:0%
we think that the language that's
 
04:04:45.290 --> 04:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.170 --> 04:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
next for your candor
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Maguire thank you so
 
04:04:52.729 --> 04:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
notice that all three of these
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
amendments we're talking about are
 
04:04:57.229 --> 04:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
deletions primarily right they are
 
04:05:01.130 --> 04:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
removing things from from the uh bills
 
04:05:04.429 --> 04:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
so so if you voted against them you
 
04:05:06.650 --> 04:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
would be saying I want to leave that
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
section in House Bill too as opposed to
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
I want to remove right so yeah the only
 
04:05:17.150 --> 04:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
obvious uh fiscal note is on the First
 
04:05:20.809 --> 04:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
Amendment where Edna was unanimous and
 
04:05:24.590 --> 04:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
saying if there are any licenses deleted
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
the fee needs to be re
 
04:05:29.570 --> 04:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
restored to the people who had you know
 
04:05:31.130 --> 04:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
in some cases may have just paid for it
 
04:05:32.750 --> 04:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
last week
 
04:05:36.469 --> 04:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
um the we spoke about that with the oplc
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
and they would rather just refund the
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
whole amount than spend the labor to
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
prorate them and I think most people
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
would agree with would be happy with
 
04:05:47.689 --> 04:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
thanks representative McGuire
 
04:05:51.120 --> 04:05:52.630 align:start position:0%
thanks representative McGuire
uh

04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
04:05:55.800 --> 04:05:56.689 align:start position:0%
representative evil
um

04:05:56.689 --> 04:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:56.699 --> 04:05:59.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:05:59.870 --> 04:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
a vast swath of the PLC section in hb2
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's if we voted
 
04:06:11.210 --> 04:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
to put to pull these out of hb2 isn't
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
there still a lot that's left yes that
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
you haven't really had an opportunity to
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
correct but we did do triage and these
 
04:06:27.130 --> 04:06:27.140 align:start position:0%
are the items that came out as urgent
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
we do not the the technical changes in
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment one we want we passed several
 
04:06:37.010 --> 04:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
bills or one case killed a bill we
 
04:06:38.990 --> 04:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to put the house make sure the
 
04:06:42.050 --> 04:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
house policy was reflected we wanted to
 
04:06:44.330 --> 04:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
not have duplicative language in House
 
04:06:47.269 --> 04:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 and House Bill 655 because that's
 
04:06:50.510 --> 04:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
always a nightmare to keep in mind
 
04:06:54.229 --> 04:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
and the red the other ones are mostly um
 
04:06:59.090 --> 04:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.830 --> 04:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
so um I think we heard from many people
 
04:07:06.050 --> 04:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
who in the hearings that we've had on
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
two successive Fridays whose livelihoods
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
would be affected by what would remain
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
in hb2 if we only pass these amendments
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh I don't doubt that most of those
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
people attended the two hearings that
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
Edna held on this section uh and we
 
04:07:30.050 --> 04:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
heard we've gotten the same Deluge of
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
emails the thing is that that
 
04:07:34.080 --> 04:07:35.870 align:start position:0%
emails the thing is that that
uh

04:07:35.870 --> 04:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:07:38.450 --> 04:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
none of those Rose to the level of
 
04:07:40.610 --> 04:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
urgency as these the board of mental
 
04:07:43.729 --> 04:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
health was was a specific issue the LNA
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
license was a specific issue there were
 
04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who were
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
concerned about other
 
04:07:51.479 --> 04:07:53.030 align:start position:0%
concerned about other
sections

04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
sections
 
04:07:55.309 --> 04:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
but they didn't get get the consensus of
 
04:07:58.490 --> 04:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
fair enough thanks representative so if
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
I could if I could add so House Bill 655
 
04:08:08.269 --> 04:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
was a massive bill because you have an
 
04:08:08.279 --> 04:08:10.010 align:start position:0%
was a massive bill because you have an
hb2

04:08:10.010 --> 04:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
04:08:10.020 --> 04:08:12.490 align:start position:0%
hb2
and

04:08:12.490 --> 04:08:12.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:08:14.929 --> 04:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
changes in the bill
 
04:08:19.849 --> 04:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
in relationship to the amount of time
 
04:08:22.010 --> 04:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
that we had to review those changes and
 
04:08:24.889 --> 04:08:24.899 align:start position:0%
the amount of time that we had to work
 
04:08:27.889 --> 04:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
with those people involved was
 
04:08:27.899 --> 04:08:30.769 align:start position:0%
with those people involved was
disproportional

04:08:30.769 --> 04:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
disproportional
 
04:08:30.779 --> 04:08:32.090 align:start position:0%
disproportional
so

04:08:32.090 --> 04:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
we met as a we met we had some we had
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
two sub-committee sessions
 
04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
and what the results of those two
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee session was Amendment one
 
04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
right so that's
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
that took some time and that is what the
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
first 12 pages of house bill
 
04:08:52.490 --> 04:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
about the oplc part
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then it was definitely a concern for
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
some of the members that the mental
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
health board was being merged and then
 
04:09:02.650 --> 04:09:02.660 align:start position:0%
there was also a concern for the lnas
 
04:09:04.490 --> 04:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
but really
 
04:09:06.889 --> 04:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
you know we didn't come to a consensus
 
04:09:09.410 --> 04:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
because at that time we really wouldn't
 
04:09:11.990 --> 04:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
have had enough time because of the
 
04:09:14.450 --> 04:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
amount of decisions that had to be made
 
04:09:18.410 --> 04:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
so triage is a word to use however
 
04:09:21.050 --> 04:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to be said with the
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and um so that's something I think
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
you need to consider and it's something
 
04:09:31.969 --> 04:09:31.979 align:start position:0%
that we spoke about last Friday right I
 
04:09:35.090 --> 04:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
mean how much time do we
 
04:09:37.010 --> 04:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
you know do we have on something like
 
04:09:38.389 --> 04:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
this right
 
04:09:40.490 --> 04:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
which is massive
 
04:09:44.510 --> 04:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative evil follow up so
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the things in hb2 was that for
 
04:09:50.510 --> 04:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the boards there was a change
 
04:09:53.809 --> 04:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
for disciplinary actions from the board
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
to the executive director and we were
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
we've gotten an awful lot of emails from
 
04:10:02.809 --> 04:10:02.819 align:start position:0%
people who were really concerned about
 
04:10:06.410 --> 04:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
that yes we have too the thing is that
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
that was one of the central parts from
 
04:10:12.130 --> 04:10:12.140 align:start position:0%
the study committee on oplc organization
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the reorganization which is in house
 
04:10:18.530 --> 04:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
bill 655.
 
04:10:18.540 --> 04:10:22.130 align:start position:0%
bill 655.
the

04:10:22.130 --> 04:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:25.610 --> 04:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
especially for the smaller boards they
 
04:10:30.050 --> 04:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
don't have the capacity or the
 
04:10:32.809 --> 04:10:32.819 align:start position:0%
distance from the affected people in
 
04:10:35.809 --> 04:10:35.819 align:start position:0%
many cases to in order to investigate or
 
04:10:40.750 --> 04:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
to hold a hearing so we can we
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:45.239 --> 04:10:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
part of discipline away from the boards
 
04:10:53.450 --> 04:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
and had the oplc hire professional
 
04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
investigators from the profession who
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
had the skill who knew about what was
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:11:03.229 --> 04:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
in order to investigate it in many of
 
04:11:05.210 --> 04:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
the professions it's hard to find
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not related or connected
 
04:11:07.920 --> 04:11:08.809 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not related or connected
with

04:11:08.809 --> 04:11:08.819 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:11:11.210 --> 04:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
everyone else in the profession so we
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
might have to go out of state to hire
 
04:11:12.840 --> 04:11:15.229 align:start position:0%
might have to go out of state to hire
somebody

04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.170 --> 04:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
but that was a deliberate decision that
 
04:11:21.050 --> 04:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
the board should not be responsible for
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
the investigation they are still
 
04:11:25.849 --> 04:11:25.859 align:start position:0%
involved in the discipline by a long
 
04:11:25.859 --> 04:11:26.929 align:start position:0%
involved in the discipline by a long
shot

04:11:26.929 --> 04:11:26.939 align:start position:0%
shot
 
04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
even the advisory boards are involved in
 
04:11:29.640 --> 04:11:30.950 align:start position:0%
even the advisory boards are involved in
discipline

04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
the but this just gets a more
 
04:11:35.279 --> 04:11:37.729 align:start position:0%
the but this just gets a more
organized

04:11:37.729 --> 04:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
organized
 
04:11:37.739 --> 04:11:38.510 align:start position:0%
organized
um

04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
approach to discipline and more and it
 
04:11:45.050 --> 04:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
consolidates it in the oplc where you
 
04:11:48.290 --> 04:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
can share your investigate the the
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
hearings officers and so forth a great
 
04:11:53.330 --> 04:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
many of the boards don't get very many
 
04:11:53.340 --> 04:11:55.130 align:start position:0%
many of the boards don't get very many
complaints

04:11:55.130 --> 04:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
04:11:57.290 --> 04:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
something to be proud of really but it
 
04:11:59.210 --> 04:11:59.220 align:start position:0%
means if they do get a serious complaint
 
04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
they have to dust off their manuals and
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
figure out how to how to handle it and
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
so having a hearings examiner would be
 
04:12:07.199 --> 04:12:10.490 align:start position:0%
so having a hearings examiner would be
useful

04:12:10.490 --> 04:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:12.530 --> 04:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
so there's two comments that I want to
 
04:12:14.450 --> 04:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
make about that
 
04:12:17.210 --> 04:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
um it's true that some boards
 
04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
um could become advisory boards based on
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of work that they have and
 
04:12:27.170 --> 04:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
the and the availability of people to
 
04:12:29.809 --> 04:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
come to advise you to come to board
 
04:12:31.849 --> 04:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
meetings is
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
can be than necessarily but can be
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
difficult however there have been two
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
things that have been passed this month
 
04:12:41.450 --> 04:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
this this session which I hope I'll go
 
04:12:41.460 --> 04:12:42.229 align:start position:0%
this this session which I hope I'll go
through

04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
is that it's to allow virtual meetings
 
04:12:46.370 --> 04:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
of state agencies
 
04:12:50.090 --> 04:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
and to allow virtual meetings of boards
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
so those two things I hope will help
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
but and although the study committee
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
made a result you know result made these
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations those recommendations as
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
much as we
 
04:13:06.830 --> 04:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
we respect the work that the committee
 
04:13:10.729 --> 04:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
commission has done or the committee has
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
done we as a board Heaven at me as a
 
04:13:15.590 --> 04:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee haven't looked at them and the
 
04:13:19.010 --> 04:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
fact that no boards were consulted
 
04:13:22.130 --> 04:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
per the testimony is concerning to me
 
04:13:23.689 --> 04:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
because I certainly would want to have
 
04:13:29.590 --> 04:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Maguire and thank you
 
04:13:35.090 --> 04:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so I want to ask you to
 
04:13:35.100 --> 04:13:36.229 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so I want to ask you to
um

04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:38.750 --> 04:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
how would you predict if if this section
 
04:13:42.050 --> 04:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 was a bill in your
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
committee next year do you think that
 
04:13:48.849 --> 04:13:48.859 align:start position:0%
the remaining parts
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
that this amend these amendments leave
 
04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
in are likely to pass
 
04:13:58.250 --> 04:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh are likely to be chopped up a little
 
04:14:00.410 --> 04:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
are likely to be just rejected
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
altogether what do you think okay so are
 
04:14:04.610 --> 04:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
you tell are you are you saying that the
 
04:14:06.889 --> 04:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
things that are left over after we do
 
04:14:06.899 --> 04:14:08.870 align:start position:0%
things that are left over after we do
the

04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
um I think that there would be an
 
04:14:12.889 --> 04:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
Earnest effort to look at them and take
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
them as recommendations
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
I mean we all we all recognize that oplc
 
04:14:19.969 --> 04:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
is an organization that needs to
 
04:14:23.150 --> 04:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
function efficiently right at the same
 
04:14:25.010 --> 04:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
time we don't want to make a burdensome
 
04:14:28.729 --> 04:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
for the public or for businesses at the
 
04:14:30.290 --> 04:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
same time we want to make sure that
 
04:14:30.300 --> 04:14:31.790 align:start position:0%
same time we want to make sure that
proper

04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
proper
 
04:14:31.800 --> 04:14:33.189 align:start position:0%
proper
um

04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:37.250 --> 04:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
safety measures are put in and that
 
04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
um you have adjudication and
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
investigation separated they can't be
 
04:14:44.090 --> 04:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
together something that we haven't
 
04:14:46.010 --> 04:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
talked about is that those two things
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
are now being joined in the Board of
 
04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
Medicine with the elimination so these
 
04:14:50.929 --> 04:14:50.939 align:start position:0%
are all things these are all big
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
decisions and I would certainly
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
um from my part and I'm sure from chair
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
Maguire's part we would work together on
 
04:15:01.309 --> 04:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
it to make sure that it was you know
 
04:15:05.450 --> 04:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
my analysis would be that some parts
 
04:15:09.229 --> 04:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
would just sail through as good ideas
 
04:15:13.070 --> 04:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
some parts would be reworked extensively
 
04:15:15.530 --> 04:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
and some parts would be uh battle to the
 
04:15:15.540 --> 04:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
and some parts would be uh battle to the
death

04:15:16.550 --> 04:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
death
 
04:15:16.560 --> 04:15:20.870 align:start position:0%
death
so

04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:22.610 --> 04:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
Mack Fowler
 
04:15:22.620 --> 04:15:24.590 align:start position:0%
Mack Fowler
yeah

04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:15:27.429 --> 04:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:15:30.050 --> 04:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
my judgment I I guess I'm going to have
 
04:15:31.370 --> 04:15:31.380 align:start position:0%
to vote even though I second I'm gonna
 
04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
have to vote against this motion because
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
my judgment is I mean they're talking
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
about not having enough time
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know whatever they have we have a
 
04:15:42.290 --> 04:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
tenth of that right so it's like we have
 
04:15:45.410 --> 04:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
another two hours here or something so
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
um and then there's also
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
you know like it or not there's the
 
04:15:53.410 --> 04:15:53.420 align:start position:0%
political aspect of we have to find
 
04:15:57.290 --> 04:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
180 90 votes to pass a budget right and
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
and it it would be chaos for the state
 
04:16:04.570 --> 04:16:04.580 align:start position:0%
the budget is a plan for how we display
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
State Financial Resources over two years
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
and it would be kind of chaos if we
 
04:16:14.450 --> 04:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
don't have such a plan right so we
 
04:16:14.460 --> 04:16:15.590 align:start position:0%
don't have such a plan right so we
shouldn't

04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
04:16:20.809 --> 04:16:20.819 align:start position:0%
put things in that that have no ask you
 
04:16:22.969 --> 04:16:22.979 align:start position:0%
know that don't seriously touch on
 
04:16:22.979 --> 04:16:24.650 align:start position:0%
know that don't seriously touch on
finances

04:16:24.650 --> 04:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
finances
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
um cause people not to vote for the
 
04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
budget right I mean it's that simple
 
04:16:35.090 --> 04:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
right and and the question is if we pass
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
these things is it more likely a gain or
 
04:16:39.349 --> 04:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
a loss
 
04:16:42.050 --> 04:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
and I you know my unfortunate judgment
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
is it's a loss and so
 
04:16:45.479 --> 04:16:46.630 align:start position:0%
is it's a loss and so
um

04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:50.689 --> 04:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm strongly in favor of
 
04:16:53.330 --> 04:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing but unfortunately at
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
this time
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
04:17:04.250 --> 04:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Dan
 
04:17:08.030 --> 04:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
Maguire I think that um too much has
 
04:17:11.630 --> 04:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
been put into hb2 too quickly it's
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
policy and I believe that if we vote in
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
favor of the policy we own the policy
 
04:17:21.650 --> 04:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm not willing to own vast swaths
 
04:17:24.110 --> 04:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
of what is put in in because we haven't
 
04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
had time to analyze it and we don't have
 
04:17:31.309 --> 04:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
the expertise that e-dna has and
 
04:17:33.769 --> 04:17:33.779 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like I mean I don't
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
think Edna has really had a an
 
04:17:39.610 --> 04:17:39.620 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fully uh vet this thing
 
04:17:42.349 --> 04:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
we do have the three amendments and we
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate having them but I've heard
 
04:17:48.050 --> 04:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
nothing that makes me think that you've
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
had adequate time to go through the
 
04:17:53.450 --> 04:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
whole thing so I I'll be voting with due
 
04:17:57.650 --> 04:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
further comments from members of the
 
04:17:59.760 --> 04:18:02.030 align:start position:0%
further comments from members of the
division

04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:18:04.490 --> 04:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
well I had the opportunity along with
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney to have some
 
04:18:07.849 --> 04:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
discussions this morning with the
 
04:18:09.889 --> 04:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
governor and I brought this specific
 
04:18:13.670 --> 04:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
issue up and I explained my concern that
 
04:18:18.290 --> 04:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
the boards and other agencies that are
 
04:18:20.050 --> 04:18:20.060 align:start position:0%
embedded in the pl
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:29.090 --> 04:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
um that nobody was consulted
 
04:18:31.490 --> 04:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
and he said that's correct he worked
 
04:18:34.370 --> 04:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
with the executive director and himself
 
04:18:37.150 --> 04:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
and his staff in the whole intent of not
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
involving people is to get their
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
attention and I told him he had
 
04:18:44.110 --> 04:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
certainly gotten their attention
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
and that I also went on to say I thought
 
04:18:49.570 --> 04:18:49.580 align:start position:0%
it should be more thoroughly reviewed by
 
04:18:53.210 --> 04:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee and he said you can
 
04:18:55.370 --> 04:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
certainly tell your group that it was my
 
04:18:58.610 --> 04:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
intention to put it out there so
 
04:19:00.410 --> 04:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
um anyway at that and
 
04:19:02.689 --> 04:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
with the regret representative Griffin I
 
04:19:09.530 --> 04:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
if there are any further questions there
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
is a motion before us to accept
 
04:19:21.110 --> 04:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment one two three four and well
 
04:19:26.050 --> 04:19:26.060 align:start position:0%
not three so one two four one two four
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
that was offered by uh representative
 
04:19:33.050 --> 04:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
Griffin signal further discussion
 
04:19:35.689 --> 04:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
the clerical please call the rule okay
 
04:19:39.530 --> 04:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative McGuire no
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney no representative
 
04:19:48.610 --> 04:19:48.620 align:start position:0%
Campbell's no representative grassy no
 
04:19:51.290 --> 04:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt no
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
Clark vert's votes no chair Leachman no
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
okay so it is
 
04:20:01.490 --> 04:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
seven to one no
 
04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
so the motion to adopt oplc amendments
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
one two and four is defeated the chair
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
would look forward to another motion I
 
04:20:13.490 --> 04:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
believe representative McGuire has a
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
motion yes I'll move um Amendment 11 26
 
04:20:17.040 --> 04:20:23.630 align:start position:0%
motion yes I'll move um Amendment 11 26
h

04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:25.309 --> 04:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
and once everyone has a copy
 
04:20:27.110 --> 04:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire if you could
 
04:20:32.990 --> 04:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.000 --> 04:20:49.969 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:20:49.969 --> 04:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:52.849 --> 04:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
all right so it this bill this this
 
04:20:52.859 --> 04:20:54.410 align:start position:0%
all right so it this bill this this
amendment

04:20:54.410 --> 04:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:20:58.370 --> 04:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
line one deletes this entire section
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay and then the rest of the the rest
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
of the pages add back certain parts with
 
04:21:10.010 --> 04:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
on occasion changes but but generally
 
04:21:12.910 --> 04:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
speaking no
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that we're all
 
04:21:19.370 --> 04:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:22.370 --> 04:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
um so you're deleting the entire section
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
in HB 2 of the oplc and you're going to
 
04:21:30.729 --> 04:21:30.739 align:start position:0%
be working to reinsert stuff from
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
655 or no 650 6.55 explain how it
 
04:21:40.610 --> 04:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.150 --> 04:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's not 6.55 no but this
 
04:21:47.870 --> 04:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
um I admit I worked on this and most of
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
these are are items that are
 
04:21:55.610 --> 04:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
independent of 655 there is for example
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
the movement of a number of boards from
 
04:22:03.550 --> 04:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
and there's some cleanup we move the
 
04:22:06.840 --> 04:22:08.170 align:start position:0%
and there's some cleanup we move the
assessing

04:22:08.170 --> 04:22:08.180 align:start position:0%
assessing
 
04:22:10.729 --> 04:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
certification board and some of the
 
04:22:12.769 --> 04:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
language needed last year when some of
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
the language new cleanup that was
 
04:22:18.530 --> 04:22:18.540 align:start position:0%
included in house bill 2. and it appears
 
04:22:22.910 --> 04:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.370 --> 04:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
okay representative groda I see you've
 
04:22:27.469 --> 04:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
moved the mic well I haven't looked at
 
04:22:29.210 --> 04:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
this but
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at it from the back to
 
04:22:34.370 --> 04:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
the front and
 
04:22:34.380 --> 04:22:36.410 align:start position:0%
the front and
um

04:22:36.410 --> 04:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:39.889 --> 04:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
it repeals so like on page 21 I'm
 
04:22:41.710 --> 04:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
looking at this very quickly page 21
 
04:22:47.570 --> 04:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:49.729 --> 04:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
so surely
 
04:22:52.849 --> 04:22:52.859 align:start position:0%
um we can you know things like these are
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
things I would have addressed if we had
 
04:22:56.330 --> 04:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
just repealed everything
 
04:22:57.969 --> 04:22:57.979 align:start position:0%
and not I had this kind of like
 
04:23:00.110 --> 04:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
piecemeal kind of thing
 
04:23:01.969 --> 04:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
I can certainly
 
04:23:01.979 --> 04:23:03.229 align:start position:0%
I can certainly
um

04:23:03.229 --> 04:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
let's I'm looking at this page that we
 
04:23:07.670 --> 04:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
just handed to me
 
04:23:10.429 --> 04:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
things like
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
athlete agents
 
04:23:12.600 --> 04:23:15.050 align:start position:0%
athlete agents
Auctioneers

04:23:15.050 --> 04:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
Auctioneers
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.439 --> 04:23:20.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:21.830 --> 04:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want to interrupt you
 
04:23:23.630 --> 04:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
representing quota but I thought maybe
 
04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire could finish with
 
04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.050 --> 04:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
right so so there are
 
04:23:37.689 --> 04:23:37.699 align:start position:0%
some there are two or three or four
 
04:23:41.450 --> 04:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
repeals straight repeals still in this
 
04:23:43.729 --> 04:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
all right but the ones you were
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
mentioning boxing etc those are not
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
repeals those are movements from
 
04:23:51.650 --> 04:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State to
 
04:23:54.349 --> 04:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
um oplc yes right and then those
 
04:23:56.030 --> 04:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
arrangements appear
 
04:23:58.610 --> 04:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
appear to be well within the governor's
 
04:24:02.450 --> 04:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we know the uh secretary
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
of state has not objected to that yeah
 
04:24:06.769 --> 04:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
he testified before us he accepted the
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
three removals exactly and the oplc is
 
04:24:13.610 --> 04:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
willing to take them on the there are
 
04:24:16.969 --> 04:24:16.979 align:start position:0%
almost no changes in the statutes that
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
are being moved over to the oplc
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
those transfers don't delete any
 
04:24:22.439 --> 04:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
those transfers don't delete any
licenses

04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
they just transfer the administrative
 
04:24:30.410 --> 04:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
attachment of those boards
 
04:24:32.929 --> 04:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
all right representative Dia McGuire you
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
like to continue so so in terms of the
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
actual removal of licenses on people
 
04:24:45.189 --> 04:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
there are I believe three left in this
 
04:24:49.610 --> 04:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
the athlete agents of which there's a
 
04:24:52.450 --> 04:24:52.460 align:start position:0%
very tiny number I don't think there's
 
04:24:55.610 --> 04:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
anyways the athlete agents the Hawkers
 
04:24:59.330 --> 04:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
and Peddlers and the itinerant vendors
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
two of those are currently
 
04:25:02.880 --> 04:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
two of those are currently
um

04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
attached to the Secretary of State so
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
instead of just moving them to the oplc
 
04:25:11.870 --> 04:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
we just decided there's such a small
 
04:25:15.370 --> 04:25:15.380 align:start position:0%
thing to to let them go now
 
04:25:17.929 --> 04:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
representative grassy brought up reasons
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
why maybe we shouldn't do that and if so
 
04:25:23.570 --> 04:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
those sections could easily be deleted
 
04:25:25.729 --> 04:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
from this but they are in it and I
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
believe that's the only those are the
 
04:25:29.630 --> 04:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
only license
 
04:25:33.729 --> 04:25:33.739 align:start position:0%
eliminations in this section
 
04:25:36.290 --> 04:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
most of what's here
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
is in the nature of cleanup for example
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
um and and I'd like these others to
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but let's turn
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
to page 17 just as an example
 
04:25:56.229 --> 04:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
yes okay State licensed or certified
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisers real estate
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
appraiser board so this is a board that
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
already in law
 
04:26:08.640 --> 04:26:09.530 align:start position:0%
already in law
um

04:26:09.530 --> 04:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:11.990 --> 04:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
well no this is a board which is now in
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office right
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
and it's being moved it's in the dra
 
04:26:20.450 --> 04:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
we partially moved it from the dra last
 
04:26:24.290 --> 04:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
year the the real estate appraisers and
 
04:26:27.070 --> 04:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
the assessing cert and the assessors
 
04:26:31.130 --> 04:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
were in the dra we moved them last year
 
04:26:33.530 --> 04:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
but it appears that we didn't
 
04:26:35.570 --> 04:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
we weren't as thorough as we would have
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
liked and we need some cleanup that's
 
04:26:41.210 --> 04:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
the uh the first section on the
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
certification board and this on the uh
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisers are our cleanup
 
04:26:51.290 --> 04:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
it does not delete any licenses or
 
04:26:53.809 --> 04:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
change any requirements to be an
 
04:26:56.929 --> 04:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
assessor or a real estate appraiser
 
04:26:59.870 --> 04:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
right but one thing it does do and and
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
this is where we defaulted to the
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
governor in several cases notice it
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
makes the board on line 19 five members
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
instead of seven
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
so the governor is the person who's
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
appointing these people has trouble
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
finding them
 
04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
Etc and so it deletes the banking
 
04:27:18.710 --> 04:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
executive director and makes it one
 
04:27:22.010 --> 04:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
member of the public instead of two
 
04:27:22.020 --> 04:27:22.910 align:start position:0%
member of the public instead of two
um

04:27:22.910 --> 04:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:25.010 --> 04:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
but still the same three real estate
 
04:27:29.210 --> 04:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
appraisers yeah the same license Etc now
 
04:27:31.969 --> 04:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
look on page 18 this is another thing
 
04:27:34.969 --> 04:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of changes similar to
 
04:27:37.370 --> 04:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
this on line two
 
04:27:39.649 --> 04:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
so this says the board shall meet at
 
04:27:42.769 --> 04:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
least once each calendar Corridor
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and and you must have four members of
 
04:27:47.689 --> 04:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
the board present you know Quorum kind
 
04:27:50.950 --> 04:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
of thing so a lot of
 
04:27:54.290 --> 04:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
these smaller less active boards have
 
04:27:57.769 --> 04:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
trouble meeting that often that's
 
04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
specified in law of trouble finding
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
quorums and things like that so there's
 
04:28:04.610 --> 04:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
a number of places in this bill where
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
these kind of requirements to meet at a
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
certain you know we have one board they
 
04:28:12.290 --> 04:28:12.300 align:start position:0%
haven't met since 2019 for example you
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
know so
 
04:28:15.889 --> 04:28:15.899 align:start position:0%
and they're required by law to meet
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
every quarter or something you know so
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're taking away some of those kind of
 
04:28:20.880 --> 04:28:22.490 align:start position:0%
we're taking away some of those kind of
requirements

04:28:22.490 --> 04:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:28:24.110 --> 04:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
and that's what that's what's going on
 
04:28:24.120 --> 04:28:25.790 align:start position:0%
and that's what that's what's going on
here

04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
so these are really in my mind are just
 
04:28:32.750 --> 04:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
sensible cleanup type of things with the
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
possible exception of the four of those
 
04:28:39.530 --> 04:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
three licenses that are being eliminated
 
04:28:41.870 --> 04:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention that there is a
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
deletion of the board of Allied health
 
04:28:48.010 --> 04:28:48.020 align:start position:0%
professionals that is a composite board
 
04:28:51.710 --> 04:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
each individual profession involved
 
04:28:55.490 --> 04:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
has an Advisory Board and
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's suggestion is to
 
04:29:01.070 --> 04:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate the
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
the combined board
 
04:29:05.689 --> 04:29:05.699 align:start position:0%
and let the advisory boards talk
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
directly to the oplc
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
so it eliminates one layer of
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy it does not eliminate any
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
licenses it doesn't change the
 
04:29:18.229 --> 04:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
requirements for any licenses
 
04:29:21.769 --> 04:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
and so there's a
 
04:29:25.130 --> 04:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
a few cases where responsibilities that
 
04:29:27.769 --> 04:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
were on the board of Allied Health are
 
04:29:31.130 --> 04:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
now flowed down to the discrete boards
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
the genetic counselors have a few words
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
and so do the uh
 
04:29:39.410 --> 04:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh Recreation therapist I think it is
 
04:29:39.420 --> 04:29:41.149 align:start position:0%
uh Recreation therapist I think it is
yeah

04:29:41.149 --> 04:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make comment because
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
the board wasn't consulted I think that
 
04:29:47.929 --> 04:29:47.939 align:start position:0%
we should discuss this with them and
 
04:29:50.090 --> 04:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
also the Ally the professional Allied
 
04:29:51.769 --> 04:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
Health Board is the board that does
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
comes Justified before our committee so
 
04:29:56.750 --> 04:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want to chop off somebody who's
 
04:29:59.929 --> 04:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
willing to give us feedback right
 
04:30:02.689 --> 04:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:30:05.149 --> 04:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this in this part where
 
04:30:07.309 --> 04:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
the electrician the electrician part
 
04:30:09.530 --> 04:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
which is not you know this eliminates
 
04:30:14.269 --> 04:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
the um uh the inspectors will now be in
 
04:30:15.769 --> 04:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
charge will be will be the
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the inspectors will
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
now be in in the under the direction of
 
04:30:22.490 --> 04:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
oplc as opposed to the board and that's
 
04:30:24.530 --> 04:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
not really a cleanup in my mind that's a
 
04:30:26.330 --> 04:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
change I don't have an issue with the
 
04:30:29.570 --> 04:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
military experience but you know it's
 
04:30:31.250 --> 04:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:30:31.260 --> 04:30:31.910 align:start position:0%
sort of
um

04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:34.010 --> 04:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
not that there was a significant amount
 
04:30:36.170 --> 04:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
of work to do this but some of this
 
04:30:38.269 --> 04:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
stuff is like easy for us to put
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
together rather than hashing this out
 
04:30:44.450 --> 04:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm deboning a chicken
 
04:30:46.849 --> 04:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
that's already been eaten you know what
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
I mean isn't that terrible analogy but
 
04:30:49.790 --> 04:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing I can think of at
 
04:30:51.429 --> 04:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
the particular minute
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
could you point to the section and page
 
04:30:56.990 --> 04:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about
 
04:30:59.090 --> 04:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
um on this amendment on this piece of
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
paper here it's a one page 126 sections
 
04:31:07.010 --> 04:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
353 to 356.
 
04:31:07.020 --> 04:31:09.349 align:start position:0%
353 to 356.
okay

04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
so in the big document which is the one
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
that I
 
04:31:15.769 --> 04:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
I haven't this little document I haven't
 
04:31:18.050 --> 04:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
seen before
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
no I was looking for it in the McGuire
 
04:31:22.610 --> 04:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment but he's oh okay I'm searched
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:35.330 --> 04:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
right online thank you online 33.
 
04:31:44.689 --> 04:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
so instead of having the inspectors
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
being under the power of the board
 
04:31:50.689 --> 04:31:50.699 align:start position:0%
they're now under the power of oplc
 
04:31:50.699 --> 04:31:52.309 align:start position:0%
they're now under the power of oplc
and

04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is you know a change that hasn't
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
really been discussed with the board of
 
04:31:57.889 --> 04:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
electricians and I think that this is
 
04:32:00.110 --> 04:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
something that electrical inspectors are
 
04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
rather important and it's not that we
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't have expertise in that but what is
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
that what are the implications of that
 
04:32:08.450 --> 04:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
and what are the you know when we send
 
04:32:10.849 --> 04:32:10.859 align:start position:0%
in someone to do the work to do the
 
04:32:13.550 --> 04:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
overseeing we really I would want to
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
have input from the electricians on this
 
04:32:21.050 --> 04:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:23.330 --> 04:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire any
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that the electrical
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
um we've already said that the oplc has
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
an office of INSP the inspectors work
 
04:32:33.530 --> 04:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
for the oplc
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
and their
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh they are required to be licensed
 
04:32:41.809 --> 04:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
electricians not we don't see that here
 
04:32:43.729 --> 04:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
but they are required to be licensed
 
04:32:46.750 --> 04:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
electricians and
 
04:32:50.689 --> 04:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
meet other qualifications like
 
04:32:53.090 --> 04:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
being able to travel around and so forth
 
04:32:57.290 --> 04:32:57.300 align:start position:0%
but the uh this just this just says that
 
04:33:04.810 --> 04:33:04.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:07.609 --> 04:33:07.619 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm a picky person when it comes
 
04:33:08.929 --> 04:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
to words
 
04:33:11.330 --> 04:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
because empower
 
04:33:16.070 --> 04:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative grass yeah this
 
04:33:19.250 --> 04:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
electrician section I was digging
 
04:33:20.209 --> 04:33:20.219 align:start position:0%
through looking for it I mean there's
 
04:33:21.769 --> 04:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
just so much here and I finally found it
 
04:33:22.970 --> 04:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
when you started talking about it as
 
04:33:24.410 --> 04:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
well something that was someone
 
04:33:25.609 --> 04:33:25.619 align:start position:0%
approached me in the hallway as well
 
04:33:27.529 --> 04:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
they have significant concerns about
 
04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
this the electrician section I mean for
 
04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
the most part here I'm I don't have a
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
lot of problems a lot of it when
 
04:33:36.650 --> 04:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire originally
 
04:33:38.631 --> 04:33:38.641 align:start position:0%
presented this amendment I thought this
 
04:33:41.631 --> 04:33:41.641 align:start position:0%
was a good idea but as you know as we
 
04:33:43.730 --> 04:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
get into the the detail of nitty-gritty
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
here we're finding little things which
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
could come back to bite us you know it's
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
the same thing I said with the Hawkers
 
04:33:51.529 --> 04:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
and Peddler's license you know you can
 
04:33:52.970 --> 04:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
get rid of it I'm not going to oppose
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
that but I'll tell you the unintended
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
consequences may be worse than what
 
04:33:58.010 --> 04:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
you're looking for
 
04:34:00.650 --> 04:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and uh but you know this is one that
 
04:34:02.810 --> 04:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
I think maybe if we wanted to take one
 
04:34:05.209 --> 04:34:05.219 align:start position:0%
out and hold it this needs I think it
 
04:34:06.349 --> 04:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
needs a little more research here
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
because there were some things that were
 
04:34:09.890 --> 04:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
presented to me through their their
 
04:34:13.789 --> 04:34:13.799 align:start position:0%
lobbyist that that concerned me as far
 
04:34:15.289 --> 04:34:15.299 align:start position:0%
as supervision of electricians are
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
concerned and how this could impact
 
04:34:20.209 --> 04:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
electricians overall and
 
04:34:21.890 --> 04:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
um you know it may end up that we do
 
04:34:24.170 --> 04:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
nothing we not change this but this is a
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
lot to try to you know to try to take in
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:34.010 --> 04:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to suggest that instead of
 
04:34:36.890 --> 04:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
jumping from you know page seven into 17
 
04:34:38.650 --> 04:34:38.660 align:start position:0%
we'll just start right at the beginning
 
04:34:40.730 --> 04:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things that I've
 
04:34:42.051 --> 04:34:42.061 align:start position:0%
already scanned through I don't see a
 
04:34:43.369 --> 04:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
problem with but I think if
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is start on page
 
04:34:50.631 --> 04:34:50.641 align:start position:0%
one like with the assessing
 
04:34:52.970 --> 04:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
section which I was looking at over
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
didn't seem problematic but just go
 
04:34:59.090 --> 04:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
through perhaps as rapidly as you could
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
shall we uh defer to the other
 
04:35:04.609 --> 04:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire perhaps thank you
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
for for this kind of detail
 
04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah the assessing the successing
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
certified certification board is
 
04:35:15.289 --> 04:35:15.299 align:start position:0%
currently in in with the dra
 
04:35:19.310 --> 04:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
all right last year we passed a bill to
 
04:35:22.730 --> 04:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
separate the assessing certification
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
board which certifies assessors from the
 
04:35:29.090 --> 04:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
assessing Standards Board which sets up
 
04:35:32.209 --> 04:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
the requirements for
 
04:35:32.219 --> 04:35:33.709 align:start position:0%
the requirements for
um

04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:36.970 --> 04:35:36.980 align:start position:0%
four assessors including dra assessors
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
and this
 
04:35:39.240 --> 04:35:41.090 align:start position:0%
and this
is

04:35:41.090 --> 04:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
as I said it's a bit of cleanup we want
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
to move the assessing certification
 
04:35:48.769 --> 04:35:48.779 align:start position:0%
board which licenses individual
 
04:35:48.779 --> 04:35:50.570 align:start position:0%
board which licenses individual
assessors

04:35:50.570 --> 04:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
assessors
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
to the oplc
 
04:35:55.570 --> 04:35:55.580 align:start position:0%
the assessing Standards Board is still
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
associated with the dra because that's
 
04:36:03.949 --> 04:36:03.959 align:start position:0%
they do the equalization manual they and
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
various other things that the dra is
 
04:36:09.410 --> 04:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:12.590 --> 04:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
all right moving right along and
 
04:36:15.369 --> 04:36:15.379 align:start position:0%
I'm listening okay and this is a uh
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
auctioneers the auctioneers are moving
 
04:36:22.609 --> 04:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
applications just repealed okay wait
 
04:36:24.349 --> 04:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
wait wait wait no no but I I've asked
 
04:36:27.369 --> 04:36:27.379 align:start position:0%
these agents I saw a number down here
 
04:36:30.590 --> 04:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
online page two line five repeal athlete
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
I just process wise so if we're let's
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
just say all right are we okay with
 
04:36:40.269 --> 04:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
these sections regarding the assessing
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
certification board so that would take
 
04:36:45.349 --> 04:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
us from one to
 
04:36:48.529 --> 04:36:48.539 align:start position:0%
what one through four section four right
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
no one sections one through four okay so
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to take notes and
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
then we don't have to go back
 
04:36:58.730 --> 04:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
okay sections one two four we're okay
 
04:37:01.970 --> 04:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
all right all right so now we're on six
 
04:37:05.449 --> 04:37:05.459 align:start position:0%
five five five five is a one-line repeal
 
04:37:06.609 --> 04:37:06.619 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
registration of athlete agents
 
04:37:09.719 --> 04:37:10.910 align:start position:0%
registration of athlete agents
okay

04:37:10.910 --> 04:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:10.920 --> 04:37:13.131 align:start position:0%
okay
good

04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:37:15.349 --> 04:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
so now we're to Auctioneer line six
 
04:37:18.010 --> 04:37:18.020 align:start position:0%
transfers the State Board of auctioneers
 
04:37:22.189 --> 04:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State's office to
 
04:37:24.410 --> 04:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
04:37:28.131 --> 04:37:28.141 align:start position:0%
with the consent of both parties
 
04:37:30.051 --> 04:37:30.061 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change any of the
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
requirements for an auctioneer
 
04:37:36.289 --> 04:37:36.299 align:start position:0%
it ensures their current rules remain in
 
04:37:39.369 --> 04:37:39.379 align:start position:0%
effect unless changed
 
04:37:41.631 --> 04:37:41.641 align:start position:0%
and we heard from the secretary of state
 
04:37:44.810 --> 04:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
that he is fine and that goes that's
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
through and 12 uh through set through
 
04:37:47.820 --> 04:37:50.929 align:start position:0%
through and 12 uh through set through
11.

04:37:50.929 --> 04:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:56.570 --> 04:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:56.580 --> 04:37:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
12 is the deletion of the
 
04:38:05.570 --> 04:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
Allied Health
 
04:38:05.580 --> 04:38:07.849 align:start position:0%
Allied Health
board

04:38:07.849 --> 04:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:38:11.390 --> 04:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
while maintaining the governing Boards
 
04:38:15.051 --> 04:38:15.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair
 
04:38:17.039 --> 04:38:18.830 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair
um

04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:21.051 --> 04:38:21.061 align:start position:0%
I actually sought the input of the
 
04:38:22.609 --> 04:38:22.619 align:start position:0%
national I mean the New Hampshire
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association and I see Paula is
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
back there
 
04:38:31.609 --> 04:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
I my understanding from the in do you
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
oh I don't know
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
yeah the the at the moment there is a
 
04:38:44.570 --> 04:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
governing board where the
 
04:38:46.730 --> 04:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
the governing Boards of the individual
 
04:38:49.369 --> 04:38:49.379 align:start position:0%
professions get together as the board of
 
04:38:51.051 --> 04:38:51.061 align:start position:0%
Allied Health
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
and this eliminates that extra layer of
 
04:38:54.480 --> 04:38:55.730 align:start position:0%
and this eliminates that extra layer of
bureaucracy

04:38:55.730 --> 04:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
 
04:38:57.650 --> 04:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change doesn't delete any
 
04:38:59.689 --> 04:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
licenses doesn't change any of their
 
04:39:01.631 --> 04:39:01.641 align:start position:0%
requirements for any of the professions
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
it maintains the separate governing
 
04:39:11.449 --> 04:39:11.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.570 --> 04:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
so thank you so let's ask representative
 
04:39:18.590 --> 04:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
groda is she okay not so okay what do
 
04:39:24.349 --> 04:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.570 --> 04:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
it's fun okay okay I'll go let's go and
 
04:39:29.209 --> 04:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
see how we do with the others yeah going
 
04:39:31.609 --> 04:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
on with the Allied Health it they uh
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
each governing board has
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
um rulemaking Authority criminal record
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
checks that's mostly just language
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
cleanup there on the recreational
 
04:39:42.718 --> 04:39:44.550 align:start position:0%
cleanup there on the recreational
therapist

04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
04:39:44.560 --> 04:39:45.288 align:start position:0%
therapist
[Music]

04:39:45.288 --> 04:39:45.298 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:39:45.298 --> 04:39:48.130 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:39:48.130 --> 04:39:48.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:51.890 --> 04:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
conditions imposed yeah that's it simply
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
says that what the what the uh
 
04:39:55.200 --> 04:39:57.890 align:start position:0%
says that what the what the uh
license

04:39:57.890 --> 04:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:39:59.750 --> 04:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
conditions are
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:07.850 --> 04:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
it deletes a reference to the board of
 
04:40:07.860 --> 04:40:09.050 align:start position:0%
it deletes a reference to the board of
um

04:40:09.050 --> 04:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:16.130 --> 04:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair well just while representative
 
04:40:21.708 --> 04:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
grottis thinking about Allied Health
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh Paula do you could you give us your
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
view on why you think it's all right if
 
04:40:31.270 --> 04:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
the Allied Health Board no longer exists
 
04:40:33.530 --> 04:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'll just be a second actually I'm just
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:40:38.690 --> 04:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association thank you I it's
 
04:40:40.730 --> 04:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
because of what representative McGuire
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
said it is an extra layer is the way we
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
we agree with her that it's an extra
 
04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
layer and it does not affect the
 
04:40:51.650 --> 04:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
individual board's um Effectiveness um
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
so it it removes that extra layer of
 
04:40:57.730 --> 04:40:57.740 align:start position:0%
redundancy I guess right
 
04:41:01.010 --> 04:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
why was it created in the first place
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
question uh because yeah I I don't
 
04:41:07.250 --> 04:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
recall it was because the individual
 
04:41:10.130 --> 04:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
professions didn't have enough members
 
04:41:13.550 --> 04:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
to justify a board of the structure of
 
04:41:15.410 --> 04:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
say the Board of Nursing
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
and so they were grouped together into
 
04:41:18.600 --> 04:41:20.930 align:start position:0%
and so they were grouped together into
this

04:41:20.930 --> 04:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:41:20.940 --> 04:41:22.190 align:start position:0%
this
um

04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:24.530 --> 04:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
you know the the to make it more
 
04:41:26.930 --> 04:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
convenient more more efficient
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
because there wasn't an oplc the
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
the board of of Allied Health did the
 
04:41:37.970 --> 04:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
things that the oplc is now taking over
 
04:41:41.448 --> 04:41:41.458 align:start position:0%
such as administrative duties processing
 
04:41:47.208 --> 04:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
I have a question about this so if we
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at page five
 
04:41:56.708 --> 04:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
line 27 repealing of disciplinary
 
04:41:59.690 --> 04:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
history but there's is there any who is
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
who would maintain the disciplinary
 
04:42:03.708 --> 04:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
Authority within would it stay within
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
the boards
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
yes okay and the instead of the Allied
 
04:42:10.730 --> 04:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
Health Board being responsible for
 
04:42:12.890 --> 04:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
keeping the records the oplc is
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for keeping the records
 
04:42:17.448 --> 04:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
that's in 655. okay so I'll yield on
 
04:42:17.458 --> 04:42:18.470 align:start position:0%
that's in 655. okay so I'll yield on
that

04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
17 is the boxing and wrestling
 
04:42:27.480 --> 04:42:29.150 align:start position:0%
17 is the boxing and wrestling
Commission

04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
you know it says could she could she
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
reference page and line number I did
 
04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
find that one but I had troubles finding
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
the last one okay on page six line six
 
04:42:41.690 --> 04:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:44.690 --> 04:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
transfer first the boxing and wrestling
 
04:42:46.490 --> 04:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
commission from the
 
04:42:49.730 --> 04:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
well at the moment it's untethered last
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
year we repealed its connection to the
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and didn't actually
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
attach it anywhere else
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
so this attaches it to the to the oplc
 
04:43:02.638 --> 04:43:04.910 align:start position:0%
so this attaches it to the to the oplc
with

04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:43:04.920 --> 04:43:05.930 align:start position:0%
with
um

04:43:05.930 --> 04:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:09.050 --> 04:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
almost no changes except that the except
 
04:43:10.850 --> 04:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
the fee issues
 
04:43:12.890 --> 04:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
04:43:15.530 --> 04:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative Dan McGuire yeah notice
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
on line 12 there the governor is
 
04:43:21.830 --> 04:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
actually making the board bigger not
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
smaller it's making it five members
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
board is busier than he thought and they
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
are all um
 
04:43:35.868 --> 04:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
it's also a very profitable board for
 
04:43:39.170 --> 04:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
some reason and the
 
04:43:42.350 --> 04:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the
 
04:43:46.368 --> 04:43:46.378 align:start position:0%
um the fees do not go to the oplc except
 
04:43:48.430 --> 04:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
a five percent
 
04:43:52.730 --> 04:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
as specified in a different RSA all the
 
04:43:56.330 --> 04:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
other fees go to the go to the general
 
04:43:56.340 --> 04:43:57.770 align:start position:0%
other fees go to the go to the general
fund

04:43:57.770 --> 04:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:43:59.448 --> 04:43:59.458 align:start position:0%
well I was just going to say I think
 
04:44:01.490 --> 04:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's because mixed martial arts has
 
04:44:03.650 --> 04:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
become so popular I think that's what's
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
going on that's mixed martial arts are
 
04:44:07.610 --> 04:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
definitely part of the boxing and
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:17.930 --> 04:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
correct and starting on page 7 26
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:43.910 --> 04:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're at the bottom of page seven line
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
27 starts section 26 which is
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
electricians it defines a journeyman
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
electrician and says that they're
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
employed by a master electrician
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
which is the normal
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
any comments members some electricians
 
04:45:11.270 --> 04:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
it looks okay representing grota you
 
04:45:13.368 --> 04:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
mean electricians as a whole
 
04:45:15.890 --> 04:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
as far as this section oh that's fine
 
04:45:24.890 --> 04:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:29.868 --> 04:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:34.570 --> 04:45:34.580 align:start position:0%
it's actually okay 26 to 29. I mean
 
04:45:36.530 --> 04:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative grassy do you have
 
04:45:39.050 --> 04:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
anything to add on that or no okay
 
04:45:45.948 --> 04:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
30 genetic counseling section 30 is the
 
04:45:52.850 --> 04:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
genetic counselors they the genetic
 
04:45:54.650 --> 04:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
counselors were added to the Allied
 
04:45:56.690 --> 04:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
Health Board
 
04:45:58.850 --> 04:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
for no particular reason as far as I can
 
04:46:00.288 --> 04:46:00.298 align:start position:0%
tell except there were only a few of
 
04:46:01.850 --> 04:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
them at the time
 
04:46:07.250 --> 04:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
so this just adds in the uh changes this
 
04:46:09.590 --> 04:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
is your editorial comments about
 
04:46:11.628 --> 04:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
provisional licenses and conditional
 
04:46:15.770 --> 04:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
licenses which are already in statute
 
04:46:15.780 --> 04:46:17.628 align:start position:0%
licenses which are already in statute
um

04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:20.930 --> 04:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
privilege country yeah okay it maintains
 
04:46:20.940 --> 04:46:22.430 align:start position:0%
privilege country yeah okay it maintains
the

04:46:22.430 --> 04:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:22.440 --> 04:46:23.930 align:start position:0%
the
uh

04:46:23.930 --> 04:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:46:26.630 --> 04:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
privileged Communications and
 
04:46:26.640 --> 04:46:27.530 align:start position:0%
privileged Communications and
[Music]

04:46:27.530 --> 04:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:46:27.540 --> 04:46:31.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:46:31.270 --> 04:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:35.330 --> 04:46:35.340 align:start position:0%
repeals reciprocity because we passed
 
04:46:37.670 --> 04:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
reciprocity if the
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
requirements are that are essentially
 
04:46:43.610 --> 04:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
the same as ours in House Bill 594 just
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
this week
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
do I have the last week now
 
04:46:54.410 --> 04:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:57.530 --> 04:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
apparently yes all right continuing on
 
04:47:01.550 --> 04:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
page nine lines 11 and 12 are sections
 
04:47:05.390 --> 04:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
34 and 35.
 
04:47:05.400 --> 04:47:06.670 align:start position:0%
34 and 35.
um

04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
repeals the Hawker and Peddler's license
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
in the vendor's license
 
04:47:12.680 --> 04:47:14.270 align:start position:0%
in the vendor's license
and

04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
those are currently attached to the
 
04:47:18.050 --> 04:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
the only thing I will mention about
 
04:47:23.750 --> 04:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
those licenses is that last year when we
 
04:47:27.170 --> 04:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
passed a repeal of those two sections
 
04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
we were informed that although the
 
04:47:33.350 --> 04:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State requires a
 
04:47:35.930 --> 04:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
a criminal record check for this at some
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
statute they have never
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
in the 20 odd years I've probably 30 odd
 
04:47:44.930 --> 04:47:44.940 align:start position:0%
years that that Mr Scanlon has been in
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
the office rejected a person because of
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
their criminal record
 
04:47:51.948 --> 04:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
they get it but they don't reject
 
04:47:54.948 --> 04:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
anybody from it and they have never in
 
04:47:57.110 --> 04:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
the history of the office paid out on
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
the required Bond
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I would say that this license is an
 
04:48:04.970 --> 04:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
exercise in futility if you have to get
 
04:48:07.368 --> 04:48:07.378 align:start position:0%
a criminal check that doesn't disqualify
 
04:48:09.770 --> 04:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
you as far as I can tell and you have to
 
04:48:11.810 --> 04:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
put up a bond that
 
04:48:14.448 --> 04:48:14.458 align:start position:0%
you'll get back
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
when you leave the business
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
represent camberells thank you Mr chair
 
04:48:23.628 --> 04:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh representative McGuire uh
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative grassy brought up I I
 
04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
want to get rid of this like what a
 
04:48:29.570 --> 04:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
passion to get rid of the Peddler's Hawk
 
04:48:31.850 --> 04:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
but I have a concern uh the
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative grassy brought up
 
04:48:33.480 --> 04:48:34.970 align:start position:0%
representative grassy brought up
yesterday

04:48:34.970 --> 04:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:48:37.250 --> 04:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
um my reason for getting rid of it is I
 
04:48:38.990 --> 04:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
thought if we get rid of it at the state
 
04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
level this RSA the towns cannot then
 
04:48:42.718 --> 04:48:44.448 align:start position:0%
level this RSA the towns cannot then
require

04:48:44.448 --> 04:48:44.458 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:48:46.070 --> 04:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
um Peddler and Hawkers because they
 
04:48:50.570 --> 04:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
cannot refer to this RSA so no the towns
 
04:48:54.050 --> 04:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
and cities have a separate statutory
 
04:48:56.510 --> 04:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
authority to require a license if they
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
so choose and we they actually have a
 
04:49:01.910 --> 04:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive list of
 
04:49:03.948 --> 04:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
things they can demand including
 
04:49:05.930 --> 04:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks that they
 
04:49:09.288 --> 04:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
presumably look harder at and
 
04:49:11.690 --> 04:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
um right I don't know if they put choir
 
04:49:13.310 --> 04:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
references but they might be able to
 
04:49:16.010 --> 04:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
okay so have they have full authority to
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
license people working in their tax okay
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
so my question then is so having said
 
04:49:23.628 --> 04:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
that if I were to go to the secretary of
 
04:49:25.128 --> 04:49:25.138 align:start position:0%
state right now and get a Peddler's
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
license would it be it's active for like
 
04:49:30.170 --> 04:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
a year we'll say yeah or I believe it's
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
free okay would that then
 
04:49:34.610 --> 04:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
um allow me not to have to get it from
 
04:49:35.448 --> 04:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
the town
 
04:49:38.330 --> 04:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
no okay so if that's the case and if the
 
04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
town has requirements they are in
 
04:49:40.320 --> 04:49:43.430 align:start position:0%
town has requirements they are in
addition

04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.410 --> 04:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay so that being you are working from
 
04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
town to town you would have to get a
 
04:49:49.610 --> 04:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
separate license from each town that
 
04:49:52.010 --> 04:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
requires it right so that being the case
 
04:49:54.530 --> 04:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
this doesn't protect me from the town so
 
04:49:57.948 --> 04:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
I would repeal it I'd get rid of it yeah
 
04:50:02.030 --> 04:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
the larger towns including uh I think is
 
04:50:04.448 --> 04:50:04.458 align:start position:0%
London London Dairy Dairy
 
04:50:09.288 --> 04:50:09.298 align:start position:0%
Manchester Salem Etc have specific
 
04:50:12.050 --> 04:50:12.060 align:start position:0%
licenses for Hawkers and Peddlers in in
 
04:50:15.530 --> 04:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
their in their within their town I don't
 
04:50:28.128 --> 04:50:28.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:28.138 --> 04:50:29.708 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:50:29.708 --> 04:50:29.718 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:50:33.368 --> 04:50:33.378 align:start position:0%
section 36 which continues on page nine
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
repeals the board of manufactured
 
04:50:36.000 --> 04:50:37.550 align:start position:0%
repeals the board of manufactured
housing

04:50:37.550 --> 04:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:50:40.610 --> 04:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
04:50:43.368 --> 04:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
which is not a quality board it is
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
essentially a place for for landlord
 
04:50:48.770 --> 04:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
tenant disputes between the owners of
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
the park and the tenants
 
04:50:54.530 --> 04:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
they have not decided on anything since
 
04:50:54.540 --> 04:50:57.170 align:start position:0%
they have not decided on anything since
2019.

04:50:57.170 --> 04:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
2019.
 
04:50:59.750 --> 04:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
they haven't met in uh
 
04:51:03.890 --> 04:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
quite a while and they shared
 
04:51:06.970 --> 04:51:06.980 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction with the attorney general
 
04:51:10.730 --> 04:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
and the consumer complaints issues so
 
04:51:15.530 --> 04:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
yeah oh no no that's uh it's not on the
 
04:51:20.690 --> 04:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
sheets sorry about that it's on the
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.390 --> 04:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
I had to had to look into because I've
 
04:51:27.770 --> 04:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
never heard of it
 
04:51:30.650 --> 04:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it's inactive is a
 
04:51:32.330 --> 04:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
good reason why we've never heard of it
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't issue any licenses
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a
 
04:51:47.288 --> 04:51:47.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:50.810 --> 04:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
okay Fire Control this this is the
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing board which is
 
04:51:58.430 --> 04:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
plumbers gas Fitters and such like it is
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.718 --> 04:52:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
not the office it's under the fire
 
04:52:07.680 --> 04:52:09.410 align:start position:0%
not the office it's under the fire
marshal

04:52:09.410 --> 04:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
marshal
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
not the oplc it's not being moved
 
04:52:14.400 --> 04:52:15.350 align:start position:0%
not the oplc it's not being moved
um

04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's big enough
 
04:52:19.128 --> 04:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
you're taking away the sentence about
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
the secretary yeah well that's that one
 
04:52:25.550 --> 04:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
sentence right yeah it's a little clean
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
up here and there
 
04:52:27.718 --> 04:52:29.930 align:start position:0%
up here and there
um

04:52:29.930 --> 04:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:31.970 --> 04:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
technical laws
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
it changes the structure of the board a
 
04:52:37.010 --> 04:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
bit by deleting
 
04:52:37.020 --> 04:52:38.930 align:start position:0%
bit by deleting
um

04:52:38.930 --> 04:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
let's say they do
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
two two plumbers one which goes from two
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
to one gas fitter
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
one hurt heating equipment installer
 
04:52:51.288 --> 04:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
delete the master plumber who's also a
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
fuel gas fitter
 
04:52:58.010 --> 04:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
it deletes the need for regular meetings
 
04:53:01.320 --> 04:53:02.448 align:start position:0%
it deletes the need for regular meetings
Etc

04:53:02.448 --> 04:53:02.458 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.480 --> 04:53:10.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:13.128 --> 04:53:13.138 align:start position:0%
no no the uh
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
no that's uh We've we've we've been
 
04:53:19.190 --> 04:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
tweaking this section for a while and I
 
04:53:20.810 --> 04:53:20.820 align:start position:0%
think that I don't have any issue with
 
04:53:20.820 --> 04:53:25.128 align:start position:0%
think that I don't have any issue with
these

04:53:25.128 --> 04:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:28.250 --> 04:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
right on page 11 section 39 is the
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
in this case it's decreasing the members
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:41.208 --> 04:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
four of whom are pharmacists
 
04:53:43.550 --> 04:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
oh that's a type at least one of whom is
 
04:53:45.890 --> 04:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
a full-time Hospital pharmacist it
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
should be one and not two because there
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
are relatively few full-time Hospital
 
04:53:50.520 --> 04:53:52.788 align:start position:0%
are relatively few full-time Hospital
pharmacists

04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
pharmacists
 
04:53:57.050 --> 04:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:58.670 --> 04:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
so would you like us to make an
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment leave the at
 
04:54:04.910 --> 04:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
least one there that's that would
 
04:54:06.770 --> 04:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
that allows you to have two if you
 
04:54:09.288 --> 04:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
happen to get two volunteers but
 
04:54:12.890 --> 04:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
uh mandating to appears to disqualify
 
04:54:16.250 --> 04:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
the regular pharmacists right so Melissa
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
is that all right the page 11 line seven
 
04:54:18.480 --> 04:54:22.850 align:start position:0%
is that all right the page 11 line seven
unchanged

04:54:22.850 --> 04:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:27.288 --> 04:54:27.298 align:start position:0%
and on the inspections it gives the
 
04:54:27.298 --> 04:54:28.570 align:start position:0%
and on the inspections it gives the
board

04:54:28.570 --> 04:54:28.580 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:54:31.368 --> 04:54:31.378 align:start position:0%
Authority for the standards for
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
inspection which are technical what they
 
04:54:36.050 --> 04:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
what the inspector should look for what
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
the criteria are and not necessarily the
 
04:54:43.730 --> 04:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:43.740 --> 04:54:45.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:54:45.650 --> 04:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
the standards are more important and
 
04:54:49.490 --> 04:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what the board has the
 
04:54:51.050 --> 04:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
expertise in
 
04:54:53.930 --> 04:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
the deletions are
 
04:54:53.940 --> 04:54:55.550 align:start position:0%
the deletions are
uh

04:54:55.550 --> 04:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
consult are part of the consolidation of
 
04:55:02.270 --> 04:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings and so forth
 
04:55:02.280 --> 04:55:03.350 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearings and so forth
um

04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:09.650 --> 04:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
Inspection Services the oplc will
 
04:55:15.410 --> 04:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
provide Inspection Services to the other
 
04:55:18.350 --> 04:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
boards that have drugs
 
04:55:21.288 --> 04:55:21.298 align:start position:0%
and the board inspection shall be
 
04:55:22.970 --> 04:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
provided by pharmacists or pharmacy
 
04:55:25.070 --> 04:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
technicians licensed by the Board of
 
04:55:27.170 --> 04:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy who are training and experience
 
04:55:29.448 --> 04:55:29.458 align:start position:0%
regarding Pharmacy statutes and rules
 
04:55:32.330 --> 04:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
which sounds like exactly what who you'd
 
04:55:34.810 --> 04:55:34.820 align:start position:0%
want to be doing that
 
04:55:34.820 --> 04:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
want to be doing that
[Music]

04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:55:35.520 --> 04:55:39.470 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:55:39.470 --> 04:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:42.110 --> 04:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
all right most of the rest is just
 
04:55:44.810 --> 04:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
changing board to under the
 
04:55:46.930 --> 04:55:46.940 align:start position:0%
qualifications changing board to office
 
04:55:49.368 --> 04:55:49.378 align:start position:0%
no change in the in the actual
 
04:55:52.368 --> 04:55:52.378 align:start position:0%
requirements for a pharmacist
 
04:55:52.378 --> 04:55:53.628 align:start position:0%
requirements for a pharmacist
um

04:55:53.628 --> 04:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:59.868 --> 04:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
all the way through the impaired
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.520 --> 04:56:10.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:56:10.490 --> 04:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:10.500 --> 04:56:12.170 align:start position:0%
 
there's

04:56:12.170 --> 04:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:56:12.180 --> 04:56:15.350 align:start position:0%
there's
honesty

04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.230 --> 04:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
I look those it's it's pretty long and
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's all
 
04:56:22.310 --> 04:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
pretty minor
 
04:56:33.288 --> 04:56:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.288 --> 04:56:39.298 align:start position:0%
right on page 16 line 32
 
04:56:39.298 --> 04:56:40.910 align:start position:0%
right on page 16 line 32
um

04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:43.550 --> 04:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
physical therapy this
 
04:56:46.368 --> 04:56:46.378 align:start position:0%
adds to the powers and duties of the
 
04:56:46.378 --> 04:56:47.390 align:start position:0%
adds to the powers and duties of the
board

04:56:47.390 --> 04:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:56:50.510 --> 04:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
be because which had previously been an
 
04:56:52.610 --> 04:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
under Allied Health
 
04:56:55.490 --> 04:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
this uh puts it at the more appropriate
 
04:56:57.590 --> 04:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
level of the governing board
 
04:56:59.570 --> 04:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
except for fees the rest of it is
 
04:57:02.878 --> 04:57:04.550 align:start position:0%
except for fees the rest of it is
um

04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of the governing
 
04:57:15.050 --> 04:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
all right that's true 57 yeah
 
04:57:22.850 --> 04:57:22.860 align:start position:0%
on page 17 line 14 it starts with the
 
04:57:25.970 --> 04:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisers
 
04:57:25.980 --> 04:57:30.230 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisers
and

04:57:30.230 --> 04:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
and that that I think is part of the
 
04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:54.470 --> 04:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
those are all covered by by sections of
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
the statute with the oplc like the UN
 
04:57:58.730 --> 04:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
unlawful practice
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:07.150 --> 04:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
you say about the uh we'll be prayer
 
04:58:11.350 --> 04:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.288 --> 04:58:15.298 align:start position:0%
that's I believe the Privacy unlawful
 
04:58:17.208 --> 04:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure unlawful practice and
 
04:58:20.570 --> 04:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
reporting violations are in 655 for the
 
04:58:22.368 --> 04:58:22.378 align:start position:0%
oplc okay okay
 
04:58:24.410 --> 04:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
the rest of the real estate appraisers
 
04:58:24.420 --> 04:58:31.788 align:start position:0%
the rest of the real estate appraisers
looks

04:58:31.788 --> 04:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
right that takes us to the end
 
04:58:38.030 --> 04:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisers yeah the same
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
thing they're they're moving all right
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then line on page 22 line 26 section
 
04:58:54.650 --> 04:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
all right representative Carol McGuire
 
04:59:00.350 --> 04:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the percentage
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
I know you've done a lot of work I
 
04:59:04.128 --> 04:59:04.138 align:start position:0%
really appreciate we all do appreciate
 
04:59:05.810 --> 04:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
the efforts
 
04:59:08.810 --> 04:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh this was very helpful Melissa hi
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
um I was just going through the
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
amendment comparing it to our notes and
 
04:59:13.850 --> 04:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
there is one section that's missing that
 
04:59:15.170 --> 04:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
looks like it should be in the amendment
 
04:59:16.970 --> 04:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
which is bondsman
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
oh that's right that was Secretary of
 
04:59:21.050 --> 04:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
State too I think that's on this sheet
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
right it's on the sheet but it's not in
 
04:59:28.788 --> 04:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:41.208 --> 04:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.730 --> 04:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
if we want to look at it it's page 200
 
04:59:50.750 --> 04:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:50.760 --> 04:59:52.090 align:start position:0%
 
0

04:59:52.090 --> 04:59:52.100 align:start position:0%
0
 
04:59:52.100 --> 04:59:53.708 align:start position:0%
0
representative

04:59:53.708 --> 04:59:53.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
grassy if I may
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire uh did you on
 
05:00:02.090 --> 05:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
page 11 line seven did you say that
 
05:00:04.190 --> 05:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
leave the at least one in there on line
 
05:00:05.930 --> 05:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
seven instead of two
 
05:00:08.270 --> 05:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
so that would be the only yes at least
 
05:00:10.490 --> 05:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
one Hospital pharmacist okay so we'd
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
leave that in instead of changing it to
 
05:00:15.650 --> 05:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
two who shall be full-time sorry
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:22.490 --> 05:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
the only concern that I have is the
 
05:00:24.170 --> 05:00:24.180 align:start position:0%
electrician part
 
05:00:26.690 --> 05:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm still concerned about that part I
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to Circle back to electricians
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
folks represent grassy yeah I'm just
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
trying to recall the discussion I had
 
05:00:34.910 --> 05:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
with the lobbyist who was outside and he
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
said the concern he had was to deal with
 
05:00:38.690 --> 05:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
major corporations who have their own
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
electrical firms inside the company in
 
05:00:43.850 --> 05:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
that a lot of times you have one
 
05:00:45.288 --> 05:00:45.298 align:start position:0%
electrician who's a master electrician
 
05:00:46.610 --> 05:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
and then the other electricians who work
 
05:00:48.770 --> 05:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
for them are not necessarily licensed
 
05:00:50.090 --> 05:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
electricians and he said that some
 
05:00:52.730 --> 05:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
changes in here could impact them well
 
05:00:55.250 --> 05:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
their licensed electricians are just not
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
licensed Master electricians right so
 
05:00:59.810 --> 05:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
they were just concerned that the person
 
05:01:02.810 --> 05:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
that would be super supervising all that
 
05:01:05.810 --> 05:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
would be so someone that would be chosen
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
by oplc as a course as opposed to the
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
electrical War electricians board which
 
05:01:13.368 --> 05:01:13.378 align:start position:0%
is why that chant that's how that change
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
change that time okay you're talking
 
05:01:17.750 --> 05:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
about these
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
large organizations that have a large
 
05:01:22.330 --> 05:01:22.340 align:start position:0%
number of
 
05:01:25.128 --> 05:01:25.138 align:start position:0%
journeyman electricians which are
 
05:01:28.610 --> 05:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
licensed but
 
05:01:30.530 --> 05:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
they're not joining them in electricians
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
technically they've actually work for
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
the company so I guess they could be
 
05:01:36.010 --> 05:01:36.020 align:start position:0%
called they are not licensed Journeymen
 
05:01:38.930 --> 05:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
electricians then they can't do a great
 
05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
they can't legally do a great many
 
05:01:43.368 --> 05:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
things that I would presume they would
 
05:01:45.770 --> 05:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
wanted to do that's that's correct and
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
we have the gentleman here I guess and I
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
would say that that's
 
05:01:51.948 --> 05:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
I don't think this makes it any worse
 
05:01:54.770 --> 05:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
but that is a
 
05:01:58.250 --> 05:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
possibly this line 30 on page seven we
 
05:02:09.170 --> 05:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.110 --> 05:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's a what's this what page
 
05:02:13.970 --> 05:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
you're on page seven page seven line
 
05:02:16.730 --> 05:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
Thirty okay yeah
 
05:02:18.650 --> 05:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
and if you could please state your name
 
05:02:20.570 --> 05:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
for the record thank you uh Simon
 
05:02:22.670 --> 05:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
Thompson I'm a lobbyist machine Finney
 
05:02:24.410 --> 05:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
Capital group and the client that I was
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
talking to the representatives for is
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
the electrical contractor Business
 
05:02:31.250 --> 05:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
Association and it's specific to the
 
05:02:32.570 --> 05:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
current Amendment we're looking at page
 
05:02:36.050 --> 05:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
8 line 14.
 
05:02:39.530 --> 05:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
um RSA 319-c colon 10 relative to
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
electrician corporations and
 
05:02:40.798 --> 05:02:42.770 align:start position:0%
electrician corporations and
Partnerships

05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
Partnerships
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
and it's it is talked about prior and
 
05:02:47.628 --> 05:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
we're removing and what this amendment
 
05:02:49.730 --> 05:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
is doing is removing it my client was
 
05:02:53.208 --> 05:02:53.218 align:start position:0%
concerned with this aspect of it
 
05:02:54.890 --> 05:02:54.900 align:start position:0%
um I talked with executive director
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
Courtney uh in the hallway uh a few
 
05:03:01.190 --> 05:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
minutes ago and um basically the board
 
05:03:03.288 --> 05:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
of electricians according to director
 
05:03:03.298 --> 05:03:04.310 align:start position:0%
of electricians according to director
Courtney

05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
Courtney
 
05:03:07.550 --> 05:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
um is has a wording it says May
 
05:03:09.708 --> 05:03:09.718 align:start position:0%
instead of Xiao so director Courtney
 
05:03:11.090 --> 05:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
feels like that's a voluntary license
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
and something that she's not supportive
 
05:03:13.080 --> 05:03:14.570 align:start position:0%
and something that she's not supportive
of

05:03:14.570 --> 05:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:03:17.208 --> 05:03:17.218 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's some uh
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
miscommunication between who I've been
 
05:03:20.750 --> 05:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
speaking with in the board so I'd like
 
05:03:22.430 --> 05:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
to sort that out but I think I don't
 
05:03:24.890 --> 05:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
think that's worth yes and I'd like to
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
mention that
 
05:03:31.368 --> 05:03:31.378 align:start position:0%
this um this amendment on line 30
 
05:03:34.010 --> 05:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
deletes that exemption and it simply
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
maintains a requirement that a
 
05:03:38.750 --> 05:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
journeyman electrician shall be employed
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
by a master electrician
 
05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
so whether it's an individual or a
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
business there's a master electrician at
 
05:03:50.090 --> 05:03:50.100 align:start position:0%
the head and in fact my understanding is
 
05:03:51.890 --> 05:03:51.900 align:start position:0%
the only reason you need
 
05:03:55.490 --> 05:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
a master's license is to be able to
 
05:03:58.090 --> 05:03:58.100 align:start position:0%
be the head of the business
 
05:04:00.770 --> 05:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
the the technical abilities of the
 
05:04:03.410 --> 05:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
Journeymen are pretty much the same
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
are you all set represented thank you
 
05:04:07.448 --> 05:04:07.458 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:04:10.490 --> 05:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
05:04:12.730 --> 05:04:12.740 align:start position:0%
the that same section
 
05:04:16.070 --> 05:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
on page seven line Thirty this is
 
05:04:22.610 --> 05:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
employed by a master electrician except
 
05:04:25.730 --> 05:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
as provided in RSA 310 C10 what's that
 
05:04:29.030 --> 05:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
we just we just went through it this
 
05:04:31.670 --> 05:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
deletes that exception which would allow
 
05:04:36.110 --> 05:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that that accept is
 
05:04:41.570 --> 05:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
provided is crossed out
 
05:04:43.550 --> 05:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
right but maybe the business would like
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
that exception so they don't have to
 
05:04:48.530 --> 05:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
have a master to employ a journeyman is
 
05:04:55.610 --> 05:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:58.010 --> 05:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
let me look up the section so we can I'm
 
05:05:02.208 --> 05:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure that that the there
 
05:05:04.750 --> 05:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
there is no intention to have a
 
05:05:07.070 --> 05:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
journeyman electrician working for
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
himself because that is just not you
 
05:05:09.360 --> 05:05:10.368 align:start position:0%
himself because that is just not you
know

05:05:10.368 --> 05:05:10.378 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
this says that you shall be employed by
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
a master electrician period
 
05:05:18.410 --> 05:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
and the exemptions or whatever that
 
05:05:22.090 --> 05:05:22.100 align:start position:0%
would whatever Clauses were in
 
05:05:27.170 --> 05:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
319 C10 are no longer applicable
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's so representative Dan Maguire would
 
05:05:31.368 --> 05:05:31.378 align:start position:0%
still be allowed to put your light bulb
 
05:05:31.378 --> 05:05:32.530 align:start position:0%
still be allowed to put your light bulb
in

05:05:32.530 --> 05:05:32.540 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:05:35.150 --> 05:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
it is allowed to to change your own
 
05:05:37.310 --> 05:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
light bulb in your own business
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
in your own home
 
05:05:41.208 --> 05:05:41.218 align:start position:0%
provided of course it's a one it's a
 
05:05:45.050 --> 05:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney has a question or
 
05:05:49.250 --> 05:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
a comment
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
well I could read you this particular
 
05:05:54.590 --> 05:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
section but it it basically says the
 
05:05:56.330 --> 05:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
board can issue a license to
 
05:05:59.690 --> 05:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
corporations and Partnerships engaged in
 
05:06:02.930 --> 05:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
business of electrical installation as
 
05:06:06.050 --> 05:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
long as they have someone in their
 
05:06:09.410 --> 05:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
officers or employees who is a master
 
05:06:09.420 --> 05:06:11.208 align:start position:0%
officers or employees who is a master
electrician

05:06:11.208 --> 05:06:11.218 align:start position:0%
electrician
 
05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
so so this is a license for
 
05:06:18.590 --> 05:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:20.510 --> 05:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and what section is that
 
05:06:27.650 --> 05:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
I'm reading 310c 31 319 C colon 10 which
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
is a section that's being removed
 
05:06:33.890 --> 05:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
so basically it sounds like they no
 
05:06:36.410 --> 05:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
longer need to license
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
the company they they still would
 
05:06:40.368 --> 05:06:40.378 align:start position:0%
license the the Masters and the
 
05:06:43.490 --> 05:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
journeyman and so on so this it you know
 
05:06:50.270 --> 05:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:52.730 --> 05:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
okay the pleasure of the division with
 
05:06:56.570 --> 05:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
the electricals end of things
 
05:06:58.430 --> 05:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
we okay
 
05:06:58.440 --> 05:07:13.490 align:start position:0%
we okay
foreign

05:07:13.490 --> 05:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
believe me we talked to the electricians
 
05:07:20.208 --> 05:07:20.218 align:start position:0%
regularly and they have not expressed uh
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
any concern about this they're they're
 
05:07:23.520 --> 05:07:25.030 align:start position:0%
any concern about this they're they're
okay

05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:07:28.250 --> 05:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
yeah they were concerned about making
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
sure the inspectors were qualified which
 
05:07:34.368 --> 05:07:34.378 align:start position:0%
I believe is something that we
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
have dealt with in in 655 and if we need
 
05:07:39.948 --> 05:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
to beef up the requirements in the
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
future we'll do so but I we we have
 
05:07:44.690 --> 05:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
taken that complaint very seriously for
 
05:07:46.128 --> 05:07:46.138 align:start position:0%
that concern
 
05:07:48.050 --> 05:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Sweeney
 
05:07:50.090 --> 05:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman I I want to
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank representative McGuire
 
05:07:52.970 --> 05:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire representative
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
Brody Ena everyone for for the effort
 
05:07:58.490 --> 05:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
they have put into this I have been
 
05:08:00.650 --> 05:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
proud of my ability on division one to
 
05:08:02.810 --> 05:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
be able to read the room
 
05:08:06.190 --> 05:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
um in reading the room I feel I will be
 
05:08:08.810 --> 05:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh in the minority or by myself in
 
05:08:11.810 --> 05:08:11.820 align:start position:0%
voting no on this amendment only because
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
I I think I might be one of the few uh
 
05:08:17.150 --> 05:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
supporting the governor's initial
 
05:08:19.010 --> 05:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
proposal from hb2
 
05:08:20.810 --> 05:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
chairman Legion you and I had coffee
 
05:08:22.010 --> 05:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
with him this morning along with other
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
members from Finance he talked about
 
05:08:26.690 --> 05:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
opening up the white board for Licensing
 
05:08:28.970 --> 05:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
in the state allowing the free market to
 
05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
work as the free market does I have no
 
05:08:35.448 --> 05:08:35.458 align:start position:0%
doubt that the Restorations uh the the
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
vetting from Edna for the Restorations
 
05:08:39.590 --> 05:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
that this amendment presents after
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
deleting the governor's proposal uh will
 
05:08:45.650 --> 05:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
do go Great Lengths to reform Licensing
 
05:08:47.930 --> 05:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
in the state and how our state manages
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves and our economy with the free
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
market however as a as a purist and as
 
05:08:54.850 --> 05:08:54.860 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
05:08:57.170 --> 05:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
self-declaring that this is not going to
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
cost my vote on the overall budget but I
 
05:09:02.208 --> 05:09:02.218 align:start position:0%
will just be able to uh
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
advocate for the original submission of
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 while we vote on this amendment and
 
05:09:11.628 --> 05:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
still then support hp2 as a whole uh I
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
want to thank the governor for starting
 
05:09:15.650 --> 05:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
this conversation I know the emails the
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
phone calls it's been a conversation
 
05:09:19.128 --> 05:09:19.138 align:start position:0%
that people have been trying to have in
 
05:09:21.770 --> 05:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
the state for years uh and this process
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
really brought it up to the the fold and
 
05:09:26.330 --> 05:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
brought it up to everyone's attention uh
 
05:09:28.490 --> 05:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
when the guy with the veto prin starts a
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
conversation people start to listen uh
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I want to continue to Champion for
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
future licensing reforms uh originally
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
represent when I thought it was just
 
05:09:41.330 --> 05:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
going to amend the bill to delete all
 
05:09:43.970 --> 05:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
the sections and then vote more back in
 
05:09:46.128 --> 05:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
when it was separate I was going to vote
 
05:09:48.050 --> 05:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
no to delete the sections and then vote
 
05:09:50.690 --> 05:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
Yes to bring some back in but since it's
 
05:09:53.330 --> 05:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
all tied in I'm not voting no because I
 
05:09:54.890 --> 05:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
I don't want these sections in the
 
05:09:57.470 --> 05:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
budget I'm voting no because I'm only
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to get a little bit of the slice
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
of cake that I want in my sense of the
 
05:10:03.650 --> 05:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
room is that that I can take that vote
 
05:10:05.570 --> 05:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
without risking it
 
05:10:07.310 --> 05:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
um but I do I just wanted to say that
 
05:10:09.170 --> 05:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we got through the review
 
05:10:12.170 --> 05:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
without having to debate any individual
 
05:10:13.730 --> 05:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
portion of it because I would have felt
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
as if I was negotiating in bad faith on
 
05:10:18.050 --> 05:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
an amendment that I wouldn't ultimately
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
be supporting so I appreciate the
 
05:10:22.010 --> 05:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
conversation we just had on on each
 
05:10:24.830 --> 05:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
section line by line I just wanted to
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the record and for everybody
 
05:10:28.430 --> 05:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
watching I get I didn't wear my tie
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
today so I guess I can't be pulled by
 
05:10:33.410 --> 05:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
the neck for being so bold anybody that
 
05:10:35.150 --> 05:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
wants to complain to me about licensing
 
05:10:37.128 --> 05:10:37.138 align:start position:0%
feel free to keep emailing and calling
 
05:10:40.610 --> 05:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
me that's fine uh because I intend to
 
05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
stick around for a bit and continue to
 
05:10:45.110 --> 05:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
fight for these reforms but I just want
 
05:10:47.690 --> 05:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
to let that air out thank you very much
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
you're a very valued member of our
 
05:10:51.470 --> 05:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
exhibition as all members are
 
05:10:54.350 --> 05:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
05:10:57.288 --> 05:10:57.298 align:start position:0%
sat here for the last hour
 
05:11:00.010 --> 05:11:00.020 align:start position:0%
on Thursday
 
05:11:03.288 --> 05:11:03.298 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I sat here for the last hour
 
05:11:05.628 --> 05:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm very very impressed
 
05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
with the work that went into this
 
05:11:07.440 --> 05:11:08.810 align:start position:0%
with the work that went into this
document

05:11:08.810 --> 05:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:11:12.730 --> 05:11:12.740 align:start position:0%
and with both representative Maguire's
 
05:11:14.690 --> 05:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
efforts in it
 
05:11:14.700 --> 05:11:16.190 align:start position:0%
efforts in it
uh

05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
I probably too will join representative
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
Sweeney but some of the rain some of the
 
05:11:24.170 --> 05:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
same reasons
 
05:11:27.410 --> 05:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
but my concern is we're doing the work
 
05:11:29.810 --> 05:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
of a policy committee
 
05:11:32.448 --> 05:11:32.458 align:start position:0%
and we are a finance committee
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
and in the last hour of discussion I
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
haven't heard
 
05:11:40.628 --> 05:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
one word that related to class
 
05:11:40.638 --> 05:11:42.288 align:start position:0%
one word that related to class
savings

05:11:42.288 --> 05:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
savings
 
05:11:46.310 --> 05:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
or anything else and I love the document
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
I hope it passes but
 
05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:56.510 --> 05:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
05:11:59.690 --> 05:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
Kimbrell's thank you Mr chair I respect
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin's position but
 
05:12:03.830 --> 05:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
someone has to be the adult in the room
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I think we were the adults so we're
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to push this forward finally and I
 
05:12:11.030 --> 05:12:11.040 align:start position:0%

05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
thanks very much members we have just a
 
05:13:49.128 --> 05:13:49.138 align:start position:0%
very few things left Mr Hoffman Melissa
 
05:13:51.708 --> 05:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
you did hand out our status sheet
 
05:13:53.570 --> 05:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
earlier today and I didn't see too many
 
05:13:56.510 --> 05:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
areas that weren't grayed out but did we
 
05:14:00.128 --> 05:14:00.138 align:start position:0%
also have commissioner arlinghaus is
 
05:14:02.208 --> 05:14:02.218 align:start position:0%
commissioner Goulet are in the hallway
 
05:14:04.788 --> 05:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
okay the follow-up on the Erp
 
05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
conversation yeah okay
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:19.490 --> 05:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:13.128 --> 05:20:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:18.190 --> 05:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
all right we'll uh get going represent
 
05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh we have two representatives from our
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
state government here doit commissioner
 
05:21:32.690 --> 05:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
and the d e d a s d a s Department of
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
administrative Services a the a for the
 
05:21:39.890 --> 05:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
top of the Heap so uh Charlie and
 
05:21:42.590 --> 05:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
I and I believe you're here because
 
05:21:44.330 --> 05:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
there was a concern raised about
 
05:21:48.650 --> 05:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:51.170 --> 05:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
I think we're here at your invitation
 
05:21:51.180 --> 05:21:52.850 align:start position:0%
I think we're here at your invitation
yes

05:21:52.850 --> 05:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:21:54.590 --> 05:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
um we're here because anytime you would
 
05:21:59.110 --> 05:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
like to see us we're happy to come by uh
 
05:22:01.490 --> 05:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'm Charlie arlinghaus I'm the
 
05:22:02.650 --> 05:22:02.660 align:start position:0%
commission of administrative Services
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm Dennis Goulet commissioner for the
 
05:22:07.250 --> 05:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology and
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
if we run into trouble Sherry Rockburn
 
05:22:10.670 --> 05:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
is behind us and at some point she
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
starts waving her arms wildly because of
 
05:22:13.850 --> 05:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
something I said I hope you'll tell me
 
05:22:15.770 --> 05:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
well she's really The A Team you can
 
05:22:19.250 --> 05:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
tell us the truth but yes exactly
 
05:22:22.610 --> 05:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
and so I shared with you my concern that
 
05:22:25.850 --> 05:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
was raised about the new system and the
 
05:22:27.288 --> 05:22:27.298 align:start position:0%
costs and the bidding maybe you could
 
05:22:30.050 --> 05:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
explain that for us I I I'm going to
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
start and uh
 
05:22:35.090 --> 05:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
what I want the committee to know is
 
05:22:35.100 --> 05:22:37.310 align:start position:0%
what I want the committee to know is
that

05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're not doing this half
 
05:22:43.490 --> 05:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
heartedly I almost said I was trying to
 
05:22:44.930 --> 05:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
come up with something
 
05:22:46.250 --> 05:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
um we're not doing this half-heartedly
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
and this is something we've been doing
 
05:22:49.610 --> 05:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
our due diligence on for a long time and
 
05:22:51.948 --> 05:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
have worked very closely with uh with
 
05:22:53.510 --> 05:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and with and with the
 
05:22:54.890 --> 05:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
governor's office to do what we're doing
 
05:22:56.628 --> 05:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's a way state
 
05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
procurements are done and and obviously
 
05:23:01.128 --> 05:23:01.138 align:start position:0%
I would have a concern if the if the
 
05:23:02.690 --> 05:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
only thing you ever put in the state
 
05:23:04.390 --> 05:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
budget in the last decade about
 
05:23:06.530 --> 05:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
procurement and having to go to fiscal
 
05:23:11.150 --> 05:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
was not Medicaid not mmis not HHS
 
05:23:13.788 --> 05:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
contracts not correction contracts not
 
05:23:15.410 --> 05:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
safety contracts not Transportation
 
05:23:17.990 --> 05:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
contracts or labor contracts or banking
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
contracts but merely one procurement
 
05:23:24.288 --> 05:23:24.298 align:start position:0%
that I was doing to single me out as a
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
scoff law and a nerdy will and I hope to
 
05:23:29.570 --> 05:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
convince you that I am not scoffing at
 
05:23:30.890 --> 05:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
the law or
 
05:23:34.610 --> 05:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
that I do well more often than Nair
 
05:23:34.620 --> 05:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
that I do well more often than Nair
um so

05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:23:38.208 --> 05:23:38.218 align:start position:0%
we we have a computer system and we've
 
05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
talked to you about what the Erp is and
 
05:23:41.810 --> 05:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
and how it is and we looked at what we
 
05:23:43.550 --> 05:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
do I've talked to the committee about
 
05:23:45.170 --> 05:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
how we really do have three choices one
 
05:23:46.730 --> 05:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
is to do nothing which
 
05:23:49.610 --> 05:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's not a choice I understand
 
05:23:52.970 --> 05:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
um so to keep you on your leash
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and to uh to reprocure entirely into
 
05:23:57.708 --> 05:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
a whole new system or to upgrade the
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
system that we have and that a lot of
 
05:24:01.970 --> 05:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
the reason that we we chose to upgrade
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
the system we have is is the is the cost
 
05:24:07.368 --> 05:24:07.378 align:start position:0%
and we can do uh reasonable cost
 
05:24:09.530 --> 05:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
estimates without doing an RFP you can
 
05:24:11.208 --> 05:24:11.218 align:start position:0%
figure out what things cost by order of
 
05:24:13.610 --> 05:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
magnitude what we relied on for doing
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
that is not me sort of guesstimating and
 
05:24:19.070 --> 05:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
Googling but the expert advice of people
 
05:24:21.770 --> 05:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
like doit and and we discussed it in
 
05:24:24.350 --> 05:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
intensely with the with the governor and
 
05:24:25.970 --> 05:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
we do believe there's a significant cost
 
05:24:29.390 --> 05:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
there are two pieces right the one is
 
05:24:29.400 --> 05:24:30.010 align:start position:0%
there are two pieces right the one is
um

05:24:30.010 --> 05:24:30.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:32.510 --> 05:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
the risk to the state of overturning the
 
05:24:34.490 --> 05:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
system and going forward it's a risk
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
that if the cost is the same we would we
 
05:24:40.628 --> 05:24:40.638 align:start position:0%
would uh bear but uh the the
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
exponentialness of the price difference
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
is what led us to decide to do an
 
05:24:48.350 --> 05:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
upgrade we happen to know based on
 
05:24:51.530 --> 05:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
technological research that to go from
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
an on-premise info product to the next
 
05:24:56.448 --> 05:24:56.458 align:start position:0%
iteration which is a cloud-based infor
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
product they've done an analysis of a
 
05:25:01.788 --> 05:25:01.798 align:start position:0%
technical analysis which I doubt I can
 
05:25:04.850 --> 05:25:04.860 align:start position:0%
explain but about the fit between the
 
05:25:06.350 --> 05:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
two systems and how much of a change
 
05:25:08.570 --> 05:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
management it is and it's relatively
 
05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
modest in terms of upgrades and so
 
05:25:13.730 --> 05:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
that's one reason we did this but we we
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
believe and I want Dennis to talk about
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
this a little bit if I can we believe
 
05:25:19.250 --> 05:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
that there's an order of magnitude on
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
cost and and the reason we're doing this
 
05:25:24.110 --> 05:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
is because not because we suspect that
 
05:25:25.970 --> 05:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
there's similar costs but because we
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
know there's an enormous difference
 
05:25:30.110 --> 05:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
between the two items
 
05:25:31.730 --> 05:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
so thanks Charlie
 
05:25:35.810 --> 05:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
um so there you might ask well why is
 
05:25:38.090 --> 05:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
there a difference in cost and you know
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
I've I've heard some opinions stated
 
05:25:43.610 --> 05:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
that that doing this action with infor
 
05:25:46.430 --> 05:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
is is equivalent to reprocuring the
 
05:25:49.128 --> 05:25:49.138 align:start position:0%
system which it is not and I'll explain
 
05:25:50.570 --> 05:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
that a little bit in more detail
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
throughout my career I've seen vendors
 
05:25:54.830 --> 05:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
say hey we've got this new this shiny
 
05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
new product product and we want you to
 
05:25:58.250 --> 05:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
move to it
 
05:26:00.350 --> 05:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
and it's going to you know and and since
 
05:26:02.990 --> 05:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's ours it'll be easy but if it's a
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
completely different product then then I
 
05:26:07.490 --> 05:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
would always say oh time to re-procure
 
05:26:08.810 --> 05:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
in other words maybe they went out and
 
05:26:10.128 --> 05:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
acquired it or they developed an
 
05:26:11.570 --> 05:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
in-house and it's new
 
05:26:11.580 --> 05:26:12.708 align:start position:0%
in-house and it's new
so

05:26:12.708 --> 05:26:12.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:26:12.718 --> 05:26:13.368 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:26:13.368 --> 05:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:15.410 --> 05:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
so then that is oh yeah that's
 
05:26:17.208 --> 05:26:17.218 align:start position:0%
re-procurement time because you know
 
05:26:18.830 --> 05:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
that the effort's going to be just as
 
05:26:21.830 --> 05:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
great to use your incumbents so new
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
solution as it would be to implement
 
05:26:26.330 --> 05:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
somebody else's Solution that's not the
 
05:26:29.330 --> 05:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
case here the solution
 
05:26:31.250 --> 05:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
um that infor has in the cloud was
 
05:26:33.288 --> 05:26:33.298 align:start position:0%
evolved directly from the solution we're
 
05:26:36.170 --> 05:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
running today in New Hampshire in our
 
05:26:39.288 --> 05:26:39.298 align:start position:0%
data center over at 27 Hazen so when you
 
05:26:41.330 --> 05:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
look at the structure of the data and
 
05:26:44.810 --> 05:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
and the things that that are in that in
 
05:26:47.510 --> 05:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
that system they're very very similar
 
05:26:50.930 --> 05:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
from the old to news and and the effort
 
05:26:54.670 --> 05:26:54.680 align:start position:0%
to get from old to new is really around
 
05:26:58.730 --> 05:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
looking at how we implemented
 
05:27:01.250 --> 05:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
the system as it runs today and what's
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
the best way to implement it with in
 
05:27:06.050 --> 05:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
terms of the vision going forward within
 
05:27:08.810 --> 05:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
four versus a you know a huge technical
 
05:27:11.390 --> 05:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
effort of transition so it really isn't
 
05:27:15.410 --> 05:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know a a complete new system is an
 
05:27:19.128 --> 05:27:19.138 align:start position:0%
apple moving to the infor cloud Suite is
 
05:27:21.170 --> 05:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
an orange it's just not the same thing
 
05:27:24.590 --> 05:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I think that explains why we feel
 
05:27:27.350 --> 05:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
that there's such a significant Charlie
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
used orders of magnitude that's the term
 
05:27:31.850 --> 05:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
I I like to use as well
 
05:27:33.830 --> 05:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
um it's uh we we feel that there is an
 
05:27:35.410 --> 05:27:35.420 align:start position:0%
orders of magnitude difference
 
05:27:38.208 --> 05:27:38.218 align:start position:0%
additionally there's a logistic there's
 
05:27:40.550 --> 05:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
logistical challenges associated with
 
05:27:43.430 --> 05:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
this that are timing related which I can
 
05:27:46.910 --> 05:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
go into Charlie or or you can go into
 
05:27:46.920 --> 05:27:47.810 align:start position:0%
go into Charlie or or you can go into
um

05:27:47.810 --> 05:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:50.868 --> 05:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
timing is such that
 
05:27:56.810 --> 05:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
we can pretty rapidly move into this
 
05:27:59.330 --> 05:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
Cloud suite and de-risk the situation we
 
05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
have now with respect to end of life for
 
05:28:03.170 --> 05:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
our existing system
 
05:28:04.670 --> 05:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
and it's one of the things we've looked
 
05:28:07.310 --> 05:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
at for multiple systems across the state
 
05:28:08.570 --> 05:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
that have chosen to go with the
 
05:28:10.128 --> 05:28:10.138 align:start position:0%
incumbent recently
 
05:28:13.010 --> 05:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
versus you know a full a full
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
re-implementation time to get from point
 
05:28:18.890 --> 05:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
A to point B
 
05:28:18.900 --> 05:28:19.810 align:start position:0%
A to point B
um

05:28:19.810 --> 05:28:19.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:22.368 --> 05:28:22.378 align:start position:0%
in terms of adding the value that's
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
there so we have the ability to do this
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:28:29.208 --> 05:28:29.218 align:start position:0%
very quickly compared to what it would
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
take to do a full re-procurement and
 
05:28:34.610 --> 05:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
considerably less money so
 
05:28:36.590 --> 05:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if you have any more
 
05:28:38.510 --> 05:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
problems no I think that's I I mean most
 
05:28:39.948 --> 05:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
I won't answer questions the committee
 
05:28:41.270 --> 05:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
has but just to give you a sense of what
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:45.410 --> 05:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
does the committee have questions
 
05:28:47.570 --> 05:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative cameras thank you Mr
 
05:28:50.090 --> 05:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
chair do you feel that your current Erp
 
05:28:53.570 --> 05:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
system is good enough and solid enough
 
05:28:56.030 --> 05:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
to carry you into the future after you
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
do the upgrade of the the and how many
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
years do you think it would take well I
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
I would I mean it'll last as long as any
 
05:29:05.930 --> 05:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
Erp system would you know in the sense
 
05:29:09.350 --> 05:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
of you know I don't think that uh you
 
05:29:11.330 --> 05:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
know oracle will work taking our epic or
 
05:29:13.490 --> 05:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
you know pick something that that sap
 
05:29:15.230 --> 05:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
that that something would last a lot
 
05:29:16.910 --> 05:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
longer than others
 
05:29:16.920 --> 05:29:17.570 align:start position:0%
longer than others
um

05:29:17.570 --> 05:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
do we have to do something yes is the
 
05:29:22.670 --> 05:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
product that we have a pathetic inferior
 
05:29:25.010 --> 05:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
product no it's I mean frankly at the
 
05:29:26.570 --> 05:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
05:29:28.550 --> 05:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
I don't want I'll be accused of slander
 
05:29:30.830 --> 05:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
here but um an Erp system is an Erp
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
system they have advantages and
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
disadvantages and the one we have is
 
05:29:37.190 --> 05:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
fine and it as Dennis said to me once
 
05:29:40.010 --> 05:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
everybody hates their Erp right and it's
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
not because of
 
05:29:43.310 --> 05:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
that it's very Erp it's because
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
everybody hates the computer and having
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
to do things that way but no it's a it's
 
05:29:50.410 --> 05:29:50.420 align:start position:0%
a perfectly reasonable system and if if
 
05:29:52.970 --> 05:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
yeah and that was my point that I was
 
05:29:54.530 --> 05:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
getting at it because of course the big
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
players that are known are Oracle sap
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to make sure that you
 
05:30:00.590 --> 05:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
weren't going with some Rinky Dink Erp
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
company that is on its last legs and and
 
05:30:05.208 --> 05:30:05.218 align:start position:0%
is not going to be able to take you
 
05:30:07.250 --> 05:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
forward into the future you know no I'll
 
05:30:09.590 --> 05:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'll mention that if you if you look and
 
05:30:10.730 --> 05:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
this is something you actually could
 
05:30:12.288 --> 05:30:12.298 align:start position:0%
Google right if you look at you know the
 
05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
top erps you know who would you
 
05:30:17.090 --> 05:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
um I think one of your first Google hits
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
would be who are the top six erps in the
 
05:30:20.750 --> 05:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
country and this is one of them they're
 
05:30:22.550 --> 05:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
very well capitalized it's a company
 
05:30:22.560 --> 05:30:23.930 align:start position:0%
very well capitalized it's a company
that

05:30:23.930 --> 05:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:29.150 --> 05:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
when we bought a system 10 14 ish years
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
ago let's call it 0607 the company we
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
bought at the time was called Lawson
 
05:30:37.550 --> 05:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
and uh infor is a much larger company
 
05:30:39.170 --> 05:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
that has bought I think they probably
 
05:30:40.570 --> 05:30:40.580 align:start position:0%
were called
 
05:30:42.830 --> 05:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
agilysis or something like that at the
 
05:30:44.448 --> 05:30:44.458 align:start position:0%
beginning I don't know what they were
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
called but um they bought a lot of other
 
05:30:48.350 --> 05:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
companies and and so it's one of these
 
05:30:49.970 --> 05:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
it's so it's one of the major players
 
05:30:52.070 --> 05:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's not you know if you said to me if
 
05:30:53.628 --> 05:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
you go to bed who's going to Bid And so
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
they're one of the people who would bet
 
05:30:56.690 --> 05:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
they're they're real
 
05:30:59.090 --> 05:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
the strategy that we're pursuing also
 
05:31:01.310 --> 05:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
solves a fairly large problem for the
 
05:31:03.708 --> 05:31:03.718 align:start position:0%
state particularly for for a part of my
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
department and a big part of Charlie's
 
05:31:08.810 --> 05:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
in that it it'll Shield us largely
 
05:31:11.150 --> 05:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
Shield us from some of the system life
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
cycle stuff that we've been dealing with
 
05:31:14.330 --> 05:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
and we've been spending time and effort
 
05:31:16.368 --> 05:31:16.378 align:start position:0%
now any cloud-based solution would
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
generally do that but we we would get a
 
05:31:21.890 --> 05:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
pretty large benefit from um
 
05:31:25.010 --> 05:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
from moving to Cloud Suite we we would
 
05:31:26.830 --> 05:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
get a similar benefit
 
05:31:31.310 --> 05:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
from any Cloud product with more effort
 
05:31:33.890 --> 05:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
um the the other thing is is that you
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
know over a period of years even the
 
05:31:38.090 --> 05:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
just the eight years I've been here you
 
05:31:40.368 --> 05:31:40.378 align:start position:0%
know seeing that you know it's one thing
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
for a company to say we're going to
 
05:31:42.770 --> 05:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
invest and we're going to make the
 
05:31:44.208 --> 05:31:44.218 align:start position:0%
product better
 
05:31:45.770 --> 05:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's another thing to actually have it
 
05:31:47.930 --> 05:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
happen in front of you which I've
 
05:31:49.788 --> 05:31:49.798 align:start position:0%
observed you know where the they said
 
05:31:51.170 --> 05:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
all right well we're going to do these
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
things to make it but to improve on it
 
05:31:55.910 --> 05:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
and they actually are executing on that
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
you know so as Charlie said there it's
 
05:31:59.150 --> 05:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
hard you know I've been on the other
 
05:32:01.368 --> 05:32:01.378 align:start position:0%
side in the industry when you acquire
 
05:32:03.410 --> 05:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
products to integrate them into your
 
05:32:05.330 --> 05:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
core products that's really difficult to
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
do and and it's something you have to
 
05:32:10.368 --> 05:32:10.378 align:start position:0%
increment over time and infor has been
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
working on that
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
um some of the major players in the
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
market have have had to do the same
 
05:32:16.310 --> 05:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
thing the big players they've been
 
05:32:18.350 --> 05:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
integrating stuff over the years and
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
some of them are well done and some
 
05:32:21.530 --> 05:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
aren't and then there's new players that
 
05:32:23.150 --> 05:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
have started from scratch which don't
 
05:32:26.448 --> 05:32:26.458 align:start position:0%
don't have that challenge per se so so I
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
think that you know that's certainly a
 
05:32:30.650 --> 05:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
point of evidence that
 
05:32:33.050 --> 05:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
um again on the you know we didn't just
 
05:32:35.150 --> 05:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
make this up we thought about it uh
 
05:32:36.890 --> 05:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
point that Charlie made
 
05:32:39.890 --> 05:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee no uh
 
05:32:42.470 --> 05:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
let me ask uh what's the downside of
 
05:32:45.230 --> 05:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
going out to a bid and finding out that
 
05:32:47.410 --> 05:32:47.420 align:start position:0%
this is twice as cheap as something else
 
05:32:49.550 --> 05:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
there there are there are actually two
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
two pieces of that right the the first
 
05:32:55.070 --> 05:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
is time that it it's it's months and it
 
05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
puts us it would probably set us back uh
 
05:33:00.410 --> 05:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
round numbers six months
 
05:33:02.868 --> 05:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
um and uh gets us closer to running out
 
05:33:04.368 --> 05:33:04.378 align:start position:0%
of the arpa money there's a time limit
 
05:33:06.470 --> 05:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
to spending the Europa money and and if
 
05:33:08.208 --> 05:33:08.218 align:start position:0%
I mean if we're honest with ourselves
 
05:33:10.730 --> 05:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
this is New Hampshire we would not be
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
able to upgrade our system the way we
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
typically have budget pressures
 
05:33:19.550 --> 05:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
um except in a year like this one and
 
05:33:21.650 --> 05:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
when there was arpa money available I
 
05:33:23.448 --> 05:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
mean it's just the fact of life
 
05:33:26.750 --> 05:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
um the second piece is that one of the
 
05:33:30.170 --> 05:33:30.180 align:start position:0%
I think we get better pricing by not if
 
05:33:32.810 --> 05:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
if we've decided
 
05:33:35.330 --> 05:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
so procurement broadly writ right you
 
05:33:36.890 --> 05:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
you at some point at the end of a
 
05:33:38.330 --> 05:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
contract you look at it do I want to
 
05:33:39.530 --> 05:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
renew the contract do I want an
 
05:33:41.150 --> 05:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to extend if I have extension
 
05:33:44.628 --> 05:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
years left on my contract and what am I
 
05:33:46.128 --> 05:33:46.138 align:start position:0%
getting out of that because it's a
 
05:33:47.868 --> 05:33:47.878 align:start position:0%
benefit to the company right I'm going
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
to call up you know Fred's garage and
 
05:33:50.400 --> 05:33:51.230 align:start position:0%
to call up you know Fred's garage and
say

05:33:51.230 --> 05:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:33:52.910 --> 05:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
if we don't go out to bid what kind of
 
05:33:54.170 --> 05:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
pricing are you going to get me as
 
05:33:55.850 --> 05:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
opposed to I go out to bed Fred's going
 
05:33:56.990 --> 05:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
to give me a better price because he
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go out to bed and and I
 
05:34:01.010 --> 05:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
05:34:03.050 --> 05:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
I think if we did an RFP we would end up
 
05:34:06.050 --> 05:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
within four again because the change
 
05:34:08.448 --> 05:34:08.458 align:start position:0%
management is so dramatically less
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
because of because the product we're
 
05:34:13.610 --> 05:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
moving from is in for two in four when
 
05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
one imagines that it's going to be a
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
little easier for them but at a
 
05:34:19.550 --> 05:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
different price there's a I mean I think
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
05:34:24.230 --> 05:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
um a price break because we're not uh
 
05:34:26.030 --> 05:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
doing that and and we certainly expect
 
05:34:29.930 --> 05:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.970 --> 05:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so are there are you gonna
 
05:34:33.708 --> 05:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
because this is cloud-based are you
 
05:34:34.970 --> 05:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
gonna have to upgrade your internet
 
05:34:37.850 --> 05:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
services and pay more to Comcast or
 
05:34:39.890 --> 05:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
whoever because of that
 
05:34:42.110 --> 05:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
we we did that
 
05:34:42.120 --> 05:34:43.150 align:start position:0%
we we did that
um

05:34:43.150 --> 05:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
before the great DS diaspora uh kova
 
05:34:50.208 --> 05:34:50.218 align:start position:0%
diaspora so we're sitting pretty on
 
05:34:50.218 --> 05:34:51.470 align:start position:0%
diaspora so we're sitting pretty on
internet

05:34:51.470 --> 05:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
internet
 
05:34:53.990 --> 05:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
um oh what what does change though is
 
05:34:56.090 --> 05:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes and we may want to consider
 
05:34:56.100 --> 05:34:57.410 align:start position:0%
sometimes and we may want to consider
that

05:34:57.410 --> 05:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:34:59.628 --> 05:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
um for some of our applications I'll
 
05:35:02.090 --> 05:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
I'll just use um CAD RMS for Department
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
of Safety A computer-aid dispatch
 
05:35:06.590 --> 05:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
records management system we provisioned
 
05:35:09.948 --> 05:35:09.958 align:start position:0%
a circuit to Amazon web services for
 
05:35:11.868 --> 05:35:11.878 align:start position:0%
safety so that they wouldn't be
 
05:35:13.670 --> 05:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
contending with other traffic so it
 
05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't so much of a total bandwidth
 
05:35:17.208 --> 05:35:17.218 align:start position:0%
thing it was a purity of of mission
 
05:35:19.190 --> 05:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
thing on the network so we would
 
05:35:20.930 --> 05:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
consider that we we will probably do
 
05:35:22.490 --> 05:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
something like that with liquor as well
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
when at the appropriate time for their
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
cloud-based system as well
 
05:35:31.430 --> 05:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
is our Microsoft product is currently
 
05:35:35.090 --> 05:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh uh internet based as opposed to on my
 
05:35:37.430 --> 05:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
computer well the the Microsoft products
 
05:35:39.650 --> 05:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
that we're all running now in all
 
05:35:41.690 --> 05:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
branches and constitutional offices is
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
Microsoft 365 which is sitting in some
 
05:35:48.110 --> 05:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
data center somewhere in Virginia and we
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
don't think much about it and we did not
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
provision extra bandwidth for that
 
05:35:53.690 --> 05:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
although what we did find was that in
 
05:35:55.550 --> 05:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
some agencies or some locations where
 
05:35:57.050 --> 05:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
they had a you know they had a really
 
05:35:57.060 --> 05:35:58.010 align:start position:0%
they had a you know they had a really
small

05:35:58.010 --> 05:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:36:00.650 --> 05:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
a connection back to the Mothership the
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
mothership being 27 Hayes and we did
 
05:36:04.490 --> 05:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
tweak that a little bit to help them
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
with their performance and Charlie might
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
have been in that category or maybe in
 
05:36:11.628 --> 05:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
that category but I'm not sure so for
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
example when we're we're doing
 
05:36:15.410 --> 05:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
renovations on the annex right now or
 
05:36:19.730 --> 05:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
about two and it includes wires and a
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
bunch of other stuff that are technical
 
05:36:25.430 --> 05:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and I am told reliably that our wires
 
05:36:28.730 --> 05:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
will improve and that I will see
 
05:36:31.250 --> 05:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
um faster results when I'm using Excel
 
05:36:34.190 --> 05:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
as well whenever we do work in a
 
05:36:36.110 --> 05:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
building we pull stuff out of the wall
 
05:36:39.770 --> 05:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
and try to replace it with a wider thing
 
05:36:41.868 --> 05:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
that's not technically accurate well
 
05:36:43.610 --> 05:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
another another project that's ongoing
 
05:36:46.128 --> 05:36:46.138 align:start position:0%
is we are replacing almost the entire
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
executive branch Network
 
05:36:52.368 --> 05:36:52.378 align:start position:0%
which was funded with
 
05:36:55.250 --> 05:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
with arpa money's a while back and we're
 
05:36:57.410 --> 05:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
well into the implementation of that in
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
fact all of liquor is done that wasn't
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
funded with arpa liquor funded on liquor
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
operations but but the same I it's the
 
05:37:04.490 --> 05:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
basically the same project with
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
different funding sources so that's
 
05:37:08.690 --> 05:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing Charlie's we're trying to
 
05:37:10.368 --> 05:37:10.378 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the renovations and
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
putting the new gear and why I think
 
05:37:14.650 --> 05:37:14.660 align:start position:0%
there's some wires too I'm not sure but
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
something but but it uh but your
 
05:37:21.470 --> 05:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
question sir is is the good one in that
 
05:37:23.690 --> 05:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
it the going to the cloud does change
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
how you think about your networking and
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
the importance of your network internet
 
05:37:30.230 --> 05:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
pipes and
 
05:37:32.448 --> 05:37:32.458 align:start position:0%
um in this budget we've seen a lot of
 
05:37:35.868 --> 05:37:35.878 align:start position:0%
spending for it and not just this one
 
05:37:37.628 --> 05:37:37.638 align:start position:0%
but liquor
 
05:37:40.190 --> 05:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
agriculture I think we just approved
 
05:37:42.170 --> 05:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
something for Human Rights Commission or
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
something are we trying to ask you for
 
05:37:47.030 --> 05:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
too much here trying to too many
 
05:37:49.070 --> 05:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
upgrades all at once or are we going to
 
05:37:51.410 --> 05:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
be comfortable
 
05:37:55.190 --> 05:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
um well we're we're doing a lot
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
um a lot more than we ever had and I and
 
05:38:00.948 --> 05:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
if you'd have asked my staff if you know
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
four years ago if this was possible um I
 
05:38:06.590 --> 05:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
think they would have said no uh one of
 
05:38:07.970 --> 05:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
the things that changed all around the
 
05:38:09.650 --> 05:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
country in state governments during
 
05:38:13.010 --> 05:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
covid was we we moved a lot faster and
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
we thought it was just going to be a
 
05:38:16.670 --> 05:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
temporary thing but it isn't it's
 
05:38:18.890 --> 05:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
changed the pace of how we operate and
 
05:38:21.530 --> 05:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
and my expectations of
 
05:38:26.448 --> 05:38:26.458 align:start position:0%
pace have have adjusted and and so so my
 
05:38:28.368 --> 05:38:28.378 align:start position:0%
expectation is that we will
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
um we need to fund things properly in
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
other words if we don't have enough
 
05:38:34.010 --> 05:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
staff State staff to get something done
 
05:38:35.990 --> 05:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
during the good times then we got to
 
05:38:37.490 --> 05:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
make sure that we augment it a little
 
05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
bit to make sure that it happens which
 
05:38:41.150 --> 05:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
is a part of what Charlie's team has
 
05:38:45.050 --> 05:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
considered in his proposal and uh so I'm
 
05:38:47.330 --> 05:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable like that the human
 
05:38:48.830 --> 05:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
rights is a great one they've been
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
struggling for years trying to get
 
05:38:52.010 --> 05:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
something to happen can we make that
 
05:38:52.020 --> 05:38:52.850 align:start position:0%
something to happen can we make that
happen

05:38:52.850 --> 05:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:38:52.860 --> 05:38:54.288 align:start position:0%
happen
yes

05:38:54.288 --> 05:38:54.298 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:38:58.190 --> 05:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
so um I just ask you uh if you find
 
05:39:00.590 --> 05:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
yourself having to prioritize I think
 
05:39:02.208 --> 05:39:02.218 align:start position:0%
this committee would appreciate it if
 
05:39:05.448 --> 05:39:05.458 align:start position:0%
you do dra and liquor first and let the
 
05:39:05.458 --> 05:39:06.610 align:start position:0%
you do dra and liquor first and let the
others

05:39:06.610 --> 05:39:06.620 align:start position:0%
others
 
05:39:09.470 --> 05:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
under revenue is King
 
05:39:09.480 --> 05:39:12.350 align:start position:0%
under revenue is King
foreign

05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:14.330 --> 05:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other questions
 
05:39:17.930 --> 05:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
on this topic okay we have an item so I
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
think we already approved this item but
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to revisit it no okay
 
05:39:23.040 --> 05:39:24.288 align:start position:0%
does anybody want to revisit it no okay
good

05:39:24.288 --> 05:39:24.298 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:39:27.410 --> 05:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
um uh from the hospital to Granite Place
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
purchase is still white here so Charlie
 
05:39:34.128 --> 05:39:34.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:36.170 --> 05:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
pending here
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
um I think on this one we were choosing
 
05:39:38.930 --> 05:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
that to vote until we found out if we
 
05:39:40.910 --> 05:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
could use arpa funds I was able to get
 
05:39:42.530 --> 05:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
in touch with the governor's budget
 
05:39:44.990 --> 05:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
director this morning and he said
 
05:39:46.910 --> 05:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
um arpa funds are very limited at this
 
05:39:48.410 --> 05:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
point and they wouldn't be able to be
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
allocated for this project all right so
 
05:39:52.970 --> 05:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
presumably we still need granite place
 
05:39:55.970 --> 05:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:58.430 --> 05:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
if you want a garage
 
05:40:00.250 --> 05:40:00.260 align:start position:0%
I don't but anyway
 
05:40:03.470 --> 05:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
yes it represents thank you so I do see
 
05:40:05.690 --> 05:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
here uh it says 21 million in fiscal
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
year 23 so that's surplus funds
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
currently so
 
05:40:12.470 --> 05:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
do we have an updated Surplus fund
 
05:40:15.410 --> 05:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
statement that we're not overspending
 
05:40:22.128 --> 05:40:22.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:22.138 --> 05:40:27.128 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:40:27.128 --> 05:40:27.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:29.810 --> 05:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
ER of course
 
05:40:31.730 --> 05:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
I can just point out something on this
 
05:40:33.650 --> 05:40:33.660 align:start position:0%
document that may be helpful um I just
 
05:40:34.910 --> 05:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
want to point out two things on the
 
05:40:39.230 --> 05:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
document one we just worked with HB 571
 
05:40:41.410 --> 05:40:41.420 align:start position:0%
so you know that's built in here as a
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
84.2 million dollar hit which I think
 
05:40:45.770 --> 05:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you said would be
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
an estimated 10 million
 
05:40:49.788 --> 05:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
so we'll gain back
 
05:40:52.310 --> 05:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
um about 70 million 74 million on that
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
so then that negative balance at the
 
05:40:56.690 --> 05:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page will then flip to
 
05:40:59.390 --> 05:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
positive and granite place because it
 
05:41:00.830 --> 05:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
was in the governor's budget is already
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
factored into this so you don't have to
 
05:41:06.050 --> 05:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
take a hit on that it's only if you
 
05:41:08.810 --> 05:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
reduce it will you add back money
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
all right so do we need a show of hands
 
05:41:14.690 --> 05:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
that will accept items number 75 and 76
 
05:41:17.690 --> 05:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2. unanimous all right
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
very good
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
what's next and I'd be excused or yes
 
05:41:24.590 --> 05:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming unless you know of
 
05:41:28.010 --> 05:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
any other Das matters that are
 
05:41:28.020 --> 05:41:31.250 align:start position:0%
any other Das matters that are
pendings

05:41:31.250 --> 05:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:31.260 --> 05:41:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:41:33.350 --> 05:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:41:37.788 --> 05:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
all right so the next one I see is uh
 
05:41:41.830 --> 05:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:45.110 --> 05:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
and yes historic sites I think we did
 
05:41:46.670 --> 05:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
this one yeah the other day there was a
 
05:41:50.810 --> 05:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
house built two section that funded that
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and in our work we found there's a an
 
05:41:56.570 --> 05:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
account in house bill one that we can
 
05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
just flip the funding on it's more
 
05:42:00.650 --> 05:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be changed in house bill
 
05:42:03.470 --> 05:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
one we discussed it with the agency and
 
05:42:04.970 --> 05:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
they're fine
 
05:42:07.128 --> 05:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
so we would
 
05:42:09.650 --> 05:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
eliminate that section instead of
 
05:42:11.330 --> 05:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
approve it
 
05:42:14.330 --> 05:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
I see all right so we'll still spend the
 
05:42:15.530 --> 05:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
same amount of money but it'll be in
 
05:42:17.690 --> 05:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
house bill one as opposed to House Bill
 
05:42:20.208 --> 05:42:20.218 align:start position:0%
two that's correct everyone all right
 
05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
without raise your hands yeah okay good
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
so we'll do that
 
05:42:31.208 --> 05:42:31.218 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing we just did that
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
but it's a plus let me put a star on
 
05:42:34.680 --> 05:42:36.070 align:start position:0%
but it's a plus let me put a star on
there

05:42:36.070 --> 05:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:42:38.190 --> 05:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
you want to reconsider
 
05:42:38.200 --> 05:42:43.910 align:start position:0%
you want to reconsider
[Laughter]

05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:47.750 --> 05:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so now we have new food waste add
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
Contents I thought we already did that
 
05:42:49.440 --> 05:42:51.708 align:start position:0%
Contents I thought we already did that
yeah

05:42:51.708 --> 05:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:51.718 --> 05:42:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:42:54.050 --> 05:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:56.628 --> 05:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
these amendments in White have been
 
05:42:56.638 --> 05:42:57.770 align:start position:0%
these amendments in White have been
discussed

05:42:57.770 --> 05:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
05:43:01.010 --> 05:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
but not formally approved
 
05:43:02.628 --> 05:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
all right so representative evil would
 
05:43:11.810 --> 05:43:11.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:11.820 --> 05:43:38.330 align:start position:0%
 
.

05:43:38.330 --> 05:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.190 --> 05:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.670 --> 05:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.680 --> 05:43:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:43:48.240 --> 05:43:58.368 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

05:43:58.368 --> 05:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:00.830 --> 05:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
right so representative McGuire you want
 
05:44:03.048 --> 05:44:03.058 align:start position:0%
to continue they didn't get any
 
05:44:04.910 --> 05:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
complaints when I came back so I think
 
05:44:06.830 --> 05:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be doing a good job okay so
 
05:44:09.788 --> 05:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
representative evil Elizabeth
 
05:44:12.530 --> 05:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
so we were just going through the things
 
05:44:15.048 --> 05:44:15.058 align:start position:0%
that hadn't been shaded out and we had
 
05:44:16.670 --> 05:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
just a few more
 
05:44:21.410 --> 05:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
things to do so um we have to uh just
 
05:44:23.570 --> 05:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
approve a bunch of amendments that we've
 
05:44:26.570 --> 05:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
been talking about so the first one here
 
05:44:32.288 --> 05:44:32.298 align:start position:0%
is 10 I I move passage of uh Amendment
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
1070 H which is the embodiment of the um
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:49.970 --> 05:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
discussion in discussion no all right
 
05:44:52.368 --> 05:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
let's call the request problem
 
05:44:53.830 --> 05:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:05.628 --> 05:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
so much I'm still stuck on oplc here
 
05:45:05.638 --> 05:45:08.750 align:start position:0%
so much I'm still stuck on oplc here
okay

05:45:08.750 --> 05:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:14.448 --> 05:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
all right 10 70 H all right
 
05:45:14.458 --> 05:45:16.250 align:start position:0%
all right 10 70 H all right
um

05:45:16.250 --> 05:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:21.530 --> 05:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
evil moved and Maguire seconded I think
 
05:45:23.570 --> 05:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
all right representative Maguire yes
 
05:45:25.448 --> 05:45:25.458 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yes
 
05:45:27.288 --> 05:45:27.298 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney yes
 
05:45:29.350 --> 05:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative cambrells yes
 
05:45:32.990 --> 05:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative grassy yes
 
05:45:37.010 --> 05:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
Hewitt here okay evil votes yes
 
05:45:40.850 --> 05:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
representative leishman yes okay
 
05:45:44.628 --> 05:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six zero the
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
amendment passes
 
05:45:49.788 --> 05:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
or seven I don't count very well that's
 
05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
why you're on finance oh you know I
 
05:45:56.110 --> 05:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
didn't I I was so busy riding in grassy
 
05:45:58.788 --> 05:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
that I I okay
 
05:46:02.330 --> 05:46:02.340 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the first one so um Mr
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hoffman there's a double question mark
 
05:46:05.040 --> 05:46:06.110 align:start position:0%
Hoffman there's a double question mark
um

05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:08.208 --> 05:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
moving a position is there any reason
 
05:46:09.770 --> 05:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
for that yes that was the house bill 2
 
05:46:11.810 --> 05:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
Section requested by Environmental
 
05:46:14.570 --> 05:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
Services to transfer a position and
 
05:46:16.670 --> 05:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
that's another one that as we work
 
05:46:18.650 --> 05:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
through it we realize we can do that in
 
05:46:20.090 --> 05:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
house bill one we don't need a house
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
bill 2 section
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay so shall we do that so we have an
 
05:46:26.810 --> 05:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
amendment so you're just going to add a
 
05:46:29.208 --> 05:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
position to House Bill we would make the
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
swap in house bill one and then delete
 
05:46:33.048 --> 05:46:33.058 align:start position:0%
this section and that's where that
 
05:46:34.970 --> 05:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
amendment number would do is delete this
 
05:46:36.288 --> 05:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
section okay
 
05:46:38.810 --> 05:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
all right so do we need to see it or are
 
05:46:42.530 --> 05:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
we happy yeah all in favor yeah all
 
05:46:46.250 --> 05:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
right go done for that one
 
05:46:48.530 --> 05:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
um representative leishman new section
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
relative to Liquor Commission
 
05:46:56.090 --> 05:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
and so thank you Mr Hoffman okay
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr Hawk and for finding this
 
05:46:58.320 --> 05:47:00.170 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr Hawk and for finding this
language

05:47:00.170 --> 05:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:47:02.628 --> 05:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
this is something that representative
 
05:47:05.510 --> 05:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
Ober when she was chair of division one
 
05:47:09.948 --> 05:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:09.958 --> 05:47:11.570 align:start position:0%
 
Karen

05:47:11.570 --> 05:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
Karen
 
05:47:16.070 --> 05:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh bum burger from North Conway
 
05:47:18.410 --> 05:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
we have discussed this in the past quite
 
05:47:20.208 --> 05:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
05:47:21.890 --> 05:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
on the fistel committee The Liquor
 
05:47:24.170 --> 05:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
Commission will come in to tell us they
 
05:47:26.570 --> 05:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
have closed a liquor store and there's
 
05:47:30.310 --> 05:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
no notice and it's been somewhat uh
 
05:47:32.448 --> 05:47:32.458 align:start position:0%
problematic to some of us that the
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
public isn't forewarned of a closure
 
05:47:38.810 --> 05:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
so as you can see in this language it
 
05:47:42.650 --> 05:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
would require at least input by the
 
05:47:44.510 --> 05:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and the governor and
 
05:47:44.520 --> 05:47:46.070 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and the governor and
Council

05:47:46.070 --> 05:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
Council
 
05:47:48.830 --> 05:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
before a closure happens
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
oh this was in the budget two years ago
 
05:47:55.850 --> 05:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:58.670 --> 05:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire so
 
05:48:01.128 --> 05:48:01.138 align:start position:0%
um I guess to be fair isn't this wasn't
 
05:48:03.048 --> 05:48:03.058 align:start position:0%
this a bill that the Commerce Committee
 
05:48:05.628 --> 05:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
didn't care for this year or well
 
05:48:09.048 --> 05:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
they've never cared for it but I seem to
 
05:48:10.970 --> 05:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
recall testifying in the Commerce yeah
 
05:48:14.150 --> 05:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
and this actually adds the governing
 
05:48:15.530 --> 05:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
Council so it's a little different
 
05:48:17.448 --> 05:48:17.458 align:start position:0%
before it was just the fiscal committee
 
05:48:19.490 --> 05:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
that went to Commerce but this adds a
 
05:48:21.830 --> 05:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
government Council and the fiscal
 
05:48:21.840 --> 05:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
government Council and the fiscal
committee

05:48:23.750 --> 05:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:48:23.760 --> 05:48:26.090 align:start position:0%
committee
that's

05:48:26.090 --> 05:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:48:27.890 --> 05:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
thanks okay
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.708 --> 05:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.718 --> 05:48:41.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:48:41.810 --> 05:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:48:46.610 --> 05:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:48.650 --> 05:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm Sweeney yes
 
05:48:51.830 --> 05:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
cameras yes
 
05:48:53.948 --> 05:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
grassy yes
 
05:49:10.448 --> 05:49:10.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:35.280 --> 05:49:45.170 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

05:49:45.170 --> 05:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:47.448 --> 05:49:47.458 align:start position:0%
I really think representative Abel's
 
05:49:49.610 --> 05:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
name should be on here Mr Hawk and I
 
05:49:50.868 --> 05:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
know it's always supposed to be the
 
05:49:53.030 --> 05:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
chair but the efforts that
 
05:49:54.890 --> 05:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
have gone on it should probably be
 
05:49:57.070 --> 05:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ebola
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:05.810 --> 05:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
um all right uh so I'd like to move
 
05:50:07.510 --> 05:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
um Amendment
 
05:50:12.410 --> 05:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
1063h relative to HB 212. it's been
 
05:50:14.448 --> 05:50:14.458 align:start position:0%
moved is it second it represents Sweeney
 
05:50:16.730 --> 05:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
05:50:19.970 --> 05:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
um so this basically just
 
05:50:22.610 --> 05:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
um does what I explained in finance
 
05:50:25.970 --> 05:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday we decided uh not to
 
05:50:29.810 --> 05:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate new funds for the pfas fund
 
05:50:34.128 --> 05:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
but to expand the capability of the
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
existing fund to use
 
05:50:40.368 --> 05:50:40.378 align:start position:0%
a limited number of funds for
 
05:50:43.128 --> 05:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
investigating testing and monitoring for
 
05:50:49.010 --> 05:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
pfas and the new language is on page 2
 
05:50:54.470 --> 05:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
line 34 and 35. so it allows them to use
 
05:50:58.548 --> 05:50:58.558 align:start position:0%
up to 10 of the original appropriation I
 
05:51:02.330 --> 05:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
think which is 25 million to do some
 
05:51:04.310 --> 05:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
really really important work that they
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
need to continue doing
 
05:51:09.470 --> 05:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
questions for representative evil
 
05:51:12.650 --> 05:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:15.770 --> 05:51:15.780 align:start position:0%

foreign

05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.708 --> 05:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
Aid on page 12.
 
05:54:35.390 --> 05:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:45.650 --> 05:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:48.230 --> 05:54:48.240 align:start position:0%

this

05:54:49.548 --> 05:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:54:52.250 --> 05:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
the amendment 1140 I guess it does have
 
05:54:55.010 --> 05:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
a new number everybody okay with the
 
05:55:03.470 --> 05:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:04.970 --> 05:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
form representative evil would like to
 
05:55:06.708 --> 05:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
formalize well the
 
05:55:08.690 --> 05:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
the clerk feels like it would probably
 
05:55:11.230 --> 05:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
be appropriate I'll move
 
05:55:11.240 --> 05:55:12.970 align:start position:0%
be appropriate I'll move
amendment

05:55:12.970 --> 05:55:12.980 align:start position:0%

05:55:18.410 --> 05:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Griffin
 
05:55:18.420 --> 05:55:20.288 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Griffin
okay

05:55:20.288 --> 05:55:20.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:55:25.368 --> 05:55:25.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:28.070 --> 05:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
all right I will I guess representative
 
05:55:30.288 --> 05:55:30.298 align:start position:0%
hewittism here but that's all right okay
 
05:55:30.298 --> 05:55:33.770 align:start position:0%
hewittism here but that's all right okay
representative

05:55:33.770 --> 05:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.030 --> 05:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's not yes okay representative Griffin
 
05:55:42.288 --> 05:55:42.298 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sweeney yes yes
 
05:55:45.910 --> 05:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative grassy reluctantly yes
 
05:55:49.548 --> 05:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
uh representative the clerk
 
05:55:52.430 --> 05:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
clerk both know representative leishman
 
05:55:56.208 --> 05:55:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:59.330 --> 05:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
okay so six to one the motion passes I
 
05:56:01.070 --> 05:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
just think it's cleaner to do it that
 
05:56:01.080 --> 05:56:04.128 align:start position:0%
just think it's cleaner to do it that
way

05:56:04.128 --> 05:56:04.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:06.650 --> 05:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
all right representative McGuire we've
 
05:56:09.110 --> 05:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
already done this
 
05:56:11.868 --> 05:56:11.878 align:start position:0%
um or have we not I think we approved
 
05:56:13.910 --> 05:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 50 but we haven't actually
 
05:56:16.610 --> 05:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
okay so everybody okay moving it into
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
the budget Melissa says no
 
05:56:24.770 --> 05:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
sorry if I could just jump in again so
 
05:56:27.830 --> 05:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
hb50 has been already passed by full
 
05:56:29.810 --> 05:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
finance and I believe is going to be
 
05:56:31.390 --> 05:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
heard on the floor
 
05:56:34.190 --> 05:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
so I believe you wanted this
 
05:56:38.810 --> 05:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
amended well can we now can we do things
 
05:56:40.368 --> 05:56:40.378 align:start position:0%
slightly in reverse order in the sense
 
05:56:44.090 --> 05:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
that I expect it to be tabled so
 
05:56:46.368 --> 05:56:46.378 align:start position:0%
um after the passive and table that's my
 
05:56:46.378 --> 05:56:47.628 align:start position:0%
um after the passive and table that's my
plan

05:56:47.628 --> 05:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
plan
 
05:56:50.690 --> 05:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
um can we for now accept this amendment
 
05:56:54.110 --> 05:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
and that way when I say you know if I
 
05:56:55.730 --> 05:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
know why I should table this that it's
 
05:56:57.410 --> 05:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
already in the budget
 
05:57:00.110 --> 05:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
go that way yeah
 
05:57:02.270 --> 05:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you're fine because the
 
05:57:05.750 --> 05:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
full finance committee vote is the
 
05:57:08.448 --> 05:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
committee's report
 
05:57:12.770 --> 05:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
so that will happen sometime next week
 
05:57:14.448 --> 05:57:14.458 align:start position:0%
and you'll have
 
05:57:14.458 --> 05:57:16.430 align:start position:0%
and you'll have
um Friday

05:57:16.430 --> 05:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
um Friday
 
05:57:20.270 --> 05:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
if you need to make a change okay I
 
05:57:21.948 --> 05:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
believe the plan is to for all the
 
05:57:25.010 --> 05:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
divisions to recess until Friday morning
 
05:57:27.770 --> 05:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
timing wise it works so you'd rather we
 
05:57:30.170 --> 05:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
do don't take this vote now
 
05:57:32.930 --> 05:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's up to you either way
 
05:57:35.930 --> 05:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
okay I just have a question Mr Hoffman I
 
05:57:37.730 --> 05:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
should know the answer but
 
05:57:41.650 --> 05:57:41.660 align:start position:0%
if we table something
 
05:57:45.288 --> 05:57:45.298 align:start position:0%
at this late stage doesn't it take a
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
super majority to get it off the table
 
05:57:49.440 --> 05:57:51.530 align:start position:0%
super majority to get it off the table
yeah

05:57:51.530 --> 05:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:57:51.540 --> 05:57:53.270 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:57:57.048 --> 05:57:57.058 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm just yeah yeah or get a
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
super majority I'm just concerned if we
 
05:58:00.530 --> 05:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
put it on the table or we ever get it
 
05:58:02.510 --> 05:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
off if it's
 
05:58:04.128 --> 05:58:04.138 align:start position:0%
but he's just
 
05:58:05.990 --> 05:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
he was just going to roll it into age
 
05:58:09.170 --> 05:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
yeah what I'm going to say is
 
05:58:09.180 --> 05:58:09.948 align:start position:0%
yeah what I'm going to say is
um

05:58:09.948 --> 05:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:12.470 --> 05:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know now that we've passed it
 
05:58:15.470 --> 05:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
I want to put it on the table and we
 
05:58:18.048 --> 05:58:18.058 align:start position:0%
will put it into house bill to
 
05:58:21.530 --> 05:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
to give it more chance of being passed
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the long run right because if we just
 
05:58:26.270 --> 05:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
send it as a bill to the Senate right
 
05:58:28.788 --> 05:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
they can say no right it doesn't affect
 
05:58:31.548 --> 05:58:31.558 align:start position:0%
the budget we have no more no more shot
 
05:58:33.590 --> 05:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
at it sort of all right but if we put it
 
05:58:36.590 --> 05:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 they say no now we can
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
argue right now we can it's something
 
05:58:42.770 --> 05:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
that's yes it's kind of a unique way of
 
05:58:44.570 --> 05:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
doing it but I'm not surprised you have
 
05:58:47.850 --> 05:58:47.860 align:start position:0%
some UniQue Ideas so we're good
 
05:58:47.860 --> 05:58:52.970 align:start position:0%
some UniQue Ideas so we're good
[Laughter]

05:58:52.970 --> 05:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:58:55.330 --> 05:58:55.340 align:start position:0%
working out
 
05:58:59.330 --> 05:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:06.708 --> 05:59:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:08.810 --> 05:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
when the uh
 
05:59:12.230 --> 05:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
Treasurer asked to have the debt service
 
05:59:15.470 --> 05:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
line move from treasury to revenue yeah
 
05:59:19.310 --> 05:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
that supports that project they uh
 
05:59:21.530 --> 05:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
they initially disagreed and then they
 
05:59:23.990 --> 05:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
met and came up with a compromise that
 
05:59:26.510 --> 05:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
would include this uh change we looked
 
05:59:42.590 --> 05:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:42.600 --> 05:59:44.628 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:59:44.628 --> 05:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:59:44.638 --> 06:00:04.850 align:start position:0%
[Music]
thanks

06:00:04.850 --> 06:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:07.368 --> 06:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
06:00:13.548 --> 06:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:16.128 --> 06:00:16.138 align:start position:0%
anyone have any issues with this you
 
06:00:18.530 --> 06:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
know we did hear from the commissioner
 
06:00:22.190 --> 06:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:24.350 --> 06:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
I guess we'd hoped that they could
 
06:00:26.390 --> 06:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
afford it without going to the
 
06:00:29.330 --> 06:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
Governor but
 
06:00:31.730 --> 06:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
all right seeing any show just to show
 
06:00:33.470 --> 06:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
our hands is that all right everybody
 
06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
06:00:39.948 --> 06:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hoffman
 
06:00:42.830 --> 06:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
right where's that other little sheet
 
06:00:47.208 --> 06:00:47.218 align:start position:0%
that I saw earlier on my pile yes we do
 
06:00:49.310 --> 06:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:00:52.910 --> 06:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
list of outstanding items from
 
06:01:06.410 --> 06:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:06.420 --> 06:01:12.048 align:start position:0%
 
321.

06:01:12.048 --> 06:01:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:19.310 --> 06:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:23.868 --> 06:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
so information technology department
 
06:01:27.288 --> 06:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
funding of additional requests
 
06:01:30.830 --> 06:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
yep you've uh you've reviewed the budget
 
06:01:33.708 --> 06:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
have you reviewed their requests and
 
06:01:36.590 --> 06:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
approved some of them or actually most
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
of them in this case the only thing is a
 
06:01:41.810 --> 06:01:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh acceptance of the budget as a whole
 
06:01:44.208 --> 06:01:44.218 align:start position:0%
okay did we ever hear back there was
 
06:01:47.390 --> 06:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
safety and Fish and Game yes did we ever
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
hear back
 
06:01:51.110 --> 06:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
I checked with the other divisions and
 
06:01:53.930 --> 06:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
those agencies that are paying for those
 
06:01:57.110 --> 06:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
did not make the request oh they didn't
 
06:02:00.170 --> 06:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
okay so since the since the agency
 
06:02:00.180 --> 06:02:01.368 align:start position:0%
okay so since the since the agency
paying

06:02:01.368 --> 06:02:01.378 align:start position:0%
paying
 
06:02:03.470 --> 06:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
didn't ask for it I don't see any need
 
06:02:05.090 --> 06:02:05.100 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
06:02:07.010 --> 06:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
add it here
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
all right so uh
 
06:02:11.628 --> 06:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
again this is just uh the budget amounts
 
06:02:14.628 --> 06:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
as far as the priorities that we put
 
06:02:16.910 --> 06:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
back do we have a number
 
06:02:19.490 --> 06:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman I
 
06:02:21.410 --> 06:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a final number we have
 
06:02:24.048 --> 06:02:24.058 align:start position:0%
a lot of work to do with okay with the
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
interagency transfers and making sure we
 
06:02:28.610 --> 06:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
get the data entry correct
 
06:02:30.830 --> 06:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
all right we all we'll get those numbers
 
06:02:33.170 --> 06:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with obviously if we
 
06:02:35.868 --> 06:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
approve their priority requests we have
 
06:02:37.610 --> 06:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
to fund them
 
06:02:39.770 --> 06:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
and we did look at the numbers I believe
 
06:02:39.780 --> 06:02:41.208 align:start position:0%
and we did look at the numbers I believe
so

06:02:41.208 --> 06:02:41.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:02:43.610 --> 06:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
child advocate we did put a few things
 
06:02:44.990 --> 06:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
there where
 
06:02:47.090 --> 06:02:47.100 align:start position:0%
Melissa I just grabbed representative
 
06:02:49.430 --> 06:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
Weiler so he could propose a couple
 
06:02:51.470 --> 06:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
amendments I'm it's the little window by
 
06:02:53.930 --> 06:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
grabbing him oh good for hb2 so I didn't
 
06:02:57.110 --> 06:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
know yeah that's perfect well he's here
 
06:02:59.208 --> 06:02:59.218 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler has some really
 
06:03:03.530 --> 06:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:06.410 --> 06:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
Banks represent Weiland
 
06:03:08.030 --> 06:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
I would consider them more as
 
06:03:08.040 --> 06:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
I would consider them more as
housekeeping

06:03:08.880 --> 06:03:08.890 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
 
06:03:08.890 --> 06:03:13.128 align:start position:0%
housekeeping
[Laughter]

06:03:13.128 --> 06:03:13.138 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:03:15.288 --> 06:03:15.298 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that that irritated
 
06:03:18.590 --> 06:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
me and it's I will be referring to uh
 
06:03:22.970 --> 06:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:22.980 --> 06:03:24.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:03:24.650 --> 06:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:26.810 --> 06:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
we got the budget on the 15th of
 
06:03:28.910 --> 06:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
February on time
 
06:03:31.010 --> 06:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
hb2 I would like to have looked at at
 
06:03:32.510 --> 06:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
06:03:34.368 --> 06:03:34.378 align:start position:0%
and it got delivered on April on
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
February 15th but it got delivered to
 
06:03:36.240 --> 06:03:38.270 align:start position:0%
February 15th but it got delivered to
OLS

06:03:38.270 --> 06:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
OLS
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
I want to last sat there for two weeks
 
06:03:44.448 --> 06:03:44.458 align:start position:0%
going through with a fine-tooth Como 237
 
06:03:47.868 --> 06:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
pages of it to see if referring to see
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
if it referred to the proper law and to
 
06:03:52.548 --> 06:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
see if all the grammar was correct it
 
06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
took two weeks that I would like to have
 
06:03:57.230 --> 06:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
seen in the brief five or six weeks we
 
06:03:59.030 --> 06:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
have to do a budget to be able to look
 
06:04:02.448 --> 06:04:02.458 align:start position:0%
at hb2 during that time as well so what
 
06:04:05.930 --> 06:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
this amendment does it requires it to be
 
06:04:08.270 --> 06:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
publicly posted on the department of
 
06:04:10.670 --> 06:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
administrative services website on the
 
06:04:12.590 --> 06:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
date of transmittal
 
06:04:14.750 --> 06:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can look at it immediately
 
06:04:16.850 --> 06:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
and if they want to make some nitpicky
 
06:04:19.368 --> 06:04:19.378 align:start position:0%
little changes to it fine we'll we'll
 
06:04:21.110 --> 06:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
wait and look at those and see how much
 
06:04:24.048 --> 06:04:24.058 align:start position:0%
change there was but the basics of it I
 
06:04:26.690 --> 06:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
don't think will change tremendously and
 
06:04:30.288 --> 06:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
we need it before us at the same time we
 
06:04:32.448 --> 06:04:32.458 align:start position:0%
also need before us the revenue
 
06:04:35.090 --> 06:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
estimates which came two weeks late
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
we haven't fixed that in this bill we'll
 
06:04:39.708 --> 06:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
have to fix that internally with the
 
06:04:41.868 --> 06:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee but this would
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
at least have it available for us to
 
06:04:45.350 --> 06:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
look at
 
06:04:48.350 --> 06:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
and we can probably get if it's on a
 
06:04:50.270 --> 06:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
website and it's published we would be
 
06:04:52.070 --> 06:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
able to get published copies to look at
 
06:04:54.770 --> 06:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
as well so I'm hoping you'll adopt this
 
06:04:57.850 --> 06:04:57.860 align:start position:0%
it will go in the the
 
06:05:01.490 --> 06:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
hb2 is is kind of a commentary and it
 
06:05:04.250 --> 06:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
will go forward as we have done several
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
times with other things that we thought
 
06:05:09.170 --> 06:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
ought to be changed in in the budget and
 
06:05:11.410 --> 06:05:11.420 align:start position:0%
some of them have persisted for years
 
06:05:13.970 --> 06:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler representative
 
06:05:16.190 --> 06:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
McGuire has a question for you yeah I'm
 
06:05:17.868 --> 06:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
wondering if this maybe should be at the
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant website
 
06:05:22.250 --> 06:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
where all the other budget documents are
 
06:05:24.230 --> 06:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
collected rather than administrative
 
06:05:24.240 --> 06:05:25.610 align:start position:0%
collected rather than administrative
services

06:05:25.610 --> 06:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:05:28.310 --> 06:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
I'll have to talk to the LBA and see if
 
06:05:31.070 --> 06:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
they'd have room for it yeah Mr Hoffman
 
06:05:33.708 --> 06:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
we would most definitely post it we
 
06:05:36.410 --> 06:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
currently post the governor's Budget on
 
06:05:39.048 --> 06:05:39.058 align:start position:0%
a website and uh as soon as we have a
 
06:05:40.788 --> 06:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
house bill too so
 
06:05:42.410 --> 06:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
this would be an important budget
 
06:05:45.230 --> 06:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
document we put it out there
 
06:05:46.850 --> 06:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
so I think we're a good representative
 
06:05:46.860 --> 06:05:47.868 align:start position:0%
so I think we're a good representative
Weiler

06:05:47.868 --> 06:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
06:05:49.850 --> 06:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
so would you think it'd be more
 
06:05:52.548 --> 06:05:52.558 align:start position:0%
appropriate to put it on the on the LBA
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
website rather than the department of
 
06:05:55.788 --> 06:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
06:05:57.708 --> 06:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
well as this is written it would be good
 
06:05:59.810 --> 06:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
for administrative services to have it
 
06:06:01.788 --> 06:06:01.798 align:start position:0%
but we will too
 
06:06:05.330 --> 06:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:07.490 --> 06:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
all right show a hands the support of
 
06:06:10.930 --> 06:06:10.940 align:start position:0%
the Wilder Amendment I'll see unanimous
 
06:06:13.490 --> 06:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:06:15.708 --> 06:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
so the second amendment that I bring to
 
06:06:15.718 --> 06:06:16.788 align:start position:0%
so the second amendment that I bring to
you

06:06:16.788 --> 06:06:16.798 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:06:20.628 --> 06:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
is uh 1046
 
06:06:24.890 --> 06:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
this is a handy tool when we sit in
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
a fiscal committee as we do every month
 
06:06:29.390 --> 06:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
and people are coming in looking for
 
06:06:31.548 --> 06:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
money and we're sitting there wondering
 
06:06:33.410 --> 06:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
okay where's that going to come from and
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
usually they come from like the rainy
 
06:06:39.110 --> 06:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
day fund but before we hit the rainy day
 
06:06:39.120 --> 06:06:40.190 align:start position:0%
day fund but before we hit the rainy day
fund

06:06:40.190 --> 06:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
fund
 
06:06:42.410 --> 06:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
if we know of the lapses that haven't
 
06:06:45.048 --> 06:06:45.058 align:start position:0%
been spent throughout the budget that
 
06:06:47.090 --> 06:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
would be an easier place to get the
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
money that we know it won't be spent
 
06:06:51.770 --> 06:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
somebody cancel the contract or whatever
 
06:06:53.810 --> 06:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
happened so money lapsed from a certain
 
06:06:56.510 --> 06:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
agency it would that was General funds
 
06:06:58.190 --> 06:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
but lapse to the general fund or
 
06:06:59.510 --> 06:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
whatever fund we're looking for money
 
06:07:02.868 --> 06:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
for for requests at fiscal so this is
 
06:07:06.230 --> 06:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is a way to get those lapses done a
 
06:07:08.510 --> 06:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
little more quickly and when we meet
 
06:07:10.850 --> 06:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
every month on fiscal we could say oh
 
06:07:13.610 --> 06:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay we've got money here to cover what
 
06:07:16.670 --> 06:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
your request is without trying to go in
 
06:07:19.730 --> 06:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
in the in the red or or hit the rainy
 
06:07:22.070 --> 06:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
day fund so it would seem like a better
 
06:07:24.830 --> 06:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
source of the funds that the requests
 
06:07:27.288 --> 06:07:27.298 align:start position:0%
for fiscal and they're not usually huge
 
06:07:28.788 --> 06:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
funds but
 
06:07:30.350 --> 06:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
you know beer might be a few hundred
 
06:07:32.208 --> 06:07:32.218 align:start position:0%
thousand here or there so I thought this
 
06:07:34.250 --> 06:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
might be a good way have that money
 
06:07:34.260 --> 06:07:35.930 align:start position:0%
might be a good way have that money
available

06:07:35.930 --> 06:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:07:38.690 --> 06:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason for this that if we
 
06:07:40.610 --> 06:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
know what the lapses have been on fiscal
 
06:07:42.650 --> 06:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
then we can have a pretty good idea what
 
06:07:44.628 --> 06:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
we can hand out thank you represent
 
06:07:46.670 --> 06:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you does the department
 
06:07:46.680 --> 06:07:48.410 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you does the department
ever

06:07:48.410 --> 06:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
ever
 
06:07:50.330 --> 06:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
think they're going to lapse in one
 
06:07:52.128 --> 06:07:52.138 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and then in the next one
 
06:07:54.650 --> 06:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
oops they have some extra need and they
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
take back from their first year lap sort
 
06:07:59.330 --> 06:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
of and and you could have already spent
 
06:08:01.128 --> 06:08:01.138 align:start position:0%
it this way is that going to be a
 
06:08:03.170 --> 06:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
problem the only one we ever have seemed
 
06:08:05.750 --> 06:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
to have trouble on making the lapses and
 
06:08:08.510 --> 06:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
roughly we give you money we expect like
 
06:08:09.890 --> 06:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
a three or four it's three or four
 
06:08:12.590 --> 06:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
percent laps and okay so you know you're
 
06:08:14.330 --> 06:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
not going to spend 98 you're not going
 
06:08:17.330 --> 06:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
to spend 100 of it and you keep that in
 
06:08:19.850 --> 06:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
mind as you spend through the year and
 
06:08:21.650 --> 06:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
obviously when when you see some big
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
changes you say oh good that's that's
 
06:08:26.270 --> 06:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
money I won't have to worry about the
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
the HHS has always been the problem of
 
06:08:30.948 --> 06:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
course it's such a huge agency so many
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
different pages as you'll see in this
 
06:08:36.770 --> 06:08:36.780 align:start position:0%
budget that um Sometimes they come to us
 
06:08:39.650 --> 06:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
and say we're not going to make our laps
 
06:08:42.590 --> 06:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
so they're going to spend roughly 104 of
 
06:08:43.788 --> 06:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
what we think that we're going to spend
 
06:08:43.798 --> 06:08:45.288 align:start position:0%
what we think that we're going to spend
so

06:08:45.288 --> 06:08:45.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
that would be one that that would be
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
problematic and probably won't even make
 
06:08:52.190 --> 06:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
these reports
 
06:08:56.270 --> 06:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
but if the other the other 49 of the
 
06:08:58.910 --> 06:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
state agents spending
 
06:09:01.850 --> 06:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
then that should be enough to cover the
 
06:09:09.288 --> 06:09:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:12.070 --> 06:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions on the second
 
06:09:14.208 --> 06:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
Wilder Amendment
 
06:09:16.670 --> 06:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'll just put your hands up if you're
 
06:09:19.548 --> 06:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
okay with it we're good
 
06:09:22.430 --> 06:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much sorry I
 
06:09:23.990 --> 06:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't with you earlier today I hear you
 
06:09:26.330 --> 06:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
we're doing some very good work I saw
 
06:09:30.770 --> 06:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:33.530 --> 06:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
yeah it was work
 
06:09:36.830 --> 06:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
and he had a huge audience here too
 
06:09:39.250 --> 06:09:39.260 align:start position:0%
disciples too yeah
 
06:09:41.930 --> 06:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
Jackson's value is recycling very good
 
06:09:43.850 --> 06:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
all right I'm on break from division
 
06:09:46.128 --> 06:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire often draws a
 
06:09:47.708 --> 06:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
crowd we face
 
06:09:47.718 --> 06:09:50.470 align:start position:0%
crowd we face
yeah

06:09:50.470 --> 06:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:09:53.150 --> 06:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
he seems to be super energized then
 
06:09:54.708 --> 06:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
we're going to need that energy to get
 
06:09:56.868 --> 06:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
through this budget thank you
 
06:09:58.128 --> 06:09:58.138 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:10:01.910 --> 06:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative Weiler
 
06:10:05.330 --> 06:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
so it looks like if I'm not mistaken Mr
 
06:10:07.610 --> 06:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
Hoffman Melissa all these others that
 
06:10:09.590 --> 06:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
haven't been shaded are just adding the
 
06:10:11.628 --> 06:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts in which we discussed
 
06:10:13.970 --> 06:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
when we made those adjustments is that
 
06:10:13.980 --> 06:10:15.530 align:start position:0%
when we made those adjustments is that
correct

06:10:15.530 --> 06:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:10:18.530 --> 06:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
yes we just didn't record agreement on
 
06:10:20.330 --> 06:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
the complete budget for those agencies
 
06:10:22.910 --> 06:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
because there was still work being done
 
06:10:24.530 --> 06:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
on the additional requests in the house
 
06:10:26.448 --> 06:10:26.458 align:start position:0%
bill two items
 
06:10:29.868 --> 06:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
so for example a child advocate
 
06:10:31.670 --> 06:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
some of the additional requests were
 
06:10:34.610 --> 06:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
funded but we didn't get a nod on the
 
06:10:37.010 --> 06:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
budget as amended
 
06:10:39.048 --> 06:10:39.058 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll
 
06:10:42.770 --> 06:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
do the nod on
 
06:10:48.708 --> 06:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:50.868 --> 06:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
Treasury Department we just discussed
 
06:10:54.410 --> 06:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
that Revenue administration department
 
06:10:54.420 --> 06:10:55.250 align:start position:0%
that Revenue administration department
um

06:10:55.250 --> 06:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:58.250 --> 06:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
oh 84 are we okay with that the judicial
 
06:10:58.260 --> 06:10:59.930 align:start position:0%
oh 84 are we okay with that the judicial
Council

06:10:59.930 --> 06:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
Council
 
06:11:01.430 --> 06:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
below that
 
06:11:04.548 --> 06:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
zero seven
 
06:11:08.570 --> 06:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
we talked about Justice that's 2-0 and
 
06:11:12.350 --> 06:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
then human rights seven six
 
06:11:12.360 --> 06:11:18.948 align:start position:0%
then human rights seven six
Corrections

06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:21.650 --> 06:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission those additional
 
06:11:23.810 --> 06:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
requests approved
 
06:11:27.830 --> 06:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
business and economic affairs
 
06:11:31.490 --> 06:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
and environmental services
 
06:11:34.128 --> 06:11:34.138 align:start position:0%
so everybody okay show of hands with
 
06:11:36.110 --> 06:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
allowing the
 
06:11:38.150 --> 06:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
the only the only thing we showed is
 
06:11:40.610 --> 06:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
open was business and economic Affairs
 
06:11:44.208 --> 06:11:44.218 align:start position:0%
we had the Small Business Development
 
06:11:46.730 --> 06:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
Center on hold oh we had that on hold
 
06:11:46.740 --> 06:11:49.548 align:start position:0%
Center on hold oh we had that on hold
okay

06:11:49.548 --> 06:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:52.610 --> 06:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
we uh do we I mean I had suggested even
 
06:11:55.010 --> 06:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
just another 50 for them but I wasn't
 
06:12:00.128 --> 06:12:00.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:02.868 --> 06:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
instead of 390. I think they'd take
 
06:12:02.878 --> 06:12:05.150 align:start position:0%
instead of 390. I think they'd take
anything

06:12:05.150 --> 06:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:09.110 --> 06:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
further comments you suggesting a firm
 
06:12:09.120 --> 06:12:09.890 align:start position:0%
further comments you suggesting a firm
number

06:12:09.890 --> 06:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
number
 
06:12:12.708 --> 06:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
yeah so it would be in well I said I
 
06:12:15.948 --> 06:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
think they are they have 390 what if we
 
06:12:19.390 --> 06:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah sbdc
 
06:12:24.770 --> 06:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
Small Business Development
 
06:12:28.010 --> 06:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
yes represents Sweeney so I I remember
 
06:12:31.628 --> 06:12:31.638 align:start position:0%
this fund request to hire in a
 
06:12:34.490 --> 06:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
advisor for biotech
 
06:12:36.230 --> 06:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
is that what
 
06:12:39.890 --> 06:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
this group right no they they weren't
 
06:12:39.900 --> 06:12:41.270 align:start position:0%
this group right no they they weren't
what

06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:12:44.690 --> 06:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
we had a letter though Melissa Mr
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:52.850 --> 06:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
this is an organization that helps
 
06:12:55.548 --> 06:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
um small businesses get started they've
 
06:12:57.770 --> 06:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
had an appropriation for in the past two
 
06:13:00.770 --> 06:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
budgets I think the request is to bring
 
06:13:02.628 --> 06:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
them up to five hundred thousand dollars
 
06:13:04.910 --> 06:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
and they're at 390 in the budget right
 
06:13:07.430 --> 06:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
now right and and they were here and
 
06:13:09.770 --> 06:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
then I asked Taylor
 
06:13:12.470 --> 06:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell about it and he
 
06:13:14.868 --> 06:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
supported the increase he felt that they
 
06:13:18.548 --> 06:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
did really good work they had requested
 
06:13:22.070 --> 06:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
500 in the and the governor put in 390.
 
06:13:22.080 --> 06:13:23.690 align:start position:0%
500 in the and the governor put in 390.
so

06:13:23.690 --> 06:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:13:25.610 --> 06:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney so I found the
 
06:13:25.620 --> 06:13:26.390 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney so I found the
letter

06:13:26.390 --> 06:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
letter
 
06:13:28.930 --> 06:13:28.940 align:start position:0%
so should the legislature increase
 
06:13:31.430 --> 06:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
sbdc's annual state funding allocation
 
06:13:36.530 --> 06:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 24 and 25 to 500 000 sbdc
 
06:13:38.570 --> 06:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
will hire a full-time business advisor
 
06:13:40.548 --> 06:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
to support the growing Biotech Industry
 
06:13:43.430 --> 06:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the greater Manchester region
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh Army and UNH Manchester set aside 50
 
06:13:50.930 --> 06:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
000 a year for four years for SPD so
 
06:13:53.090 --> 06:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
that's where I pulled my assumption
 
06:13:55.010 --> 06:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
that's right and then didn't you to ask
 
06:13:56.628 --> 06:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
them whether it would be limited to
 
06:13:59.030 --> 06:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester and they said no I did they
 
06:14:03.410 --> 06:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
said it would be a Statewide scope so my
 
06:14:06.590 --> 06:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
only hesitance on it is biotech is such
 
06:14:09.470 --> 06:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
a profitable business so they may not
 
06:14:11.510 --> 06:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
need that I I just feel the industry
 
06:14:14.690 --> 06:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
itself can find the funds as opposed to
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
pulling general fund dollars for that
 
06:14:19.730 --> 06:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
position that's my view on it
 
06:14:21.830 --> 06:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah and he
 
06:14:23.690 --> 06:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
obviously didn't convince the governor
 
06:14:26.208 --> 06:14:26.218 align:start position:0%
who's probably a soft touch on this kind
 
06:14:29.570 --> 06:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
of thing so I just I I had committed to
 
06:14:33.410 --> 06:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
raise it again so I did thank you
 
06:14:36.350 --> 06:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
all right so there's your answer Melissa
 
06:14:37.730 --> 06:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
and Mike
 
06:14:40.368 --> 06:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
on that uh
 
06:14:42.910 --> 06:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
there's one there's one other item
 
06:14:46.570 --> 06:14:46.580 align:start position:0%
representative evil it wants a
 
06:14:49.490 --> 06:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
indulgeable what we did discuss it a
 
06:14:53.390 --> 06:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:57.770 --> 06:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
just um if you go back to hb2 section
 
06:15:02.090 --> 06:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
um 84 it's on page three of this thingy
 
06:15:05.930 --> 06:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask you guys where it
 
06:15:08.030 --> 06:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
says regarding the Christa McAuliffe
 
06:15:12.530 --> 06:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
Memorial it says delete sections
 
06:15:14.868 --> 06:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
I don't think we planned on just
 
06:15:18.230 --> 06:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:21.650 --> 06:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the funding
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
so if you look at section 83 right above
 
06:15:30.110 --> 06:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
where you're you're talking about yeah
 
06:15:32.208 --> 06:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
um that was the Christa McAuliffe
 
06:15:34.970 --> 06:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
Memorial that was creating the
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
commission to discuss the statute
 
06:15:40.910 --> 06:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the next section was the
 
06:15:42.288 --> 06:15:42.298 align:start position:0%
appropriation would you agree on the
 
06:15:43.910 --> 06:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
next section is the effective dates of
 
06:15:46.070 --> 06:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
both of those it was just into one line
 
06:15:47.390 --> 06:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
so we said Paul the effective date
 
06:15:48.770 --> 06:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
because if it's not an effective date
 
06:15:50.690 --> 06:15:50.700 align:start position:0%
for that section it just goes naturally
 
06:15:53.628 --> 06:15:53.638 align:start position:0%
to June 30th correct correct the only
 
06:15:55.190 --> 06:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
reason needed that effective date and
 
06:15:57.230 --> 06:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
the only reason for June 30th was
 
06:16:00.830 --> 06:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
because there was an FY 23 appropriation
 
06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
so now the language in the first section
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
will remain with the July 1st effective
 
06:16:06.958 --> 06:16:09.590 align:start position:0%
will remain with the July 1st effective
date

06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:12.590 --> 06:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
zero zero so
 
06:16:14.930 --> 06:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
so that was one of the things I just
 
06:16:16.368 --> 06:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk to the committee about
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
maybe we could put a hundred thousand in
 
06:16:21.890 --> 06:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
it or just something to get them going
 
06:16:24.650 --> 06:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
um there's a great deal of feeling among
 
06:16:27.830 --> 06:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
people that uh several of us have been
 
06:16:29.990 --> 06:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
hearing from that we really would like
 
06:16:33.288 --> 06:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
to just she I mean obviously Krista
 
06:16:37.250 --> 06:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
McAuliffe is an iconic person and to get
 
06:16:39.948 --> 06:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
the process going the governor certainly
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
was convinced that we should put 500 in
 
06:16:45.650 --> 06:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
maybe we could at least put in a hundred
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
or or whatever the division
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
thanks I I didn't want to let it go
 
06:16:55.190 --> 06:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
unremarked based on the input that I've
 
06:16:57.288 --> 06:16:57.298 align:start position:0%
gotten since our decision representative
 
06:17:03.110 --> 06:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:05.150 --> 06:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's been moved by representative Evil
 
06:17:07.128 --> 06:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative McGuire to
 
06:17:09.948 --> 06:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
add back a hundred thousand dollars to
 
06:17:11.150 --> 06:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
that line
 
06:17:11.160 --> 06:17:19.070 align:start position:0%
that line
discussion

06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:22.610 --> 06:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh okay we'll take we'll just have a
 
06:17:24.590 --> 06:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
show of hands everybody okay with that a
 
06:17:26.270 --> 06:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
06:17:28.340 --> 06:17:28.350 align:start position:0%
represent Cabral
 
06:17:28.350 --> 06:17:33.048 align:start position:0%
represent Cabral
[Laughter]

06:17:33.048 --> 06:17:33.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:37.670 --> 06:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:41.030 --> 06:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
six to one okay representative Sweeney
 
06:17:42.650 --> 06:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
06:17:45.948 --> 06:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
McGuire made a comment and did uh
 
06:17:49.128 --> 06:17:49.138 align:start position:0%
cause my brain gear to start moving uh
 
06:17:50.810 --> 06:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
do we need a formal Amendment for the
 
06:17:54.590 --> 06:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
housing portion of hb2 I think we we
 
06:17:58.670 --> 06:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
moved it right I changed the policy and
 
06:18:07.490 --> 06:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:07.500 --> 06:18:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:18:08.510 --> 06:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:10.910 --> 06:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's the one for Grant so we have sent
 
06:18:13.490 --> 06:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
that out to OLS it's the one removing
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
the loans in the Housing Development
 
06:18:16.670 --> 06:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
keeping the grants and the
 
06:18:19.490 --> 06:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities and then 15 and 15. yes
 
06:18:21.650 --> 06:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
we're moving 15 15. so we do have an
 
06:18:23.868 --> 06:18:23.878 align:start position:0%
amendment out to OLS for that okay
 
06:18:23.878 --> 06:18:37.070 align:start position:0%
amendment out to OLS for that okay
perfect

06:18:37.070 --> 06:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.890 --> 06:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
so do we have anything else uh Melissa
 
06:18:43.070 --> 06:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:44.948 --> 06:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
oh we have
 
06:18:47.570 --> 06:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
wow so
 
06:18:50.750 --> 06:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're just going to recess this our work
 
06:18:54.110 --> 06:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
session until a time probably Friday
 
06:18:57.230 --> 06:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
just in case Friday at 9 30 but we
 
06:18:59.510 --> 06:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
probably won't have to get together but
 
06:18:59.520 --> 06:19:00.430 align:start position:0%
probably won't have to get together but
so

06:19:00.430 --> 06:19:00.440 align:start position:0%

06:19:34.270 --> 06:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
we have until Friday
 
06:19:37.128 --> 06:19:37.138 align:start position:0%
yeah so actually
 
06:19:40.190 --> 06:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
I have facilities I forget I think at
 
06:19:42.470 --> 06:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
nine on Friday morning and they're gonna
 
06:19:45.470 --> 06:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
go over the legislative budget then
 
06:19:47.390 --> 06:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
are you on that Joe
 
06:19:47.400 --> 06:19:51.830 align:start position:0%
are you on that Joe
oh

06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:53.990 --> 06:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
so it's possible at 9 30 somebody will
 
06:19:55.730 --> 06:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
be here and recess the hearing until
 
06:20:02.090 --> 06:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:02.100 --> 06:20:07.730 align:start position:0%
 
24.

06:20:07.730 --> 06:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:11.570 --> 06:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right 1pm so we'll do it at
 
06:20:20.930 --> 06:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:22.970 --> 06:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so we'll
 
06:20:27.410 --> 06:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
be here at recess until 10 a.m on Friday
 
06:20:30.470 --> 06:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah again thank you all yes
 
06:20:33.170 --> 06:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yes I I want to
 
06:20:36.230 --> 06:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
say something I an organization day I
 
06:20:37.970 --> 06:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
went to representative walner and
 
06:20:40.730 --> 06:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and I said is it
 
06:20:43.368 --> 06:20:43.378 align:start position:0%
possible that we can get a bipartisan
 
06:20:45.948 --> 06:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
budget because
 
06:20:48.170 --> 06:20:48.180 align:start position:0%
um clearly you know we need one to pass
 
06:20:48.180 --> 06:20:49.788 align:start position:0%
um clearly you know we need one to pass
and

06:20:49.788 --> 06:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:53.030 --> 06:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
um they both said yes and that that in
 
06:20:55.670 --> 06:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
the past we had had bipartisan budgets
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I really enjoyed this experience it
 
06:21:02.570 --> 06:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
was my fourth time uh on the on finance
 
06:21:05.030 --> 06:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
but the first time in division one and I
 
06:21:06.970 --> 06:21:06.980 align:start position:0%
thought we really worked well together
 
06:21:11.030 --> 06:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I think we you know gave into give
 
06:21:13.850 --> 06:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
and take and um I hope we do have a
 
06:21:17.208 --> 06:21:17.218 align:start position:0%
bipartisan budget that at least some at
 
06:21:19.610 --> 06:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
least you know 190 or whatever from both
 
06:21:25.010 --> 06:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:27.410 --> 06:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh thanks representative McGuires I've
 
06:21:29.330 --> 06:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
said this before it was it's been a real
 
06:21:31.670 --> 06:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
pleasure working with everyone I get to
 
06:21:33.770 --> 06:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
know Chuck a little better we haven't
 
06:21:35.868 --> 06:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
really crossed paths much outside of
 
06:21:38.930 --> 06:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
here and uh representative cambrell's I
 
06:21:40.010 --> 06:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
was worried I wouldn't be able to
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
pronounce your name I had to practice
 
06:21:43.788 --> 06:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
for a few days
 
06:21:45.830 --> 06:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
and I certainly recognize you from
 
06:21:47.690 --> 06:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
Science and Technology a great addition
 
06:21:50.868 --> 06:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
and Joe all your work and trying to
 
06:21:52.970 --> 06:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
bring us together I think it's worked
 
06:21:53.990 --> 06:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
well and
 
06:21:56.510 --> 06:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
I've always known you to be a very
 
06:21:59.448 --> 06:21:59.458 align:start position:0%
thorough thinker you know you and I
 
06:22:02.628 --> 06:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate and Jerry's been on division
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
one a couple of terms a real anchor in
 
06:22:08.090 --> 06:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
getting things done and Karen being our
 
06:22:10.548 --> 06:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
Public Works expert was a big benefit
 
06:22:13.548 --> 06:22:13.558 align:start position:0%
having her here and so I can't say thank
 
06:22:15.948 --> 06:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
you to Dave Hewitt but we still have a
 
06:22:18.110 --> 06:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
long way to go we've got to present this
 
06:22:20.270 --> 06:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
or Dean and I will present this to the
 
06:22:22.368 --> 06:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
for our recommendations to the full
 
06:22:24.890 --> 06:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
Committee in the next week and then
 
06:22:26.448 --> 06:22:26.458 align:start position:0%
we'll do it on the floor of the house
 
06:22:28.430 --> 06:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
06:22:31.250 --> 06:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
we should have bipartisan support at
 
06:22:34.670 --> 06:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
least some at least anyway enough we'll
 
06:22:37.010 --> 06:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
see thank you very much Mr chair I'd
 
06:22:39.770 --> 06:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
just like to say uh thank you to you and
 
06:22:41.510 --> 06:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
and representative McGuire for your
 
06:22:43.910 --> 06:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
leadership getting us through this and
 
06:22:46.548 --> 06:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
you know keeping us driving and uh as a
 
06:22:48.948 --> 06:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
rookie here as a fresh a freshman in
 
06:22:50.990 --> 06:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
this committee uh you welcome me with
 
06:22:53.330 --> 06:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
open arms and I can't tell you how much
 
06:22:56.690 --> 06:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:59.030 --> 06:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
all right well I guess I should say
 
06:23:01.850 --> 06:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
something oh you're competing with a
 
06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire well I just I
 
06:23:06.170 --> 06:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
just want to say that I was a veteran
 
06:23:08.090 --> 06:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
for 10 years of Public Works and
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
highways so I wasn't sure how it would
 
06:23:13.128 --> 06:23:13.138 align:start position:0%
be here we were very bipartisan over
 
06:23:16.070 --> 06:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
there we have been bipartisan here I've
 
06:23:18.948 --> 06:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
enjoyed it I've I say that guardedly
 
06:23:20.990 --> 06:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
even with one thing I think we've
 
06:23:23.030 --> 06:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
learned a lot I've really enjoyed
 
06:23:25.548 --> 06:23:25.558 align:start position:0%
getting to know you guys and um I look
 
06:23:27.410 --> 06:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
forward to working with you in the
 
06:23:30.590 --> 06:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
future and thank you very much also for
 
06:23:32.810 --> 06:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
welcoming me and
 
06:23:34.868 --> 06:23:34.878 align:start position:0%
letting me use my pen
 
06:25:34.250 --> 06:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:34.260 --> 06:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
