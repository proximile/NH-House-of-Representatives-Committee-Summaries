williams
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so i would open
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
hb 405 which is
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
relative to beer and refillable seniors
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
and i see no hands from the committee
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i see no hands from
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
the attendees and everyone uh hopefully
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
is familiar with the hand raising
 
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.070 align:start position:0%
is familiar with the hand raising
mechanism

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
and zoom so if you choose to speak
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
please use the zoom hand raise
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
to indicate that you want to speak so
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
since this is my bill i'll
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
i will speak on it this this bill
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
is one that uh has always been quite
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
popular in the house
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
has passed the house by a wide margin
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
300 votes or more
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
typically and uh but we've always
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
struggled with it on the senate side
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
and so this time we decided we weren't
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't quite ready
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
and needs to have some additional uh
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
work done
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh to make it uh universally attractive
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh so um i would
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
consider this uh a bill that we should
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
do when we obviously passed
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh a temporary um bill
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
around growlers uh
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
based on the restaurants struggling in
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and and i think that
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
there will continue to be issues for
 
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.110 align:start position:0%
there will continue to be issues for
restaurants

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
and anything that we can do to make
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh give restaurants
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
um additional business would be
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
would be useful and this has always been
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
to me a a bill that's uh
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
really intended for consumers it gives
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
consumers the option
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
if they choose to get fresh beer
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
as a takeout item uh
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
instead of buying a beer that's been
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
packaged at the factory which
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
does have a different taste to it and
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
if you want a particular brand um
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
especially from the smaller uh breweries
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily want to be able to
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
one have to drive you know 100 miles or
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
more to get to that brewery but if you
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
can get it from
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
a local restaurant or a
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
a beer specialty store there's
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
definitely a benefit
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
so um i will
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
attempt going forward to make this
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh bill more accessible uh more
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
interesting to
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
the small companies who who have been
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
the main obstacle on the senate side
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and ms smarling i don't see uh
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative hunt has his hand raised
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's when you didn't see a hand
 
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:16.830 align:start position:0%
there's a hand
 
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.790 align:start position:0%
there's a hand
[Laughter]

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
right i thought it was appropriate to
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
let representative williams speak
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
first so um so obviously i have
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
supported the
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
concept of growlers in the past and
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
um and certainly agree
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we would like to do
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
something uh to offer this opportunity
 
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.230 align:start position:0%
something uh to offer this opportunity
but

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'm i'm i'm a little cautious
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
about today's vote
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
because when we say recommend or not
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
recommend for mutual legislation and
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's true there's a blurb that goes with
 
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
it's true there's a blurb that goes with
it

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
um what has occurred uh certainly in
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
this year is
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
a whole myriad of new issues have come
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
up around
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
the concept of the growlers and the
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
benefit to the growlers to
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
let's say the the restaurant and lodging
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
we're not lodging with a restaurant
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know uh lobby group and so the issue
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
being that uh boy it would have been
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
nice if they had it they could get rid
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
of their beer all right
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
um i would say i would counter to what
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
you one comment you made which is
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
that it's a different growler beer is
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
different than what you would get
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
um you know from bottled beer or canned
 
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
um you know from bottled beer or canned
beer

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
beer
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
um but it's not different than the cake
 
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.750 align:start position:0%
um but it's not different than the cake
beer

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
beer
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh growler beer is you know in terms of
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
when are they with the keges whether
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
um filtered and fermented they um
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
the filtering process that uh many
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
growler bills
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
growlers are not and that's the reason
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
why they like growler so this is that
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's a much more pure beer and has
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
not been pasteurized
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
which is what you're going to get in a
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
keg which is what you're going to go to
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
the grocery stores
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
so the long shot the short of it is um
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
i'm i i was okay with uh retaining this
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
bill with the assumption
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to get a chance to work
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
on it and try to figure out something
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to make this
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
work and certainly get senators and you
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
know involved or so you know in terms of
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what the issue is
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not so much the senate
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's the action the reality is it's the
 
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.069 align:start position:0%
it's the action the reality is it's the
small

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
custom brewers so obviously
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
theoretically a large brewer would not
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
have a problem with this um
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know they they got the kegs they're
 
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
pushing them out they're more than happy
 
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.470 align:start position:0%
pushing them out they're more than happy
to

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh if uh and you know retail and then we
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
haven't even talked about the difference
 
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
haven't even talked about the difference
between

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh on-premise licensing versus
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
off-premise licenses
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
um when you say you know here we're
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
talking about you know you're talking
 
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
about an
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
on-premise licensee um but you know
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of on
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
off premises you know grocery stores
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
they would like to have it too you know
 
00:14:48.079 --> 00:14:48.629 align:start position:0%
they would like to have it too you know
and

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
and that that's the one was a big
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
pushback by the commission
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
um worry about the pipes cleaning
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
worrying about the controls over there's
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know all these myriad of issues that
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
are going on with this
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
this bill so i gets down to what i would
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
call the uh rule of thumb for
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
liquor bills and that is who is there's
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
this general demand push
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
for something okay in other words we are
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to liquid laws where
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
mother may i
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we do what people you know they say
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
well we really want this i really need
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's a need for it
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
the reality is the growlers is not a
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
problem for anybody to get a growler
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to go very far to
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
get one um we have
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know you know we think of the nanos
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
we got 20 some plus
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
nanos we got brewers are popping up
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
every day
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
and so anybody can go get a growler and
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
frankly those custom brewers are
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy doing it that way
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
because they make more money if you go
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
buy it from them
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
and not through uh you know putting it
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
in a keg and throwing it to a
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
to a retailer or off-premise license or
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
on-premise license here whichever we end
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
up choosing
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
so i i'm at the point now i don't really
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
see the customer demand for growlers
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh if a customer wants a growler they
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
really don't have to drive far to go get
 
00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:04.629 align:start position:0%
really don't have to drive far to go get
one

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
and and so i i think at this point
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
unless there is a great outcry from
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
the cut the small brewers the people who
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
are actually we would want to
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
benefit to the small the small custom
 
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:17.670 align:start position:0%
benefit to the small the small custom
brewers

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
brewers
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
unless there's someone will cry for them
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
to do this bill i just think it's
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
it's time to give growlers a rest for a
 
00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
it's time to give growlers a rest for a
while

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh and not you know not bother bringing
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
something in next year because
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
you you know the times you know if
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to bring the bill in you're
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
bringing the same language
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to have the same problem we
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
had this year or last year you know
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
every year um you know we it really you
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
know we had a study committee once
 
00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:40.710 align:start position:0%
know we had a study committee once
already

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
and they didn't they didn't come up with
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
anything right i mean there was no there
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
was no resolution
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
and so you know this is an issue that i
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
i just think that
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
it it at this point it's we're better
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
off just leave a sleeping dog lie
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hunt and i see
 
00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.069 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hunt and i see
a

00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%

our group sure you also saw that you
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%

representative patusek was first and
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%

uh i have been contacted over the over
 
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.950 align:start position:0%
uh i have been contacted over the over
this

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
period of time uh by a couple of the
 
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.470 align:start position:0%
period of time uh by a couple of the
local

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh micro nano brewers uh as you know
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
dairy in londonderry have a
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
ton of local brewers and
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
none of them seem to feel that they
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
really needed this bill
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
back in the day when it was started yeah
 
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.549 align:start position:0%
back in the day when it was started yeah
but

00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
lately and locally they don't
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
see a need for it thank you
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
and representative van halen thank you
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
um i i tend to agree with the two
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
previous speakers
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
the issues that were never really
 
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
resolved when we first heard the bill
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
include things like sanitation how do we
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
keep the
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
the growlers sanitary moving forward uh
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
the advent or the advent of the
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
popularity of canned beers
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
coming in so i think the face of of the
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
market that we're looking at here that
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deal with as as
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned really has seen its heyday and
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
um i
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't see that moving this bill forward
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
at this time or at least putting it
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
forward in terms of a recommendation to
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
move it forward
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
is in the best interests of of the group
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
so i would remind you all that uh there
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
are 33 states that have that allow
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
other other entities besides the people
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
who produce the beer
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
to fill growlers you go to new york
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
state and almost
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
you can find brawler filling stations
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
all over the place
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
and they don't have issues uh
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
with sanitation or with
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
concerns from the small brewers i mean
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
you guys
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
both mentioned the small brewers
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
they are actually the ones who uh have
 
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.310 align:start position:0%
they are actually the ones who uh have
objected

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
objected
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
really the only ones who objected to the
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
growler bill in the past
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
and that was because as representative
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
punt said
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
they make more money filling growlers
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
than if they sell
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
their beer in a keg or in a can because
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
essentially a retail price for something
 
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.150 align:start position:0%
essentially a retail price for something
um

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
but i i think that i so i continue to
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
have people talk to me who are consumers
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
who would like to be able to do this uh
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative hunt says you can get a
 
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
representative hunt says you can get a
growler

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
growler
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
um not very far from your home but
 
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.270 align:start position:0%
um not very far from your home but
that's

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
that may be true it depends on where you
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
live obviously but that means you're
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
getting it from the closest brewery to
 
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
getting it from the closest brewery to
you

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't happen to like their beer
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
versus someone else's beer
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know if i live in wilton and i but i
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
happen to like beer from moat mountain
 
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.870 align:start position:0%
happen to like beer from moat mountain
in

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
in ed's area um that means i have to
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
drive you know
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
almost 100 miles to to get my beer
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
so aidan moore if uh
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
the representative abel has his hand up
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
follow that good policy of talking to
 
00:20:46.559 --> 00:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
follow that good policy of talking to
our

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
or calling on our reps first and then
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
the audience
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
i would call on representative abel
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
thank you um i think that we
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
should recommend uh this uh this
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
build for uh reintroduction
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
next year um considering the fact that
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
there was a strong testimony
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of this this is a long-term
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh bill uh i think at least this
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
at least three times this bill has come
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
up before us
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
um and because there were only
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
a few uh
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
a few things that that were still
 
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.870 align:start position:0%
a few things that that were still
controversial

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor believes that we can
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
we can um find solutions to those
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
i think that we should and they
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
recommend that he go ahead and and and
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i think the bill will come back
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
whether we recommend it or not
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i would like
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
you're muted thank you um
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
i have to agree with representative van
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
houten um
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
i think that there were other issues on
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
this i do
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
with particularly with the pandemic and
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
cleanliness issues that are you know
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to be we're going to be addressing
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that this one's ready
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
to come back and i think
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm going to vote against
 
00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm going to vote against
recommending

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
pam legislation you uh promote uh mr
 
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:42.870 align:start position:0%
pam legislation you uh promote uh mr
moore

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
moore
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
so he can speak to us absolutely
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee members uh can
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
you hear me okay
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i guess i have
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
more uh of a question for you
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative williams
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
and and i'm not sure for the benefit of
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
as you may or may not recall hospital
 
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.750 align:start position:0%
as you may or may not recall hospital
405

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
405
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
was had a number of uh
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
issues in it that were of concern to us
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
at the liquor commission um such as
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
putting us into the position of kind of
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
almost becoming a
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
product integrity for the manufacturer
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh training and doing health uh training
 
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.990 align:start position:0%
uh training and doing health uh training
for

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
draft line maintenance and a few other
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
things so i
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
i i think there were a number of
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
concerns with 405 the way
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
it was drafted and i guess my question
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
to you representative williams is
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
is it your intention to bring 405 if the
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee were to
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
vote to reintroduce this to bring it
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
back as it currently
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
exists or are you going to
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
amend it in some way um
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure mr chairman uh you
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
you may or may not recall that at the
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
last legislative session
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1717 made it through the
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
rules committee to come to the floor
 
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.190 align:start position:0%
rules committee to come to the floor
which

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
was a bill that would allow
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
on-premise licensees to sell draft beer
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
if a pandemic existed
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that kind of languished i i don't
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
believe it ever
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
made it to any type of vote but i guess
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
my question representative williams is
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
is your intention to bring this back as
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
it is currently written
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
um sure happy to answer that question
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
and by the way we did vote on the on
 
00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:52.870 align:start position:0%
and by the way we did vote on the on
1717

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
1717
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
and passed it in um in the
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the house i not sure where it went
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
after that i don't think it went through
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
but um certainly i would not bring it
 
00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:05.190 align:start position:0%
but um certainly i would not bring it
back

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
as written um it needs to be
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
a different bill it needs to be modified
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
because the reason why it went to
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
interim study is because
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
there were concerns and i would
 
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.269 align:start position:0%
there were concerns and i would
certainly

00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
i recognize the the issues
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
that were added to the liquor
 
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.230 align:start position:0%
that were added to the liquor
commission's

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
commission's
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
set of responsibilities were mainly done
 
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.390 align:start position:0%
set of responsibilities were mainly done
because

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
there were concerns from the
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
draft system cleaning
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
and and some other things um
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not it's not clear to me that that
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns because
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
having researched how the 33 states that
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
allow growlers to be filled by people
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
the industry there don't seem to be
 
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.430 align:start position:0%
the industry there don't seem to be
anybody

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
else that there isn't seem to be anybody
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
else who is
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know requiring the training on
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
cleaning and those kinds of things
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
but i i would certainly if i bring this
 
00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
but i i would certainly if i bring this
back

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%

1300
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
which is relative to the definition of

specialty cider
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh who would like to speak on this bill

me so uh i'll recognize it
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
so uh yes i am the sponsor of this bill
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
and i have good news
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh this the uh the primary issue of this
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
bill is no longer necessary
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
um you might require a remember that i
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
first started out was
 
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
that the uh issue was that when we
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
passed uh
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
allow in-state beverage manufacturers to
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
have a higher or higher content of
 
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.630 align:start position:0%
have a higher or higher content of
alcohol

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
it didn't include out-of-state and but
 
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
it didn't include out-of-state and but
now

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh we have a new legislation that just
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
got passed uh
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
you know but never came to the committee
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
we kind of missed out on the fund
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh but this bill was a senate bill and
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill will certainly allow
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
a cider manufacturer uh to be able to
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
bring in a higher alcohol content
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
from out of state into new hampshire so
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
at this point in time the bill is not
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
necessary so i move
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh not recommended for future
 
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.389 align:start position:0%

so uh house bill 1300 uh will go
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
on uh in the calendar as not recommended
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
and representative hunt you'll do uh
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
statements on the last two bills
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll move on to house bill
 
00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:01.030 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll move on to house bill
16

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
16
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
or 613 which is relative to mandatory
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
and who would like to speak or is anyone
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
who would like to speak on
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
i there so there is one hand in the
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
all i see is representative macbeth's
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
hand okay so uh
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcbeth thank you um
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
so i um this is a bill that i
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
would like to see go forward i think we
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
had compelling testimony
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
from people that had been injured by
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
um the fault of an uninsured or
 
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.230 align:start position:0%
um the fault of an uninsured or
underinsured

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
underinsured
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
driver in new hampshire um i know that
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh there was that
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
last minute or poll voting i'm in the
 
00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.870 align:start position:0%
last minute or poll voting i'm in the
house

00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
um which i i'd disregard as far as that
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
sincere interest over mandatory
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
insurance i don't think that members
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
really understood it although i
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate the effort to try to gauge
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
interest but this is a bill i'd like to
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
go forward just as a consumer
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
protection bill thank you
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
and representative bartlett thank you um
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
oh representative macbeth i really
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate your support on this one
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we have a motion on the
 
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.109 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we have a motion on the
floor

00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
do we we do not and well we will at the
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh of the discussion okay
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
um this is this is the uh work part of
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
thing and then we move on to the
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um i mean the hard part i
 
00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:49.670 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um i mean the hard part i
think

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
for me you know that i also that i feel
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
strongly that we should
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
not be the only state without mandatory
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
auto insurance
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
however with the insurance department
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
not in favor without insurance companies
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
not in favor and the town clerks
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
um also coming out in opposition
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
um it's really hard to to see how we
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
can do it in this form um i think that
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
there are other times when
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
maybe there's another way we can look
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
into it
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
but it just feels like new hampshire
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
has with this i think it was 13 times i
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
don't know my notes in front of me but i
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
think it's been
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
in front of us 13 times since 1991.
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
um in this form i don't think it's going
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
to move
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to have enough work
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
next term
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
to keep us all very busy so i'm i
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
against my better judgment
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
really i'm going to say i'm not going to
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
recommend this for
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
future legislation representative
 
00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:52.470 align:start position:0%
future legislation representative
williams

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
williams
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
um i apparently as a co-host can't raise
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
my hand so put me in the list please
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um representative abel first and
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
butler okay thank you um
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
i have to say that this bill has always
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
or this issue has always baffled me uh
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
i've lived in a lot of states and
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh mandatory uh automobile insurance was
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
in every one of them it seemed to work
 
00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:25.349 align:start position:0%
in every one of them it seemed to work
wonderfully

00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
wonderfully
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh it prevented a lot of the problems
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
that we heard
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of testimony
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
from people who had been injured and
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
suffered because they
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
were unable to collect from people who
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
were uninsured
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
um i did i have to say i didn't hear a
 
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.510 align:start position:0%
um i did i have to say i didn't hear a
single

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
single
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
good what i thought was a single good
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
reason for why we
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
when we had testimony before for why we
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
should keep the system the way it is now
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
i bet most people you know in new
 
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:00.150 align:start position:0%
i bet most people you know in new
hampshire

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't even realize this
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
is the case and they're
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
very surprised and adversely affected
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
um so um i i'm a very strong proponent
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
that we should have sexual law and i
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
still wait to hear reasons for why we
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm just presenting my point of view
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
and representative butler thank you um
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative abel in those states that
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
you have lived and i have lived uh where
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
it was mandatory
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
we may not have heard the problems
 
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
with uninsured motorists
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
because there was a law mandating it
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
however we've also heard in the
 
00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.349 align:start position:0%
however we've also heard in the
testimony

00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
from several different perspectives
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
that even in the states that have
 
00:39:57.119 --> 00:39:58.390 align:start position:0%
that even in the states that have
mandatory

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
requirement for auto insurance there are
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
several that
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
have uh more uninsured motorists than we
 
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.630 align:start position:0%
have uh more uninsured motorists than we
do

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
so the problem exists we may not have
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
heard about it in
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
those states that we lived in uh
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
that required it um i
 
00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh we put this bill in
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
for interim study because i believe
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's a real
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
um uh challenge to
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
creating a law if we are going to
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
mandate it that is going to be
 
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.710 align:start position:0%
mandate it that is going to be
successful

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
um uh those if
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
what uh we mandate is a minimum coverage
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
of 25 000
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
which is what is required as a minimum
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
for coverage in
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
many mandated states then that's not
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
achieve the coverage that some of those
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
people that we heard of
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
are going to need and they're still
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to be in the same situation that
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
they were in
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of recompense for the damages
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
that occurred to them
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that mandatory auto
 
00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.270 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that mandatory auto
insurance

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
um is the answer
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
to the problems that were brought to us
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
a nine percent uh
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh uninsured population in the state
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
and in some other states that mandate it
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
there is a percentage of uninsured
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
motorists that is greater than that
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
then i don't know that mandatory
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
insurance is the answer
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh i don't
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
you know uh i i will look forward to the
 
00:41:43.119 --> 00:41:44.309 align:start position:0%
you know uh i i will look forward to the
solution

00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
that uh the new hampshire legislature
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
comes up with
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
so i would i would agree uh
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
with representative butler that as the
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill was written
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
and and you know rewriting it is a
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
difficult problem
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
but as the bill was written it really
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to provide much
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
help for the motorist who
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
is injured by an uninsured motorist
 
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
is injured by an uninsured motorist
because

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
even if that motorist the motorist is
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
not likely to choose to you know buy
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollars worth of
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
liability if they're
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
going from uninsured to insured they're
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
gonna buy them the minimum
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh which as representative butler said
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
would probably be twenty or twenty
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand dollars um and that
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
won't make that much difference in terms
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
of them recovering from their injuries
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
in fact they're more likely to benefit
 
00:42:38.319 --> 00:42:39.270 align:start position:0%
in fact they're more likely to benefit
from

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the rule which requires the
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
insurance company to provide uninsured
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
motorist coverage
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's the equivalent of the liability
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
coverage that an individual carries and
 
00:42:50.319 --> 00:42:51.510 align:start position:0%
coverage that an individual carries and
so

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
people who are concerned about uninsured
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
motorists should have lots of liability
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
coverage because then if they are struck
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
by an uninsured motorist they'll
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
get that uh coverage which won't pay
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
them for pain and suffering but will
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
certainly pay them for
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
medical costs um and
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh somebody mentioned i think maybe
 
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
christie mentioned the
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
town clerks uh and and that's
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
the way the bill was written it put a
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
burden on
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh tom clerks to be basically enforcing
 
00:43:26.069 --> 00:43:26.079 align:start position:0%
this law um i think that
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
is something that i don't know if that's
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
what happens in other states
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's possible that that you have to
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
show proof of insurance to register a
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
car but
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's not something that uh has been in
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
the process here
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
ever and so i think it makes it very
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
difficult for people to deal with that
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a way to do this i'm not
 
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
sure what that is
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
and certainly the way the bill was
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
written i don't think we can move
 
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.150 align:start position:0%
written i don't think we can move
forward

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
i would call on representative indrik
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative williams i
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
all of the concerns everyone has
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
expressed and recognized that this would
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
easy to create a
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
form that would be easily passable and
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
reconcilable between all the different
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
parties i did just want to
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
as a representative from a more densely
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
settled area
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
did want to recognize that there are
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
many individuals particularly in nashua
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
who are pedestrians and do not have auto
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
insurance and as such
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
do not have that possibility of having
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
an uninsured motorist coverage
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
to their own policy and it is certainly
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
something that every summer when i see
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
folks out on their bikes and out walking
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
around the streets and people speeding
 
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.390 align:start position:0%
around the streets and people speeding
by

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh to me i cringe and i think what
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
happens when
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
one of these poor individuals on their
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
way to work gets uh
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
into a vehicular accident with a
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
uninsured motorist
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
and is certainly something that weighs
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
on my mind and i see becoming
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
more pressing issue in this area as we
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
continue to grow and see more and more
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
commuting to work by bike or walking
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
and it is certainly something that
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
weighs on my mind and i would very much
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
like to see this state
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
join the 49 other states and do what i
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
think is the right thing however i
 
00:45:24.079 --> 00:45:25.030 align:start position:0%
think is the right thing however i
recognize

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
this is not an easy task and respect
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
everyone's decision accordingly
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thanks um
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative indrick brings up a
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
really good point regarding coverage
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
under um um for pedestrians or bike
 
00:45:41.359 --> 00:45:42.309 align:start position:0%
under um um for pedestrians or bike
riders

00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
riders
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm just putting in two cents
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
to guard as i know i'm not going to win
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
this battle um
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
but the minimum limits are rarely
 
00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
they usually their much higher limits
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
are sold right off the bat
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
um because there's not a lot of
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
what you pay for minimum limits than
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
what you pay for
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
higher limits but i i you know i i think
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
a battle that the way this bill is
 
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
a battle that the way this bill is
written

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
until in new hampshire decides to
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
become more automated because
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
used to make it much more difficult to
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
prove insurance and it's all automated
 
00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
prove insurance and it's all automated
now

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
we're just not there um as far as
 
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.990 align:start position:0%
we're just not there um as far as
monitoring

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
so i i i give up
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
that's all representative hunt
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so not that i want to pick a
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
fight with you chrissy but
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
now it's actually the people who cannot
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
afford insurance are going to buy
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
the least expensive one and they're
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to buy the 25.50
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
and and and i think that i ironically in
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
because we don't have it mandatory so
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
the people every you know
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
someone someone who buys insurance the
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
insurance agent is going to
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
make them understand that you don't have
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
to buy this
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
but you're buying it to protect yourself
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
don't worry about the other guy
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
you're worried about yourself making
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
sure you have enough coverage
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
make sure you get the benefits that
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to need if you're in a
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
serious accident
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the reason why in new
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire we actually have
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
people with higher uh uh balance
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
you know higher amounts than other
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
states because
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
that conversation occurs and the only
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
reason it occurs is because we don't
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
have mandatory auto insurance
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know and you know let's face it if
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
it gets down to
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
making a choice of what you're going to
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
and insurance to buy what would we
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
rather people be buying
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
auto insurance or health insurance
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think i want them to buy the health
 
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.109 align:start position:0%
i think i want them to buy the health
insurance

00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%

00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%

uh uh passes motion passes
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll move on to house bill
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
1320 which establishes a renter's
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
insurance notification requirement
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
and so we're back in in work session
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
mode is it would anyone like to speak on
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm going to say i'm i
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
really feel strongly that
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
um the the tenant's lease
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
should state clearly that
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
the landlord's policy does not cover
 
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:10.390 align:start position:0%
the landlord's policy does not cover
them

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
for property damage or for liability
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
um that there is no coverage
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
under under the policy for the tenant
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
so i have got to recommend that this be
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward we had testimony from
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
um tenants that had absolutely no
 
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.069 align:start position:0%
um tenants that had absolutely no
understanding

00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
that they did not have insurance
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
coverage and it
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
affected them when tragedy hit
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
so i really feel that it there should be
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
just one sentence
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the lease agreement that says
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
we don't you know there's no coverage
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
for you and we recommend that you have
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
renters insurance
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
um while i feel definite sorry and
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
sadness for anyone who has any kind of a
 
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.270 align:start position:0%
sadness for anyone who has any kind of a
loss

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
loss
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure this type of legislation is
 
00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:08.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure this type of legislation is
necessary

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
nor does it accomplish the goals of
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
legislation per se
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
it is more education and perhaps it
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
should be elsewhere that we educate
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
renters about this but to put it into a
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
into a rental agreement is saying that
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know we don't we don't allow people
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
to understand what they're doing we
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
don't give them
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
credit for what they're doing and i also
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
need to just put a quick disclaimer here
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
when i first spoke on on this bill
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
whenever whenever we had the first work
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
session i was a land landlord landlady
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
land person let's go with that and i no
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
longer am
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
i simply think that this is something
 
00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:43.349 align:start position:0%
i simply think that this is something
that

00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
citizens need to be educated on and i do
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
agree they need to be educated on this
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe that that
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
legislation is the place for that to
 
00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:53.430 align:start position:0%
legislation is the place for that to
happen

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.589 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
williams

00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
williams
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
um i support this bill as another
 
00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.710 align:start position:0%
um i support this bill as another
consumer

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
um rights advocacy bill i think it's
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
very similar to some of the issues that
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
we had on the
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
story units contracts that we as a
 
00:53:09.599 --> 00:53:10.390 align:start position:0%
story units contracts that we as a
committee

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
rewrote and put in big bold or colored
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
highlighted terms
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
particular issues that we thought were
 
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.069 align:start position:0%
particular issues that we thought were
important

00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
to consumers that they might not realize
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i think i see this is another one of
 
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:22.230 align:start position:0%
and i think i see this is another one of
those

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
issues and i think particularly with the
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
scarcity of rental property in our state
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of renters are going to be you
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
know um
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
doing things quickly and might not be
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
able to get all the education they need
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and so i would just it's a one
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
sentence and it's uh
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
good for both the landlord and the
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
tenant and
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see it included thank you
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%

00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%

area of salem
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
where this the fires etc took place
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
and most of all the representatives that
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
are sponsors
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
had a chance to read it i also posted it
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
in facebook
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
any feedback whatsoever whether positive
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
or negative on this article
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
so uh it was nice that
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
i shared it with the folks but nobody
 
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.630 align:start position:0%
i shared it with the folks but nobody
said

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
we should have a vote for it or go
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
against it
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
well my i'm just going to
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
reiterate that landlords don't even know
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
that their insurance
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover their tenants only if they
 
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
do something grossly negligent
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
um and i think that it's protection for
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
the landlords as well
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know can i ask you representative
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
van outen when you were a landlady
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
did you have it in your lease
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
oops i did not
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
i i'm in my defendant i shouldn't say in
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
my defense i did inform them
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
that insurance was uh that i enjoyed the
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
building itself and not their contents
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
of the building
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
but to just tell them verbally is really
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
not enough people forget
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
well i think that that's true but we're
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
talking about adults who are renting
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
rental properties here and i'm really
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
not fighting you on this because i
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
really do believe that people should be
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
educated about their rights and their
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
consumer responsibilities
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm just not sure that that's
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
something that should be in the lease
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i do recall in part of this
 
00:55:42.079 --> 00:55:43.430 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i do recall in part of this
conversation

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
i had reached out to the new hampshire
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
housing authority to see if
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
there was a possibility of perhaps them
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
working with
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal aid to draft a
 
00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.510 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal aid to draft a
general

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
disclosure sheet similar to the lead
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
paint disclosure sheet
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
that could be distributed with leases
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
which obviously could take very many
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
different forms and could be required or
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
could be just accessible
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that that a a tool or
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
a resource such as that
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
could really provide the opportunity to
 
00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:14.309 align:start position:0%
could really provide the opportunity to
educate

00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
educate
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
both landlords and renters and be made
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
readily available and with the input of
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legal aid really could
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
contain lots of information that could
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
be beneficial
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
and it seems that that might be a way to
 
00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:30.069 align:start position:0%
and it seems that that might be a way to
avoid

00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
some of the concern about meddling in
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
rental agreements
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
and specifying particular language which
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
may or may not be appropriate
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
so i i would agree with that um i think
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
it isn't necessarily i think
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative van houden said it isn't
 
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.270 align:start position:0%
representative van houden said it isn't
this

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
isn't really a subject for legislation i
 
00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
isn't really a subject for legislation i
think

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
if we could get an agency like
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
legal aid or new hampshire housing or
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
someone else to
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
provide education and the distribution
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
of that information
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
i think it would be useful but i think
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
putting it into
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
the lease agreement which is what this
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill required
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
isn't really much help i i don't know
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
how many of you have recently read lease
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
agreements maybe maybe you you have
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative n out in a few
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
leased property but they tend to be
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
fairly long
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh depending on where this sits
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
in that lease agreement the renter may
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
not even
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
see it i i i can tell you that
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh people in general don't read
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
long legal agreements because they don't
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily understand them
 
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
and they're kind of boring and and
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
they figure that they don't have any
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
choice if they want to do whatever it is
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
that that agreement is for whether it's
 
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.270 align:start position:0%
that that agreement is for whether it's
to

00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
lease a an apartment or or buy a car
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
or whatever and so they just sign it um
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
and so certainly education
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
so that people are aware of you know
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
what their
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are and what their
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
liabilities are
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
is useful but i don't think the way the
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill was written
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh that problem is solved and i'm not
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
sure that legislation is the appropriate
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
way to do this
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
and i see representative abel's hand
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
rich you're muted
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative there there you go there
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
we go i've got it thank you
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um sorry um with the
 
00:58:41.119 --> 00:58:42.309 align:start position:0%
thank you um sorry um with the
understanding

00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
that what we're talking about
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
or what we would be voting on is not the
 
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.589 align:start position:0%
or what we would be voting on is not the
bill

00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
that we heard in in this year
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
but instead of the concept
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
i would like to encourage us to to
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh recommend that that uh
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
something be done and if and it
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
it could be as simple as having the
 
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.589 align:start position:0%
it could be as simple as having the
landlord

00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
pass out a short statement
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
that says you're not in you know we
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
don't insure you
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't have to be in the lease
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
agreement but if we recommend the bill
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
then the sponsors
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
would be encouraged to come back and do
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
that it would be simpler and i think
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
everybody would like it so i'm in favor
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
and representative williams yes so
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
um as i as i just said i don't believe
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is the appropriate
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
item for legislation and the thing that
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked about is what the
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism is here
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know are we going to have the
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general go after the
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
landlords because they they don't have
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
the proper information in their
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
lease agreements i mean there will there
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
will be no enforcement
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know i can i think i could state
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
that pretty clearly
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
and so therefore putting it into
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
legislation putting it into the
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
the rsas uh doesn't really make much
 
01:00:15.599 --> 01:00:16.549 align:start position:0%
the rsas uh doesn't really make much
sense

01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
um again and certainly i i support
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
100 what representative indrex said
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
which is encouraging
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh somebody to provide education um
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
you know getting landlords to distribute
 
01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:31.510 align:start position:0%
you know getting landlords to distribute
information

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh those are all useful but you know
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
putting in something that essentially
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
requires something to be put into
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
a lease agreement with with no teeth
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
with no enforcement nobody's going to
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know be checking those um i don't
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
think it makes sense so so i would move
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we do not recommend this for uh

yeah absolutely so we'll move on to
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1464. which
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
was relative to insurance coverage for
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
yoga therapy as an alternative or
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
and so we're back in work work session
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
mode is there anyone who would like to
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
speak on this
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative williams if i could uh
 
01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
representative williams if i could uh
comment

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative butler thank you um
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
this one is a challenge for me because
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
i uh have supported and
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
worked with alternative healthcare
 
01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.349 align:start position:0%
worked with alternative healthcare
therapies

01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
therapies
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
since early in my uh
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that this bill
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
is ready for prime time um
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh i think that uh there are so many
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
forms of yoga therapy
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
and there may be uh
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
some states that are currently covering
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
yoga therapy for certain interventions
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
but i think we need a lot more
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
uh understanding and work on this
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
and um others have
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh suggested that maybe there is a way
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
several alternative therapies so we've
 
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.630 align:start position:0%
several alternative therapies so we've
covered

01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
covered
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
acupuncture therapy and certainly
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
physical therapy is covered and
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
some other interventions
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh even when for massage medically
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh required are covered but i don't
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
think that there
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
is a comprehensive understanding
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
of alternative therapies and their
 
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.270 align:start position:0%
of alternative therapies and their
impact

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
and how they could be covered what is
 
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:34.839 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
an association and a process for
 
01:04:41.039 --> 01:04:42.390 align:start position:0%
an association and a process for
certification

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
um but uh i don't know that there is
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
that for yoga therapy
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
um so i don't
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
i don't see how we can support this
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
other than to say um it
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
is uh something that
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
needs to to we need to continue to work
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
for it but um i don't think it's this
 
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:08.549 align:start position:0%
for it but um i don't think it's this
bill

01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative um yeah
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
i was confused because i thought you
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
were going to say recommended for future
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation i know
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah so i i just want to make sure
 
01:05:26.079 --> 01:05:26.870 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah so i i just want to make sure
everybody

01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
stands as someone who's been around for
 
01:05:29.839 --> 01:05:30.470 align:start position:0%
stands as someone who's been around for
90

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
90
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
acupuncture is not a mandated benefit i
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
mean these are
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
these even physical therapy we had some
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
big long debates about the physical
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
therapy that's not
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
actually mandated it's not in the
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
statute um
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
so the the first question he always says
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
is has there actually been
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
a uh uh
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
the therapist or somebody who is
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
recommending yoga therapy
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
and their insurance company uh whoever
 
01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
that person had
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
or the patient refused to pay it do we
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
actually know that that actually
 
01:06:04.079 --> 01:06:05.029 align:start position:0%
actually know that that actually
occurred

01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
um so and i don't think we even got
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
there because i think we were kind of
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
bogged down in the hearing that there
 
01:06:09.839 --> 01:06:10.230 align:start position:0%
bogged down in the hearing that there
wasn't

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
any real certifications yet for
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
a yoga profession so we were kind of
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
like overwhelmed that that
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
compared to all our other mandates where
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's usually licensed and
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
and registered you know before they come
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
in and look for the mandate
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
so um all i'm saying is is that you know
 
01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:27.589 align:start position:0%
so um all i'm saying is is that you know
that

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
i i'm i wouldn't be surprised that there
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
plenty of people do get yoga therapy is
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
it you know for alternative
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it is available i'm sure some
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
of you are getting it just like they're
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
getting acupuncture and
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're getting other things um so i i
 
01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
if for us to even go anywhere this
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge needs to be gained or what the
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
issues are out there about uh
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
whether this is really a problem or not
 
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.069 align:start position:0%
whether this is really a problem or not
representative

01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um i actually have very little
 
01:06:59.910 --> 01:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
to add i think that the conversations
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
that have preceded my
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
statements now are exactly where i stand
 
01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:04.710 align:start position:0%
statements now are exactly where i stand
um

01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
i do i do see a lot of value to
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
different types of alternative therapies
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
but the efficacy of value for um for
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
yoga therapy has not been brought to us
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
know we don't see evaluations and
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
studies we see a variety of different
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
credentialing and licensing
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
among those who administer this type of
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
therapy and i think we're seeing in the
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
evolution of forms it's becoming a more
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
popular therapy
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that they're branching out
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
to dance therapy dance
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
yoga and so on so while i i applaud
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
um the ability of medicine to go into
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
other areas that can
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
maybe less invasively help people with
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
with medical issues with
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
um with pains and aches i i just don't
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is something that
 
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
we can move forward with
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
so um the city sitting on gel car now
 
01:07:59.430 --> 01:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
um i see the process of
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
the licensing process uh in a lot more
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
detail and
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think is an
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
issue is that if there isn't a license
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
or a board that somehow certifies uh
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners it'll be a lot more of a
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
struggle to get insurance companies to
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
to pay because insurance companies tend
 
01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
to pay because insurance companies tend
to

01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
want to to be able to without them doing
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
the work
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to verify that someone is
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
actually providing a service that is
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh useful to the patient that actually
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
provides some
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh some medical relief and
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
without any any process other than just
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
somebody saying i'm using this
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
uh practitioner for therapy
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
um that's probably not going to be
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
enough for an insurance company
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know something that's
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
mandated or not
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
um they're going to want to see a
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
licensing process i
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
it require i recall in the discussion
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
around this that there was some talk
 
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.390 align:start position:0%
around this that there was some talk
about

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
a study effort that was going to look at
 
01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
alternative therapies in
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
general and to try to come up with a
 
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.950 align:start position:0%
general and to try to come up with a
mechanism

01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
for putting those forward in a more
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
professional structure you know with
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
board of practitioners or something
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me as though that's
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
where this needs to go
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's probable that that
 
01:09:30.239 --> 01:09:30.789 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's probable that that
board

01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
or that study never actually finished
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
its work just like
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
most of those other studies didn't
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
finish their work because of the
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic but
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
i think that that's where we need to go
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
before we move forward and try to
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
require a one particular alternative
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
therapy representative williams before
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
you go on
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
um i would want to ask ms smarling um
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
to uh let the uh attendees know
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
how they can um raise their hand to
 
01:10:03.679 --> 01:10:04.709 align:start position:0%
how they can um raise their hand to
speak

01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
um just to make sure that everybody has
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
sure and i see the sponsor of this bill
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
in in the attendees list and perhaps
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
she'd like to speak on this
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i see her as well and um for the
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
attendees if you're on a
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
pc if you go down to the bottom of the
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
participants list if you go down to the
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
bottom of the list where you see all
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
your names uh for the attendees side
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
you should see a button that says raise
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
or else maybe a button with three dots
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
on it that
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
indicates more and and so if you don't
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
see the
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
raise your hand at the bottom of the
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
screen of that column
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
check the the more button to see if
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
raised your hand is there
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
and if you're on the oh there's a hand
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and look at that it's representative
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
so i'm bringing her in i hope that was
 
01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:01.990 align:start position:0%

yoga backed by scientific research
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
especially with pain mental illness or
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
mental status done by
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
national institute of mental health and
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
neurosciences as well as harvard um
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
mind body institute has a lot of backing
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
and uh there is evidence based and
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
we have to start somewhere and
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
if this is not the place this was the
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
second time this was introduced
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
by me previous time it went to health
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
and human services with
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
alternative therapies and it was
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
i was told that it was i was trying to
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
boil the ocean with
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
every alternative therapeutic
 
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.950 align:start position:0%
every alternative therapeutic
intervention

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
so you know break it down
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
bring it one at a time or you know i
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
acupuncture as well as uh chiropractors
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
and uh natural apathy that was the last
 
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.630 align:start position:0%
and uh natural apathy that was the last
bill

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
and you know we went through that it
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
said no this is not
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
the way to do it okay in the insurance
 
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.630 align:start position:0%
the way to do it okay in the insurance
companies

01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh said we will you know we need
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of uh support from legislation
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
in order to see if this is doable pilot
 
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying whichever way and i know
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a modality that is helpful
 
01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.470 align:start position:0%
that this is a modality that is helpful
for

01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
many of my constituents and other than
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know across the ocean
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to make this of mainstream
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
so if this is not the recommendation
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
i respectfully take that and
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'll continue to work and make this
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
available because we are in a crisis
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
and before the pandemic hit we were in
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
crisis and we have 80 people waiting in
 
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:33.110 align:start position:0%
crisis and we have 80 people waiting in
the

01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
er and the families of
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
er boarding due to mental illness and
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
families dealing with that
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm dealing with phone calls almost on a
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
weekly basis
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
begging for some kind of a relief in the
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
anxiety level
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
so this is a simple tool that can bring
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
some kind of a relief at least a coping
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
strategy it's not a cure all and
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
end all and be all uh but
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
if that's not what we are going to look
 
01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.310 align:start position:0%
if that's not what we are going to look
at

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's fine and i will try my attempt
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking me to speak and
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you

for letting me be part of the fly to
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
you're muted representative williams
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
so would anyone else like to speak uh on
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1464
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
i see a hand from representative van
 
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
i see a hand from representative van
houghton

01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
houghton
 
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and um thank you for bringing
 
01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.189 align:start position:0%
thank you and um thank you for bringing
your

01:15:41.189 --> 01:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
your expertise to us representative
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
manjapuri uh
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
with due respect to what you're saying
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just double checking the bill
 
01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
this is specific to an alternative
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
substitute for opioids
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that we've been
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
presented with enough information to see
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
that that is an alternative therapy
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
i totally agree with you anxiety uh
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
headaches all sorts of things
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
may well may well be not cured but at
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
least addressed
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
um by by this kind of therapy and so i
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention that at this
 
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:11.910 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention that at this
point

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
and again um i know that you have great
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
insights into this and i do respect that
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was before the pandemic
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
i was trying to address just the pain
 
01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:37.830 align:start position:0%
i was trying to address just the pain
and

01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
anxiety due to pain and overdose because
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
that was the population that was looking
 
01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.550 align:start position:0%
that was the population that was looking
for

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
alternative to opioid during when they
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
get started on opioid
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
to have another way of dealing with it
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
and then gradually ease into it
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
that was the main reason why
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
i had introduced just for that and
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
due aft and this post pandemic
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic what has evolved is
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
the specifically for anxiety reduction
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
and stress reduction
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
during covet 19 and i can send you guys
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
the studies that has been done with
 
01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.390 align:start position:0%
the studies that has been done with
thousand

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
people participating over uh
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
three months with just yoga intervention
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
and but again
 
01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
i will bring forth a different bill
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
and um with
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
the framework of um
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
covert 19 in mental health and not
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
specifically focused on uh pain
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
and pain management because this was
 
01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.430 align:start position:0%
and pain management because this was
post

01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
post
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
ac bill would be different after covert
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative butler um i would like to
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead thank you um i would
 
01:18:11.110 --> 01:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh move that uh house bills 1464
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
not be recommended for future
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and if i could just
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh say that even though representative
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
herbert isn't here
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
his commentary and when in this
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
discussion was that uh
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
yoga has been beneficial for uh
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
people for 5000 years and we know that
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
but commerce is focused primarily on
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
how we deal with the insurance issues
 
01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.030 align:start position:0%
how we deal with the insurance issues
and

01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
there is a long way to go uh to get
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh yoga therapy which is obviously
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
beneficial and many of us agree
 
01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
to the point of being able to be
 
01:18:50.719 --> 01:18:51.669 align:start position:0%
to the point of being able to be
reimbursable

01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursable
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
that motion and
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
and i would i would recommend uh
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative that if you bring
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
something forward
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
next year that part of it needs to be to
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
create some sort of
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire-based uh licensing
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
or certification because i think to get
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to pay for services
 
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
either voluntarily or
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
or by statute um there has to be some
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
way for them to recognize that that
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
provider is in fact
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh providing a a useful service so i
 
01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.510 align:start position:0%
uh providing a a useful service so i
think

01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
that level of certification even though
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
i know that there's
 
01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
national or international certification
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
um i think there needs to be something
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's new hampshire based
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
in order to uh to move that forward so
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'd recommend
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you do something that that's part of
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i see no other hand so you can go
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
ahead with the
 
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:07.280 align:start position:0%

thank you okay so we'll move on to
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1697
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
which is relative to prescription drug
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
and is there anyone who would like to
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
butler has a hand up
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
there were a variety of bills to
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
work on reducing the cost of
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
copay coupons and
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
various coupon programs
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think are still problematic however
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1280 passed a variety
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
of efforts at um
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
decreasing the cost of prescription
 
01:22:33.679 --> 01:22:35.110 align:start position:0%
decreasing the cost of prescription
drugs

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that has gone through the entire
 
01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.390 align:start position:0%
and that has gone through the entire
process

01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
and uh the governor has signed it um i
 
01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:42.310 align:start position:0%
and uh the governor has signed it um i
think

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
we are at a point where we maybe need to
 
01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.229 align:start position:0%
we are at a point where we maybe need to
take

01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh a breath and see what the
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh pieces of 1280 do
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
epipen build the prescription
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
board affordability board
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
the cross-border
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
efforts and so
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
unless others make a better argument i
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
think at this point
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
it was a good idea but uh not something
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh representative
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
williams and
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
mr dave butler george george
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
um you know this bill this issue um i
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate you saying let's take a break
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that we really do need
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
to come back to so i'm going to accept
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
that maybe this first
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
section of our we um you know first
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
year of the session that we need to let
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
it go but the distortion
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
that these discounts do cause in the
 
01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.550 align:start position:0%
that these discounts do cause in the
market

01:24:06.550 --> 01:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
is something that has to be addressed
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
and i really feel like
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a good cause before it's
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
time before we really could educate
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
the people that are going to get hurt
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
initially by removing it
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
so i do appreciate your efforts in this
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
issues that i know a lot of us will
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
carry forward and
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
continue to look at and um thank you for
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
tying it in
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
and you know talking about the changes
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
in 1280 we'll watch that
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
but this your efforts in this area
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
they've educated me and a lot of people
 
01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.149 align:start position:0%
they've educated me and a lot of people
so

01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
um you know good work and let's continue
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
and representative abel yes thank you
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
um since there was
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
a committee a study committee set up
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
i want to ask a question of whether we
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
have any knowledge of whether that
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee is in fact
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
still studying these issues
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
because the report is supposed to be
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
coming this fall
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
and it seems like we shouldn't be
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
recommending or not recommending
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
when that study may come out differently
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
than what we would
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
what we would uh vote on i mean is there
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
a way to say
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
not give a recommendation if if not then
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
we need to do one or the other okay
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
it certainly doesn't prohibit anything
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
to come from a study committee
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
i think you're going to find that study
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
committees none of them have really been
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
meeting since march
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
anyone else so i i
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
recognize the absence of representative
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
muscatel who was a co-sponsor on this
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
bill and worked on it very hard and
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately the next time we hear
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
from him he'll probably be
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
a legislator in california and not back
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire but
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
maybe um but
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative fargo wrote the
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
blurb in our last iteration and i'm
 
01:26:20.239 --> 01:26:21.110 align:start position:0%
blurb in our last iteration and i'm
wondering

01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
if you would make a motion represent
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
fargo yeah
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
i'll make a motion to not recommend
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
moving forward on this and i
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
i do want to say though i remember a lot
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
of discussions on this
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
and how important it is for us to try to
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
to curb the costs um but my my big
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
concern at the time and still is the
 
01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:41.189 align:start position:0%
concern at the time and still is the
impact

01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
at um at the pharmacy for people right
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
now especially during the pandemic and
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
things like that it's just
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very difficult it's going to hurt
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of people so
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have we have to find a balance and i
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
i appreciate what you're saying about
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
seeing what the rest of this legislation
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
is going to provide
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
and um being more measured and i i do
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
think we need to go
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
there i just don't think this is the
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
right time so
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
with that said second
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the clerk will call the rule on not
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
recommended on house bill 1697 when she
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
vice chairman williams yes
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative gage not here
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%

01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
he's not muted and he's is his internet
 
01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.790 align:start position:0%
he's not muted and he's is his internet
stuff

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%

01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
he's muted well now he's unbeaten rich
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%

01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
um want me to give him a call
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
that would be good and if we could
 
01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:14.950 align:start position:0%
that would be good and if we could
continue

01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%

up or down it says
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative abel where we're we're
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's 15 yays no nays 15 to 0.
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll move on to the last item on
 
01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:08.470 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll move on to the last item on
today's

01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
today's
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
and that would be uh hp 1215
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the installation of solar
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
energy systems
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
in condominiums and homeowners
 
01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:25.110 align:start position:0%
in condominiums and homeowners
association

01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who would like to speak
 
01:30:27.199 --> 01:30:28.229 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who would like to speak
on

01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
this bill so
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
um i am i have been been the victim of
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
the uh homeowners uh
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
and condominium and homeowners uh
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh committee uh for a while now
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i i would say that
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
this is a very difficult thing to do
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
um to to be able to do something like
 
01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.070 align:start position:0%
um to to be able to do something like
this

01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
um the same issue that comes up in
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
almost every issue of condominium law is
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
who enforces it you know so somebody
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
wants to be able to put solar panels on
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
their roof
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh and the association doesn't let them
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know are they going to go to
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
superior court and spend several
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to be able to get
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
the permission to do that and then the
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
other issue
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
which we discussed at length in the in
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
hearing about this is what happens if
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
the roof is shared which is true in a
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh of condominiums or the the ground is
 
01:31:41.679 --> 01:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh of condominiums or the the ground is
shared

01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's common area and not belonging
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
to one particular
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh apartment or condominium
 
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
in those circumstances who's
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
who's allowed to put the solar panels on
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
what space
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
and what happens if the roof leaks
 
01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.110 align:start position:0%
and what happens if the roof leaks
because

01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
somebody misinstalled the solar panels i
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
think there's just a lot of
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
issues around
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
making a rule that allows someone to do
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh when other people disagree
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
um it's shared space and so you need to
 
01:32:19.199 --> 01:32:20.070 align:start position:0%
um it's shared space and so you need to
have

01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
agreement among the the residents in
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
order to do these kinds of things
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
and i see representative van houten's
 
01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:29.669 align:start position:0%
and i see representative van houten's
hand

01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you as a condominium owner and
 
01:32:32.639 --> 01:32:33.510 align:start position:0%
thank you as a condominium owner and
resident

01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
resident
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh there are several issues that really
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
come up here that the bill really
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
was the the beginning of something but
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
not the end of something is a great deal
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
to be looked at one of the major issues
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
i think is the
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh percentage i believe simple majority
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
for this and um i know that in my
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
association there are lots of issues
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
that are coming up with the covet issues
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
um the amenities here were not opened
 
01:32:58.159 --> 01:32:58.629 align:start position:0%
um the amenities here were not opened
and

01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
the there was a real hollow blue about
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know why can't we who can vote and
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
things of that sort
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
so i think the complexities of this bill
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
have been brought home to me even more
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
fully now that we're looking at those
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of things
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
also condominium law is still relatively
 
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.510 align:start position:0%
also condominium law is still relatively
new

01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
and i think this might be something that
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
should be referred back to
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's mentioned in the in the
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
blurb or in the um
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
um in in the uh written out written
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
aspect of this
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
committee to study the laws relating to
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
condominium condominium and homo
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
home owners associations excuse me for
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
stumbling through that
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
i i think there's a lot more work to be
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
done on this i absolutely applaud the
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
idea of solar energy and of
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
giving access to that but right now i'm
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
talking to you from the bottom
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
floor of an eight uh unit condominium
 
01:33:44.639 --> 01:33:45.430 align:start position:0%
floor of an eight uh unit condominium
building

01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if i wanted to have solar energy i
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how i would be able to access
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
that freestanding condo buildings
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
probably have a better opportunity to do
 
01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:53.910 align:start position:0%
probably have a better opportunity to do
that

01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless there are issues of
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
aesthetics for instance that people are
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
the long and short of it is um i think
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
the idea of solar energy
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
certainly is is is valid and worth
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
looking at but this bill before it's
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
ready to really go anywhere needs a
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
great deal of
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
fine-tuning and a great deal of
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
contemplation as to how the she
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
should be brought forward thank you
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett hi um
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to just reiterate
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
some of what um
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative manhattan said the thing
 
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
that concerns me is the simple majority
 
01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.750 align:start position:0%
that concerns me is the simple majority
vote

01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
um to get to 51 which changes the bylaws
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
just for this one issue um
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with i i do no it's not
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
letting me hear
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
anything i do recognize that
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
um two-thirds or
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
three-quarters majority vote is very
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to come to
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
on many condominium associations
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
particularly the larger ones
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with with um
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
there you know just going to a simple
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
majority just for this one issue
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
um even though i think that solar energy
 
01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.350 align:start position:0%
um even though i think that solar energy
certainly

01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
is important that we use alternative
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
energies i just don't think
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
i think this bill has so many problems
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i can't
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
i can't support it as far as
 
01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:20.470 align:start position:0%
i can't support it as far as
recommending

01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh future legislation
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.910 align:start position:0%
trying to bring him in if he had his
video

01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
video
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
oh okay sorry about that you you're
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
you're back now
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay um so uh i'm an attorney who
 
01:36:13.679 --> 01:36:14.550 align:start position:0%
okay um so uh i'm an attorney who
represents

01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
represents
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh associations uh in new hampshire
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
and um at the moment i am speaking on
 
01:36:21.679 --> 01:36:22.229 align:start position:0%
and um at the moment i am speaking on
behalf

01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the community association institute's
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
legislative action committee for the
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
my issue with this proposal is that
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
associations are condominiums are
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
creatures of statute they exist only
 
01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:41.669 align:start position:0%
creatures of statute they exist only
because

01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
governing documents are drafted that
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
create them and bring them into
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
existence and those documents are then
 
01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
existence and those documents are then
recorded

01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
as public records at the registry of
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
deeds so
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
everyone who purchases a unit at a
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
condominium association
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
does so not only on a voluntary basis
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
but they do so presumably with knowledge
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
of these condominium documents
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
and any restrictions that they contain
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason i've said this
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
before but i'll say again
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
whenever i see a proposal that would in
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
start out as this does with language
 
01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.149 align:start position:0%
start out as this does with language
notwithstanding

01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
any greater vote requirement in a
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
condominium instrument or bylaws
 
01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
i become frightened that we're probably
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
not doing a good thing
 
01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
because these documents exist they are
 
01:37:33.679 --> 01:37:33.990 align:start position:0%
because these documents exist they are
what

01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
creates the condominium in the first
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
place unit owners buy their condominium
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
and choose to live with these
 
01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.189 align:start position:0%
and choose to live with these
restrictions

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then to the extent that the law
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
would say well we're going to set those
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions aside
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
i think we're sort of setting the stage
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
for problems
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
um other than that i think i would just
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
reiterate some of the points that have
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
been made which is that in an
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
association unit owners typically do not
 
01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:00.310 align:start position:0%
association unit owners typically do not
own

01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
the outside of the building they don't
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
own the roof they don't own the grounds
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
and so a number of problems arise to the
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
extent that unit owners would be allowed
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
to circumvent
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
the association's normal voting
 
01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:14.950 align:start position:0%
the association's normal voting
standards

01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
and on this lesser basis of a simple
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
majority vote
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
start to try to claim the ability to put
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
things in those spaces
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
the leaky roof is an issue the notion of
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
what happens when we run
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
out of roof space and there are still
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
unit owners who want to
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
have solar or what happens if
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
unit owners disagree about solar that
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
gets placed on the ground
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
what happens when someone puts a solar
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
panel in place and then sells their unit
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
and moves away
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
these are all questions that to me
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
reflect the fact
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
that association living just really
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
isn't the right environment
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
to to undertake actions like this and so
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
um we're not against solar we recognize
 
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
the value of it
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
um but it seems that to the extent it's
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
a priority for an individual
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
um that individual probably needs to be
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
living in a different sort of
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
environment than an association
 
01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:16.790 align:start position:0%
environment than an association
environment

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
where the outside spaces are are all
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
shared and not under one's own
 
01:39:21.199 --> 01:39:25.270 align:start position:0%
shared and not under one's own
ownership

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
so pam could you uh promote uh mr lennon

sure

01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%

can you unmute yourself mr lennon there
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
you go
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for the
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
promotion there uh representative
 
01:39:58.880 --> 01:39:59.910 align:start position:0%
promotion there uh representative
williams

01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
williams
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to uh
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
speak i am also on the
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
cai uh new hampshire legislative action
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee with gary
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to uh reiterate what
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
everyone has said but i would certainly
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh support
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
the comments of representative van
 
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:15.430 align:start position:0%
the comments of representative van
houghton

01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
houghton
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh and and my major concern like gary
 
01:40:18.629 --> 01:40:18.639 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
the 51 vote changing uh what is in
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
almost every set of docks would be a
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
minimum of of 67
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
and at times 75 percent um
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
and and the issue that you know when
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about installation
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
typically on the roof
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's almost certainly common area unless
 
01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:36.229 align:start position:0%
it's almost certainly common area unless
it's

01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
standalone townhouses or single-family
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
homes within a condo
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
but you know let's say the installation
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
goes bad and there's uh a roof leak
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
who's paying for that
 
01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh what is the basis uh for uh assessing
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh the damages
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
what if the panels are installed and the
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
roofs need to be
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
replaced two years later that owner is
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to be fit to be tied when he asked
 
01:41:02.709 --> 01:41:02.719 align:start position:0%
to take his
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
panels off at his own expense and and
 
01:41:06.790 --> 01:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
put them back on so there's a whole host
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
of issues
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to community living uh
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
with solar panels i have solar panels
 
01:41:12.159 --> 01:41:12.629 align:start position:0%
with solar panels i have solar panels
myself

01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
they're fantastic they pay for
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
themselves but
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
those issues i don't live in a
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
condominium or a community association
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh so there's just a whole host of
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
issues that are at play there
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
um and then the issue of aesthetics too
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
some will have them some will not
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people move to community
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
associations because of
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh the uniform aesthetics but thank you
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
and representative mcbet
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative williams so um
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
i find this issue fascinating and i
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
think it is extremely important
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i related a little bit to the uh
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition that we've heard about
 
01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:55.830 align:start position:0%
prohibition that we've heard about
before

01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the ham radio antennas on the outside
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
of condominiums
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
and i really um i think that we don't
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
want to i don't want to admit that if
 
01:42:06.639 --> 01:42:07.830 align:start position:0%
want to i don't want to admit that if
you

01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
want a ham radio or if you want solar
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
panels on your
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
residence you can't be part of a
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
community living
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
situation so i do think there are issues
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
within this particular bill that
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know particularly the changing of
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
the percentage for voting and others
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
um that you know aren't i'm not
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable with but
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're not necessarily just
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill we're looking at
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
of um you know freely contracting
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know what you might like in your
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
collective so i i really i guess i'm
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
just saying i like the issue i support
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
moving forward with it it's not a ball
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna pick up
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
but um i just um i do see some value in
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
discussing it
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative butler
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just want to
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
encourage uh those people in
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh cai um and
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh folks who are advocates for
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh condominium living that there
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
have been issues uh in the past that
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
have come to the legislature
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
that have needed to have legislative
 
01:43:21.199 --> 01:43:22.870 align:start position:0%
that have needed to have legislative
involvement

01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
this may or may not be one but i
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't just assume
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
that uh uh because the associations
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh feel that it's uh a threat in some
 
01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.229 align:start position:0%
uh feel that it's uh a threat in some
ways

01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
that it isn't something that uh if
 
01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.669 align:start position:0%
that it isn't something that uh if
enough

01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
owners uh come to the legislature um
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
and raise the priority that it isn't
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
will continue to be discussed and
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh considered and
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
maybe someday uh uh voted upon
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
um this bill may not be it and i agree
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
um that it should not be recommended but
 
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:01.590 align:start position:0%
um that it should not be recommended but
um

01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:05.590 --> 01:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh i i bristle at the
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
idea that it's not something that the
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
legislature shouldn't
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't just that condominiums and
 
01:44:22.239 --> 01:44:22.709 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't just that condominiums and
other

01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations shouldn't
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
operate just on the basis of their
 
01:44:28.470 --> 01:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
founding documents because those
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
documents are often written
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the developer and
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
when the developer leaves and the
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
residents take over they're often not
 
01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:38.709 align:start position:0%
residents take over they're often not
rewritten

01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
rewritten
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
and so those documents aren't
 
01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.510 align:start position:0%
and so those documents aren't
necessarily

01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh optimized for clean
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
and and straightforward operation
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh which is why we have uh the
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
condominium law in our statutes because
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
issues over the years and some of that
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
some of that kind of medium law is
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
really about development but a lot of it
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
is about
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
operation so i i would agree that this
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
a bill to move forward but that having
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh the state provide some regulation for
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
condominiums and homeowners associations
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
and so i see uh mr daddario
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh has his hand up again
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay you can speak if there you go
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
hi thank you um i just wanted to quickly
 
01:45:36.239 --> 01:45:37.189 align:start position:0%
hi thank you um i just wanted to quickly
apologize

01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think it may have been some of my
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
statements that
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
um led to the perception that
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
there's a suggestion made that the
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislature not be involved with
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
condominiums and i apologize uh
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
if i was not clear i did not mean to be
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
stating something quite that bold
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
certainly the the legislature has been
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
involved the condominium
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
act exists other than an association's
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
individual documents
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's the primary source for us in
 
01:46:07.679 --> 01:46:08.629 align:start position:0%
it's the primary source for us in
explaining

01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
explaining
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
how condominiums need to operate and i'm
 
01:46:11.679 --> 01:46:12.070 align:start position:0%
how condominiums need to operate and i'm
sure

01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
that there will be legislative
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
involvement with condominiums
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
in the future as well we as a group in
 
01:46:19.510 --> 01:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
fact have sought
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature's assistance in trying
 
01:46:23.669 --> 01:46:23.679 align:start position:0%
to pass a bill that would allow
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
associations to foreclose
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
when they need to on unpaid assessments
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
that's not the topic for
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
for today but it's an example of us
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
understanding that the legislature
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely is
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
involved for the most part i would just
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
tend to shy away
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
from as is the case with this bill uh
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
legislative language that says
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the contrary language
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
and the documents
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
um so in other words i think that when
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
speaks on issues for condominiums and
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
put something into law
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
i think it would be great if it were an
 
01:46:57.679 --> 01:46:58.870 align:start position:0%
i think it would be great if it were an
addition

01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
addition
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
to what exists or an explanation um but
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it conflicts with
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
what associations are are otherwise
 
01:47:06.159 --> 01:47:06.790 align:start position:0%
what associations are are otherwise
doing

01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
then it might set the stage for for
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
problems and here
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's not even so much an issue of the
 
01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:14.629 align:start position:0%
it's not even so much an issue of the
actual

01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
subject matter solar it's this issue
 
01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.629 align:start position:0%
subject matter solar it's this issue
that

01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
they would change the voting
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
requirements that otherwise exist in the
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
community and
 
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
as has been said by others to the extent
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
that those voting
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
requirements serve just fine for every
 
01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
other issue
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
they should probably carry through but
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
in any event again i just wanted to
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
apologize for any confusion and note
 
01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:36.790 align:start position:0%
apologize for any confusion and note
that

01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:38.790 --> 01:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
we certainly do see the legislature as
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
being part of
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
condominium governance thank you mr
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
dario and
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank you for your
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%

frequent attendee and uh we uh we
