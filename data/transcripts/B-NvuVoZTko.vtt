proposed rule changes uh prior to uh
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
these changes being considered by JL car
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah uh what we have before us
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
today are the minimum academic standards
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
for public school approval and you know
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee for
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
improvement and
 
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%
assessment has responsibility for
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
reviewing the academic
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
standards we have we passed legislation
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
out of this committee earlier this year
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
where we were looking to also have
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority through that
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee which would be the oversight
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
committee to also review the minimum
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval now
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
in accordance with
 
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.949 align:start position:0%
in accordance with
193e

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
193e
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
2A um we have a section there which
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
deals with curriculum where the general
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
court every 10 years must look at what
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
we're doing in terms of those criteria
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
substantive criteria for an adequate
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
education which are in in the rules in
 
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:02.519 align:start position:0%
the sections we're going to be looking
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
at today this is why we're we're looking
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
at this today simply because this is not
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
a statutory or standing committee that's
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
been you know in the the uh you'll see
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
on the web this is a a committee that's
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
been put together by leadership to
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that we can give some support to
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
Jael car when they review the rules
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
after they've been you know heard by the
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
state board and they come to jel car for
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
their look and jel car has not had I
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
would say not the expertise but they
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
haven't had the time really to deal with
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
the wide variety of departments and
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
bureaus where these rules come from
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
everything from Health and Human
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
Services to criminal justice to the
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
whole Transportation the whole nine
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
yards and so they've asked now that
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
these subcommittees which are within the
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
policy areas look at potential rules
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
which are being looked at by the state
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
board and which will come to jelar and
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
give our thoughts in terms do the
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
proposed changes mesh with statutory law
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
and policy that we are familiar with so
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
that is our task
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
today and I know that there's going to
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
be issues today when we're dealing with
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the word competency
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
throughout this section we also have
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
competencies defined in the section that
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be dealing with today
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
the first part when you see the
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
definitions of that and that's been one
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the big big concerns dealing with the
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
one of them with the
 
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
306s we will be as a education committee
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
having a another meeting yet to be
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
scheduled where we will be looking at
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
the entire gamut of
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
306 before those rules go to gelar and
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
they have you know just this what past
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
week were presented to the state
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
board so now that that's occurred we
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
will have folks that were involved in
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
the writing of them in fact I even spoke
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
with one person yesterday that
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
represents the business industry
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
associating at the at the uh advisory
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
coun for Career Technical education was
 
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:18.519 align:start position:0%
explaining some of the things which went
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
on with
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
306 so what I'd like to do right now
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
does that explain where I I I I think
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
that that does a lot of it Mr chair um
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
the the one other the the one other
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
thing i' i' I'd ask that you um you
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned though and you you just sort
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
of um touched on it is uh the action
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
that the State Board um may have taken
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
last week with respect to the proposed
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
rules uh I don't know if that
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
constituted um uh the State Board
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
approving the academic the changes to
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
the academic
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
standard I I wasn't there I didn't
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
participate in that that was a that was
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
a hearing I don't think there now I'm
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
just surmising I don't believe that they
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
actually made a approved those a vote
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
okay there was no vote taken okay um and
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
these this portion of the package comes
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
up and yes you'll note on the to the uh
 
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.189 align:start position:0%
up and yes you'll note on the to the uh
second

00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
page well the second piece of paper it's
 
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
actually page three where you see the
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
information that's provided by the
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
administrative rules coordin
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
the deadline for submission of materials
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
and writing if practicable for the
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
agency in the electronic format would be
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
April 30th public hearing is scheduled
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
for April 11 2024 at 1:00 over at
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
Granite State College V Event Center so
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
we're actually looking at this component
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
right here prior to that and if we have
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations I will certainly share
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
those recommendations with the
 
00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:58.520 align:start position:0%
department and also with Jael card okay
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
and then and then finally on on you know
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
as we're sort of laying out a a a
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
timeline of of um of U for lack of a a
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
better word of uh state or bureaucratic
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
administrative actions towards towards
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
these rules uh 193
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
e2a Roman 4 C says the State Board shall
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
not amend any existing academic
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
standards so now we're talking academic
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
standards and shall not approve any new
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
AC mic standards without the prior
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
review and recommendation of the
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
established in 193 C8 uh C call 8A which
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
is the oversight committee you were just
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
referencing that you chair that's been
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
the issue that we have had we're
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
contesting that we have that authority
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
to review these in accordance this
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
component right here in accordance with
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
1932a and the Roman numeral you're
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
speaking to there right prior to state
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
board action on that's what we're doing
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
right now through this well that that's
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
not what we're doing cuz we're not this
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
isn't the this isn't the the 198
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
CA committee that's right this is this
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
is another committee so we're going to
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
take it step by step it's the same
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
people but or many of the same people
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
the the the C the the ca committee also
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
includes uh members of the Senate right
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but do you notice the date on
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
this April that's when they're hearing
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
it that's not where they're taking
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
action right but and so that's later on
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
you know where they have the electronics
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
can be you know information can be
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
submitted up to April 30th sure so then
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
they have to schedule this now they're
 
00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
on a time frame similar for this portion
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
as they are for all 306 but but just and
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
it's going to go through to almost like
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
July okay just my my point is is that
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
C legislative oversight committee will
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
will have to vote and make a
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation prior to state board
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
acting on um on these standards when we
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
when we put that in the calendar we're
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to be going with the full
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
package of 306 at the same time that's
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
when we will also you know be making
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations to that oversight
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
committee where then that committee will
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
meet and go forward okay thank you
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so let's start right at the
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
top of this with the first uh uh bullet
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
there with the
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
30631 regarding the Arts education is
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
being re reopt with the amendment and
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
replaces the word program with
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum and amends the language so
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
the school board is providing a
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum that is consistent with the
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
comp with competencies in earlier
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
sections of Ed
 
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
306 a lot of this language is going to
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
be repetitive as we go
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
through so looking at that you also have
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
a copy of the rules and I've been
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
informed that the the rules which we're
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
addressing are not those which were
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
proposed yesterday or the last week in
 
00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:15.799 align:start position:0%
this section area they're not supposedly
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
section so so so so Mr chair you're
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're right going through these
 
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.830 align:start position:0%
you're you're right going through these
first

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
um the first page there's a lot program
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
replaced in second page a lot of program
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
replaced with curriculum um I
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
guess what does that why why did they do
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
that and what does it mean I don't work
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
for the state board well is there well
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
is there somebody um from the Department
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
that could address that I I if you look
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
at the website for the Department I'm
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
going to try to bring that up right the
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
State Board of
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
Education you can also see when this is
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
posted here there also reference say the
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
introduced I don't know what that means
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
okay the rules as introduced the initial
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
proposal okay right here okay the one
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
that I I provided you yeah yeah we've
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
got that yeah febru the February 15 24
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
right um so that's what we've got to but
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
I it would still be good to know what
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
what you know if the if the moving Parts
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
here are essentially
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh program being replaced with
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum you know why did they do it
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
mean I mean if it's a if it's a if it's
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
a change that doesn't make a change then
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
why do they make the
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
change I think that there must be some
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
sort of um intent and meaning for the
 
00:22:57.679 --> 00:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
sort of um intent and meaning for the
change

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
that could be a question we put down as
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
changing the the issue dealing with
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
program and curriculum replacing program
 
00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.310 align:start position:0%
program and curriculum replacing program
with

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum does that is that contrary to
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
anything we have in
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
statute that's a good good question
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's the question that we have to ask
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
mhm because if it doesn't conflict with
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
statute then a recommendation would be
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
the Jael card we don't have a problem
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
right right so so so we we need to be
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
also referencing our our our statutes
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
and so it's the outcome of this meeting
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
going to be since there's nobody from
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.590 align:start position:0%
the Department
here

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
right so right so is the is the outcome
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
of this meeting going to be
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
that they are here there's a slug of
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
them downstairs right now testifying on
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
to the Senate Ed okay but they're not
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
here in this meeting so yeah um uh uh so
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
is the is the outcome going to be
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
questions that we put into a memo that
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
goes to the department that our ad hoc
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
rules committee is going to one of the
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
questions I do have Dave is represent
 
00:24:25.149 --> 00:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
luno that's okay is that we reference
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
the word competencies throughout these
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
changes here but but the definition of
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
competencies early in 306 is not in
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
accordance with
 
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.870 align:start position:0%
accordance with
statute

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
okay and if you look at the statutory
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
definition and then you look at the
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
definition that's going to be in Ed 306
 
00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.470 align:start position:0%
definition that's going to be in Ed 306
they're

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
different and that's something that as a
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee working for Jael card right
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
now or submitting to Jael car we should
 
00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:51.149 align:start position:0%
now or submitting to Jael car we should
note

00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
that there should be a statutory
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
reference for everything we're
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
doing so so are Mr chair are we going to
 
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
prepare a report following this meeting
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
that will go to doe for answers and also
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
go to JL
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
car the the way that our task has been
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
we we are responsible for submitting
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
directly to Jael car to the chair of
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
that committee with concerns which we
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
have I I I'm assuming they could be cced
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
also to the Department
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
for them to you know if we we have those
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
concerns yes how's that report going to
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
be prepared oh it have to come out of
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
here I'd have to write it with all the
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
changes which we're going to note today
 
00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:42.510 align:start position:0%
changes which we're going to note today
okay

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's start working on it
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay I want to open up my computer
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
so I can reference the where we are in
 
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.230 align:start position:0%
so I can reference the where we are in
terms

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:07.549 align:start position:0%
 
of

00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair yeah this short two-page
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
thing is a summary of this bigger thing
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
that we yes supposed to explain what's
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
being done on each area thank you so we
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
want to look at first at that first area
 
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.750 align:start position:0%
want to look at first at that first area
there

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
83631 and then looking at what we have
 
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:37.430 align:start position:0%
83631 and then looking at what we have
here

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question what's the
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
program so I think that's a that's a a
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
question also when you look looking at
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole sentence the local
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
school board shall used to be require
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
that an
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
arts program an Arts educ ation program
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
for grades 1 through
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
12 um
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
provides and so now
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
removed the local school board shall
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum and the and the summary
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
says may be included so it may be incl
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
included but it doesn't have to be
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
included so they can just leave it out
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
if they want to yeah and does does
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum include instruction because
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
program sounds like it would include
 
00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:38.919 align:start position:0%
instruction they're separate all right
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
so so maybe one definition here is that
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
program is curriculum plus
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
instruction and that's being so the
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
instruction part is being is being um
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
jettisoned as you recall when we we
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
passed legislation early this year with
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
the curriculum
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks the curriculum Frameworks
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
serve as a
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
guide we also Incorporated in the
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
language of that bill that curriculum
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
Frameworks also reflect the academic
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
standards right but the Frameworks are
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
something that comes from the Department
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
of Education from the state board to
 
00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
from the state board to assist school
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
districts in in in developing their
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
their curriculum the locals are
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for curriculum uh and
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
instruction so the state board's not
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
responsible for instruction but these
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
are the minimum uh standards for for
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
public school approval and and schools
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
provide both curriculum and instruction
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it seems like the approval standards
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
now are eliminating the instruction part
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
and just going with the curriculum part
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
and that that leaves um I I don't know
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
where the I don't know how the
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
instruction happens and I don't know how
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
the where the learning happens if um if
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
all you're leaving the schools with is
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
the set of encyclop this is part of the
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
conflict which we have and we've dealt
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
with this over the
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
years yes these local school districts
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
have Authority for
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
instruction the scope and the sequence
 
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
of when they teach these skills
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell School might want
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
to teach something in the ninth grade
 
00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
represent lunos might do it in the 10th
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
grade that's part of the sequence of how
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
but then when we align those with an
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
assessment tool the assessment tool is
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
identified in conjunction of being
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
teachers have to review it um that's
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
within the law as well a number of folks
 
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
have to review it but that's given at a
 
00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.519 align:start position:0%
certain grade level for all schools so
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
that's been the conflict I've always had
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
is that that's that Statewide assessment
 
00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
may not always be assessing what has
 
00:29:58.519 --> 00:29:59.310 align:start position:0%
may not always be assessing what has
been

00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
taught at a particular grade level and
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
maybe the following year the next year
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
that the kids so the kids are now
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
proficient in grade 10 rather than
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
taking something in the previous grade
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
level or any grade I just pick a grade
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
grade 11 but but Mr chair I mean I think
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
you're introducing Statewide assessment
 
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
at so let see so instruction though is
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
separate from curriculum no I understand
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
that but but going back to the word
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
that's been removed from This Is The
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
Word program and and just a few moments
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
ago I was sort of you know um
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
considering that well program is
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum plus instruction but you just
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
introduced another important term
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
assessment so program is program
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum plus instruction plus
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
assessment that would sort of compromise
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
a that that would comprise a
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
program and so are we are we now leaving
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
instruction and assessment out of the
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
approval just it's a question
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and I know we're using 30631 but I
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
it I think it almost applies to
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
everything that's on the summary sheet
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
here oh exactly exactly this is this is
 
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.909 align:start position:0%
here oh exactly exactly this is this is
the

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:26.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.919 --> 00:31:30.430 align:start position:0%
 
issue

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
and curriculum has always been a local
 
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.029 align:start position:0%
and curriculum has always been a local
control

00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
issue you establish whether you're going
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
to if you're looking at a textbook
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
whether you're going to use H hotton
 
00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
Mifflin or silver bdad or some other
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that most of them mcra
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
Hill that's your business as a school
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
district the academic standards are what
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
you have to teach that is what has to
 
00:31:53.399 --> 00:31:55.350 align:start position:0%
you have to teach that is what has to
remain

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
constant I I I get that
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
but what what's being what's
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
being proposed here as a change is
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
replacing the word I mean in addition to
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
other things is replacing the word
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
program with the word curriculum so so
 
00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:18.519 align:start position:0%
if if and I don't know if this is true
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
um if if program is curriculum plus
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
instruction plus
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
assessment pass out to you the final
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
proposed draft
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
of the whole nine yards and we can look
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
at the definitions here yeah and see
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
that's so where do we find the def well
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
it be right on the first or second page
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
curriculums at the
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
base and see they referencing curriculum
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
meaning as defined in 193 e2a Romans
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
6 item C I have more copies of those if
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
folks would like to have those the
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
e2a 6C I'm right here on
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
it curriculum means the lessons in
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
academic content taught in school or in
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
a specific course or program so
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
program curriculum means the lessons in
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
academic content taught so taught is
 
00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:26.470 align:start position:0%
academic content taught so taught is
instruction

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
right in school or in a specific course
 
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.310 align:start position:0%
right in school or in a specific course
of

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
program so that would sort of be
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with how we parsed out what
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
um what program means that program
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
includes curriculum
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
plus instruction instruction right and
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
if you look at assessment too right if
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
you if you look at uh 30614 the current
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
um rules which is uh basic instru Inu
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
standards the local school board shall
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
require that each school has an
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
instructional program which includes
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
policies on homework promoting students
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
Etc it doesn't get into content yeah
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
curriculum where in 30614 were you
 
00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.510 align:start position:0%
curriculum where in 30614 were you
looking

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
um X out stuff the line no um I'm sorry
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
it's uh I'm looking at the current one I
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
don't know you're looking looking what
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
just handed out yeah yeah where which
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
page are you on
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
Glenn on the current of the current yeah
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
um on on the or final proposal on page
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
nine that's what I'm looking
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
yeah you go
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
back yeah basically it's what's crossed
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
out on page nine of the final proposal
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
draft uh 30614 based constructional
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
standards um local schoolb should
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
require that each school has an
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
instructional program which
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
includes um the various policies listed
 
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
includes um the various policies listed
under

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
that L alphabet soup here the
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
instructional standards that we tried to
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate all the references to stand
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
standards to academic
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
standards we have instruction
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
period and you look at the definition of
 
00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
instruction which is on the front page
 
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
or in the second
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
page means deliberate and strategic
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
learning so
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
so M Mr chair I'm not a you know I've
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
never been a teacher um but instruction
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't stand on its own curriculum I
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
mean in let me say it another way
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
um it it seems to me that that that a
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
program would you know a program
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
in calculus let's say would include a
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum would include instruction and
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
it would include assessment
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
correct and and you know you could
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
almost replace the the word program with
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
course or class well for example like
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
CTE a
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
program as a program of studies leading
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
to that certification in the skill area
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
that we want as the outcome is so you
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
may have three or four or five different
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
courses that are part of that
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
woodworking program
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
yeah if if you look at I'm looking at
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal page four for CT
 
00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:59.750 align:start position:0%
the initial proposal page four for CT
e

00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
e
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
um in B1 this is Page four um based
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
on program is crossed out and has
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
changed to curriculum specific
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
competencies which all fall under the
 
00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
CTE program where you looking page four
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
page four of the initial proposal not
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
the not the Revis not the Rev okay we're
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
all going the wrong way here
 
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
all right the initial proposal from
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
February 15 so now this is very
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
interesting now this is really really
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
showing where the word program is
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
getting replaced with the word
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum right because curriculum and
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
competencies go hand inand right no C
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum is curriculum competency
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
competency is assessment is part of
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
assessment okay compeny is a where you
 
00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:55.750 align:start position:0%
assessment okay compeny is a where you
have

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
the that bar
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
to ascertain whether student has met the
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
academic standards that's assessment
 
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
right so then under B there it says An
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
approved CT program shall be one that
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
and number
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
one um it replaces makes it based on
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum competencies okay there's
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
competencies there's program and then
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
down in um four implements third party
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
assessments Okay so all right so you've
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
got under program you've got curriculum
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
competencies and
 
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
competencies and
assessments

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
um right to say we're all talking about
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
programs implication of cric instruction
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
assessment and competencies but program
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
if we're using the final draft is is the
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
is the bible program is not Define is
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's the definition we're making I'm on
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
page two Rick the final this not
 
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
there we're we're guessing what they
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
mean by program but we don't have to
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
guess what what's what's being changed
 
00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.670 align:start position:0%
guess what what's what's being changed
here

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
um curriculum specific
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
competencies could be um um you know
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
pick the pick the the this in in this
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
particular section the the CTE class so
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
so whether it's um a um a culinary arts
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh class being able to demonstrate that
 
00:39:31.079 --> 00:39:32.069 align:start position:0%
uh class being able to demonstrate that
that

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
you've you know how to perform something
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
um in a to meet a competency um in in uh
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
in that in that curricular area so in
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
that case we're not you're not even
 
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
talking about curriculum you're not
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
talking about instruction you're only
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
talking about assessment uh in that in
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
in item one B1 under
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
30633 based on curricular specific
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
says where are you
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
allly where on page one under 30602 on
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
definition and the
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
compy that just saying we be able to
 
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.150 align:start position:0%
compy that just saying we be able to
apply

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.990 align:start position:0%
apply
that's

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
yeah applying is a form of assessment
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's what this is saying poliy
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
according to this new definition policy
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
isine a specific set
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
of that's a performance assessment right
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
so that's an authentic performance
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
assessment that's that is so so to to
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
your to your point represent m
 
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum is there's the curriculum
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay it's just it's it's just a bunch of
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
bunch it's a
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
thing um instruction is now we're going
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
to what do you think we're going to read
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
through this we're going to talk about
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
it we're going to learn about it we're
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
going to really understand it that's the
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
instruction part right so so it's not
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
just here you go here you go there's the
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum and then the and then the
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
assessment is is the okay how well do
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
these students
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
understand the curriculum and how can
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
thatu could could I ask Mr chair
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner join
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
us well she I mean she's not on the
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
committee she's not on it she can sit at
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
the table this is a discussion so but
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
but you know the there's three
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
components that we got to have
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
align curriculum instruction and
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
assessment totally agree and that's been
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
years and have someone from the
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
Department who wrote who did this she's
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
really not she's not no there's nobody
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
else there's no one from instruction
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
down there no no but could Linda could
 
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.790 align:start position:0%
down there no no but could Linda could
represent

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
Tanner chair but she's not going to be
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
part of the sub like you
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
know Steve's not a member of the he's
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
sitting here with us and so she could
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
they could sit right here if they want
 
00:42:45.549 --> 00:42:45.559 align:start position:0%
to fact that's been offered to him yeah
 
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think maybe program isn't
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
defined because they've taken it out and
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
they're not using it so there is no
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
definition of program because in the new
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
rules they're not using program so they
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
gone where's the definition of
 
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.990 align:start position:0%
gone where's the definition of
curriculum

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
book what a student should be able to
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
know and do and it is an
 
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.090 align:start position:0%
know and do and it is an
assessment

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:40.100 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.270 align:start position:0%
assessment
[Music]

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
E28 that's how
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
compen it
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
ISS so that all you have to do is if you
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
can if you can tie a knot then it says
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
that you've had instruction in you know
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
different kinds
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
of we we really don't have standards for
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
instruction that's a local
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
issue as you we we have curriculum
 
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:13.240 align:start position:0%
defined here we have
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
um academics defined in your law books
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
560 but instruction is something you can
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
go to a classroom you see different
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
forms of instruction just about any
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
class you go into I I I I understand
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
that but but I guess by removing
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
instruction from this does that mean
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
that that public schools don't have to
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
provide instruction is instruction being
 
00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
removed well the word program is being
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
replaced by curriculum and and again I'm
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
going back to my theory here that
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
program is it as it's used in a must
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
provide a program um
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
that that that it's a combination of
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's curriculum plus instruction plus
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
assessment and if we're replacing
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
program with then curriculum with with
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
the word curriculum then we're leaving
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
out instruction and assessment
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
instruction is on the next page but it's
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
it's on the second page sorry you have
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
instruction instructional time that's
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
time on task stuff that we've all as
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
teachers been familiar with you know
 
00:45:31.549 --> 00:45:31.559 align:start position:0%
engage time vers seat time instruction
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
means deliberate and strategic
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
approaches it
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:45.559 align:start position:0%
this active prac teach that's what's
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
crossed out
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
this this just says facilitate student
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
learning so you could say go read pages
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
10 through 12 15 and you're facilitating
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
their learning because you're telling
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
them what to do but you're not teaching
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
them anything yeah so it's not teach so
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
teaching but you're facilitating student
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
learning isn't that teaching no it's
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's of teaching it's
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
not you can lead a horse to water but
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
you can't make him drink kind of thing
 
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
you know but some people can get them to
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
teaching yeah so te so would you say
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
that teaching includes content expertise
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
pedagogy and
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
facilitating and and maybe other things
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
too I don't and instru and instructing
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
yeah teaching and yeah that's why it was
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
yeah just
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
mention we do mention pedagogy in
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
Statute in
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
places but we don't Define it I I'm I'm
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
honestly Mr chair I'm blown Away by the
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
the degree of change being proposed here
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
that that this isn't just sort of um
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
administrative cleanup or or um
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
housekeeping clarifying rules this is a
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
absolute turn um Public Schools turn
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
teaching upside down and I I I don't
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
agree with you totally on that we've had
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
competencies built into our
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
instructional processes for years yeah
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm not I'm not criticizing that
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at a competency based
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
educational program so in as I was
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
trying to explain to Dave in a comp at
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
least when I was doing it the Competency
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
Based consisted of
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
rubrics consisted of rubrics that that
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
the teacher developed from the
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum and also from assessment that
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
were no no no no it it didn't come come
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
from curriculum curriculum is what you
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
use to for your instruction it's that
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's like he just explained curriculum
 
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
is that book right there but we designed
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
standards in which we're going to
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
purchase that book if that book doesn't
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
mesh up with our standards not going to
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
you're not going to buy it you're going
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
to get a curriculum that does reflect
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
your standards and your standards are
 
00:48:26.109 --> 00:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
then are what we base competencies off
 
00:48:26.119 --> 00:48:27.309 align:start position:0%
then are what we base competencies off
of

00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
and what I'm saying is in the CL in the
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
classroom though what happens is the
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
teacher builds rubrics which are
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
specific knowledge points and skill
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
points skill sets that lead the student
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
to an overall competency and then the
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
competency is bringing all those
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
knowledges and skills together in a
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
project that demonstrates or some sort
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
of essay or something that demonstrates
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
that they can use the knowledge the
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
specific knowledges and skills Within
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
that curriculum um and so to to not have
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
any of
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
that notice I guess is saying that okay
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
if a if a student says they can read a
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
ruler and they
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
can then they can do fractions you know
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
um and they haven't had any instruction
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
competency go back to the rsas
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
right under um
 
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
right under um
193

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
193
 
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
e2a it it says Roman 5A the curriculum
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
shall present educational goals broad
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
pedological approaches and strategies
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
for assistant St assisting students in
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
the development of skills competencies
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
and knowledge called for by the minimum
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
standards um it then goes on to Define
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
academic standards mean what a student
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
should know and be able to do in a
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
course at each grade level M then
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
curriculum means lessons and academic
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
content taught in a school or in a
 
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.030 align:start position:0%
content taught in a school or in a
specific

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
course um and the final draft and their
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
definition of curriculum points directly
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
rsas and just like is indicated in here
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
competencies mean a grouping of related
 
00:50:24.119 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
competencies mean a grouping of related
academic

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
academic
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
standards a student should be able to
 
00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
apply apply there's that word as a
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities I think that paragraph's
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
probably the Crux of all this stuff
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
right here right right I I I I think
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's important but but um but just
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
sort of stepping back aren't the
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
individual comp aren't the components
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
assessment I mean I'm not I'm not a
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
teacher so I don't I I know there's
 
00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:07.349 align:start position:0%
teacher so I don't I I know there's
subcomponents

00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
subcomponents
 
00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:11.799 align:start position:0%
and things and skills and uh but but at
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
at its at its most fundamental layer
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
you've got three things you've got the
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum you've got
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
instruction and then you've got
 
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
assessing the what the kids have what
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
yeah are they are they comp have they
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
mastered their
 
00:51:32.829 --> 00:51:32.839 align:start position:0%
competencies and and I know there's you
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
know from my time on the board you've
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
got the the you know formative and
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
summative assessments but I think that's
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
more that's more practicum than it is
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
than it is um the the the sort of the
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
fundamental the fundamental thing in in
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
assessment and at at the local level and
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
standards at the state level absolutely
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
and and and again I'm getting back to if
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
if what they what the current rules
 
00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
means in using the word program are
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
those the combination of those three
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
things curriculum instruction assessment
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
replacing the word program with just one
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
of those terms leaves the other two out
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
and and I'm wondering is that the intent
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
of um of these rule changes that that
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
the state is now
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh shifting its focus away from
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
education to just um
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
content curriculum I don't get that
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
well because they're replacing the word
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
program with
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum but if we go back to the
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
initial proposal the first one we're
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
were looking at
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
30631 everything that's described there
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
is more curriculum
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
rather than a program the you know you
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
could say that there should be a program
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
on Arts education but here the rules are
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
really defining What's
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
um components that should be in um the
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
Arts education for instance um we've
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
talked about Arts really includes dance
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
music theater
 
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
Etc and that's spelled out here so
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
that's part of the curriculum but it
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
still says which may include right it so
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
it may not include so all these things
 
00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
that yes they are
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
important but they may be included and
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
they cross out provides and and write in
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
include right at the top yep so when you
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
when you use may include um is is that
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
essentially saying you can these are
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
just examples but you don't have to do
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
any of this and it's not really even a
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
rule if it's a May right when you change
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
provide or is this being considered
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
I was just looking for the word program
 
00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.309 align:start position:0%
I was just looking for the word program
in

00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
often well I I
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
I I haven't been able to find the
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
definition of program either and it but
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
it's currently used in statute so I
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
would I would I would put it out there
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
what is the intent of you the use of the
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
word program
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
and um I I
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
I I think it's got a meaning that
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
includes I think it's got a more
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive meaning I think it's more
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum I think it includes
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
instruction and
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
assessment well according there there
 
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
what they have here in in that paragraph
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.910 align:start position:0%
that in
1932a

00:55:56.910 --> 00:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
1932a
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
five is saying that curriculum includes
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
pedagogy where where what P what page
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
are you on
 
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
560 curriculum shall present let's see
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
jump here curriculum shall present
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
education goals broad pedagogical
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
approaches now years ago I'll date
 
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
myself there was concern that schools
 
00:56:28.029 --> 00:56:28.039 align:start position:0%
weren't teaching science
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
properly so they came up with programs
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
like ESS which were inquiry oriented
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
science you get a box of
 
00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:39.799 align:start position:0%
materials and then the students were
 
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
able to inquire and build and project
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
and apply so that was also the
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum another one was
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
skiss and so at that point in time the
 
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.549 align:start position:0%
skiss and so at that point in time the
program

00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:53.559 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
included these components and and the
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
assessment component was being able to
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
do m not not a test it was being able to
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
do perform yeah yeah and that's dating
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
right back to the
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
1970s that's an elementary school right
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
ESS gu programs inquiry or science and
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
put out by the National Science
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
Foundation and and Department of
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
Education was really pushing it too when
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
it became a department in a federal
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
level so at that point in time the
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
program included all that MH right
 
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's what that's sort of what I've
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
been saying and so I'm not understanding
 
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
why we're taking a terminology out of
 
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
just and then writing a definition for
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
program which shall include or be part
 
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
you know your program is going to have
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
to have all those three basic
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
components to ensure it's being taught
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah leave program in and provide a
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
definition for program
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and some many explain that one to
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
me why it's not there yeah all right so
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
I I think that might sort of sum up what
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deal with here today
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
because we can go around and around and
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
this it's like education noted for the
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
alphabet soup and and and I I agree with
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I think Roman 5 on page 560
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
has a lot of the alphabet soup in
 
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.039 align:start position:0%
there where it talks about curriculum
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
including pedagogy I mean is that
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it talks about goals the whole
 
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:33.069 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it talks about goals the whole
nine

00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
knowledge Mr chair I know I'm not on the
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee but I'm getting I just I'm
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
listening to the luno uh description of
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
program being CIA when you look at um on
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
on five three on 160 when it talks about
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum it says or specific course or
 
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
program those are two separate things
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
I'm on the bottom page of 560 the RSA
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
193 932a it's on the five that Dave was
 
00:59:10.589 --> 00:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
just talking about when they Define
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum lessons and academic content
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
taught in a school or in a specific
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
course or program so that's not the
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
program is not the same as the one we
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
were just using as the CIA as the
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
oversight of Education critical
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
instruction assess
 
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
that's the three different things you
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
program and I know I'm not on the
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee I'm just saying that that last
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
sentence in Roman five on that same
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
page I think tries to addresses what I
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
was trying to say at the very beginning
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's up to the Local District the local
 
00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
teachers the local school board the
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
local administrators decide what our
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
instructions going to look
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
like what the scope in sequence of
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
presentation of the
 
01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum is going to look like and it
 
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:03.559 align:start position:0%
says it all right here it says it is
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
respons local teachers administrators
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
and school boards to identify and
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
Implement approaches best suited for
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
students in their communities to acquire
 
01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
the skills and knowledge included in the
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum to determine the scope
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
organization and sequence of course
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
offerings and to choose the methods of
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
instruction that the activities and the
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
materials to be
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
used that that's an excellent part of
 
01:00:28.589 --> 01:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
that that's a good part of that
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph I think the proceeding
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
language in that paragraph is a little
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
bit you know well it's just a
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
conglomeration of everything but down
 
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
here it says specifically and if you go
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
back to the beginning of 193 e it says
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
it's a shared responsibility however
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility now through rule making
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
are we now starting to shift curriculum
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.109 --> 01:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
state by putting it in
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
question because we've always had
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
curricular Frameworks which are
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines right we've never said this
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
is your curriculum we don't have a state
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum here we're not New York
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
State we li allow flexibility you pick
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
the curriculum to teach the required
 
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:40.870 align:start position:0%
the curriculum to teach the required
academic

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
standards and see the competencies is
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
that assessment and the question we've
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
been raising as a policy committee I
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
have been for years is that how do we
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
know that our Statewide assessment is
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
actually assessing properly what we
 
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.829 align:start position:0%
actually assessing properly what we
teach

01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
teach
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
in reading and language arts probably
 
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
so but maybe not in other areas that's
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
why we don't have a state assessment in
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
so social
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
studies and science we have yes we have
 
01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:17.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
stuff so what is it that we need to find
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
out here Mr
 
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
chair well I think we because as I when
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
we start out here there's some things
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
that are going to reference back into
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
the rules as being
 
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.829 align:start position:0%
the rules as being
proposed

01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
competencies and curriculum and taking
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
out program which are now impacting the
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
area that we're responsible for
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
here so we can say this looks good but
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
upfront so I guess that is the concern I
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
have is that why why the need to change
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum versus
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
teacher in definition of instruction but
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
that see that's not our charge here but
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
it will be down the way here I don't
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
like it when they change provides to may
 
01:03:21.549 --> 01:03:21.559 align:start position:0%
include or sh to May CU where are you
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
right now well um right at the first
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph of page one of on the initial
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
proposal the initial
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
proposal okay where it changes
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum from program and then which
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
provides and I and I think well this is
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
a new one but reading the old one there
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:01.589 align:start position:0%
 
maze

01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
but if we're making the change to per to
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum right that goes back to
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
also yeah yeah but I mean so local
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility is a
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility issue um minimum
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
standards is a here's what what what
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
each local school board is responsible
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
to at least do it sets a it sets a a
 
01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
hard deck as to um uh What uh what what
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
every school board is responsible
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
for and when we when we change that from
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
a from a required um you know
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
shall require
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
that an Arts education program so I'm
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
reading from the you know the crossed
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
out stuff um in grades 1 through
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
12 provides and it lists all those
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
things so now it's saying that
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
um that it no longer has to include
 
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
um that it no longer has to include
these

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
things well it says may include right
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
for example like technology in the art
 
01:05:19.359 --> 01:05:20.309 align:start position:0%
for example like technology in the art
art

01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
art
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
program you don't have to have it but
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
you're required to have a Arts
 
01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
program Arts
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum it says right up top the
 
01:05:33.549 --> 01:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
local school board shall provide an Arts
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
education curriculum shall right now the
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
things that you choose to within that
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
program is something that's your choice
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
that so we're going from a a a program
 
01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.549 align:start position:0%
that so we're going from a a a program
that

01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
that was required to provide these I'm
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
just looking at the very first but I
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
think it's the same conversation
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
everyone these first
 
01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.230 align:start position:0%
everyone these first
seven

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
areas no longer requiring them school
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
boards to do those seven areas as a
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
minimum standard but these are examples
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
of things you could
 
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:21.799 align:start position:0%
do is that is that how that's being
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
read I think it comes down to our having
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
to really get a good handle on what is
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
program yeah program is that big
 
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
umbrella and then underneath that
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
umbrella you have those three components
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
we talked about curriculum instruction
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
assessment and there that is the that's
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
where the latitude is you don't have any
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
latitude as far as providing a program
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
you shall provide
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
art within that then you're going
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
to within curriculum instruction and
 
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
assessment provide those things but
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to also you must address
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
the academic standards associated with
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
art and that's why we're trying to get a
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
definition somewhere or not
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
definition we want to see the academic
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
standards I asked a question I've asked
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
the committee in the public here before
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
show me the academic standards and the
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
answer is the Frameworks M but we don't
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
have Frameworks that's out of law right
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
now so so we really can't really point
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
to academic
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
standards that the state board has
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
approved those by way the Frameworks but
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory law now supporting
 
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.630 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory law now supporting
those

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and and you look at
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks can you find the academic
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
standards within or do you see something
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
just like this page right here with a
 
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
whole lot of words on it but not
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
specific academic standards I may be off
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
course here but you know if I was a
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
school principal I'd want to know what
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
are the academic standards for social
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
studies and or for
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
math well or or just sticking with with
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
the very first piece right here because
 
01:08:10.269 --> 01:08:10.279 align:start position:0%
I think it's it it it applies whether
 
01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking you know math or science
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
social studies this first section is
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
talking about Arts
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
education um and and and it's currently
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
it requires a program that that includes
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.829 align:start position:0%
 
seven

01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
items and I don't know if these are the
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
seven items that should be the minimum
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
um comp you know the only place you're
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
going to cont underneath the definition
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
of curriculum and I wrote it when we put
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
it in there it says curriculum means
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
lessons an academic content taught in
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
school or in a specific course or
 
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.430 align:start position:0%
school or in a specific course or
program

01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
so and that was done a lot in
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
conjunction with CTE believe it or not
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
because we have courses that lead to
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
that program the total program as a
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
whole the same thing happens with the
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
teaching of reading in schools as
 
01:09:09.719 --> 01:09:12.149 align:start position:0%
teaching of reading in schools as
well

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
so I see program as as a larger
 
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
component than the individual course and
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
I think in the top part where we see
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
Arts education program is accurate what
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
we have now and then we get down into
 
01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
the curricular instructional and
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
assessment stuff down below where
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
there's more flexibility for the
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
district to teach and use so so maybe Mr
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
chair that's that you know if if um if
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to take away of take take
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
not take away if we were going to make
 
01:09:48.669 --> 01:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
changes to the
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
the the statutes and the associated
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
minimum academic standards that
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
providing some definition behind
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
program and then and then um specific
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
definitions to um to curriculum
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
instruction and assessment and each one
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
of those things has has you know you can
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
drill down into each one of those
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
components right I mean I don't know but
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
assessment you'd have competency you'd
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
have other assessment local
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
assessment you're not talk
 
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.430 align:start position:0%
assessment you're not talk
yeah

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
and then you'd have the the core content
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
areas which which we've talked about
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
before Mr chair the substantive
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
educational content of an adequate
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
education in
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
e2a see
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
that page
 
01:10:54.239 --> 01:10:58.750 align:start position:0%
that page
547

01:10:58.750 --> 01:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
reference has 193 c23 where where where
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
are you Linda page turn turn on your mic
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah page 547 yeah um over under
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
C3 3 which is the one that's you know in
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
in section two of this Arts
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum um it says the following
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
criteria shall be used in the
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
development of
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
program the academic standards specify
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
what students should know and be able to
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
do be clearly defined before assessment
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
procedures and exercises are developed
 
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
and then it goes down through um
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
teachers shall be involved in designing
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
and using assessment systems
 
01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
so as you said assessment is a part of
 
01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
this is it yeah is a part of the program
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
was part of the program yep and it it
 
01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:56.679 align:start position:0%
says academic standards
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
specify what students should know and be
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
do I'm looking at initial
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
proposal page four it talks
 
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
proposal page four it talks
about

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
um reer technical
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
education B says An approved CTE program
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
should be one that program
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
it then talks about curriculum specific
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
competencies um it talks about
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
assessments and nationally recognized
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
Career Cluster areas agriculture
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
government Hospitality Etc all
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
underneath the
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
program right not get then if you wanted
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
to get into um curriculum for
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hospitality that would be something
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
different so I I don't see any problem
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
here in terms of it as I think chairman
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
lad said program is the
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
umbrella you know they're using the word
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
program the page that uh represent
 
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
Tanner just referenced there is a
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
definition for
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
program but they talk about that
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
definition for the Improvement and
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
assessment component of this that's so
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's a it's relevant to that chapter
 
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and and if you were
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
writing this like you did the CTE
 
01:13:26.189 --> 01:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
program that that on page four that
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
you're just doing where it talks about
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know all the things in the CTE and
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying that people specialized in
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
in business and postsecondary education
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
aligned with National Industry standards
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
Etc on the top in in our Public School
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
Systems it that would have been the
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
Frameworks where art people people who
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
are Professionals in art education would
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
get together and decide the the
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
necessary parts of that particular
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
education or music I mean to kind of jam
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
them all together is kind of hard cuz
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
music is a little bit different but um
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know here under CTE you've allowed
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
the different groups the nationally
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
recognized clear clusters the groups
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
within that to set out the the standards
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
and yet with Public Schools you've got
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
all this other stuff that hasn't that
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
isn't specific there's nobody from the
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
Arts you know it used to be that social
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
studies teachers got together um people
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
in SEC postsecondary whole bunch of and
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
they would they would make the
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and for the standards and
 
01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's not done
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
know um the another U point on the
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
section in the initial proposal that
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
represent of cordelli was just
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
referencing under
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
CTE on
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
page page four
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
um the replacement of the word program
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
with curriculum wasn't to replace
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
program with curriculum but it's being
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
used as a as an adjective to describe
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
the competencies so it's it's it's
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
assessment that's being discussed there
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
so whether those competencies are
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
program specific competencies or
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum specific competencies and if
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
program is the combination of curriculum
 
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
instruction and assessment
 
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
then then you
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
know um curriculum specific competencies
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
would seem to
 
01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
be because you're doing an assessment
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
independent of instruction instruction
 
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
is is what facilitates getting you
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
getting getting from the curriculum to
 
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
the assessment right right
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
yes that's the peanut butter and jelly
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
between the two other parts and and so
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
um so the assessment is to the
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum which would
 
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
make sense to me not being a
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
teacher fluffing utter yeah the fluffing
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
cookie well I think this element is just
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
confusing in everything we're going to
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
be looking at today yeah but I think
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
what representative Tanner has has
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
identified here is that repl not every
 
01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
time program is replaced by curriculum
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
does it do the same thing in some cases
 
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's a clarifier in other cases it
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
meaning yeah they're using it two
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
different ways
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
here I feel like I'm stuck in traffic on
 
01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
here I feel like I'm stuck in traffic on
Route

01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
Route
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
three I'm just watching a traffic go by
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
the house at 10:30 11 o'clock at night
 
01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:02.980 align:start position:0%
bumper bumper on Route 10 9 o' really
 
01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.229 align:start position:0%
bumper bumper on Route 10 9 o' really
[Music]

01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah should have followed you Lind I got
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
to remind people too we have a on Route
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
10 going through hail corner there's a
 
01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.110 align:start position:0%
10 going through hail corner there's a
speed

01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
speed
 
01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
limit not not at night and that crew
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
last night was doing 60 70 miles hour in
 
01:17:17.159 --> 01:17:19.470 align:start position:0%
last night was doing 60 70 miles hour in
a

01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
35 we've been sitting for three hours
 
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.430 align:start position:0%
35 we've been sitting for three hours
yeah

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess we're being recorded so I'm
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
not going to admit anything on the K
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
right well where are we on yeah where
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
where are we going I I think I think we
 
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
got to come up with with questions for
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
the department and
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
um there's I think goes back to the very
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
first thing you were saying at the top
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
here and by putting curriculum on top of
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
all these things it starts to me like
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're starting
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
control yeah
 
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.430 align:start position:0%
control yeah
yeah

01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay let's try to review a few things
 
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
definition of both both or both the
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
right so so Mr chair just some notes
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
that I took um you know how is program
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
defined talking about I like what
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock talked about the CIA
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction assessment um
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
where where program is being replaced
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
with the word curriculum what does that
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
do in in you know because I think it
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
does different things different places
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
and listed an example such as 30631
 
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely yep and then as 30 631 but
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
then also as we just talked about in
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
30633 replacing program with curriculum
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
is just
 
01:19:37.629 --> 01:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
modifying the compet it's it's talking
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
about describing the competencies and
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
the curriculum based competencies not
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
program on that particular section
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 33 on page five
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
going down to number seven there offers
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
approved CTE
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
programs yeah they have program s with
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know with courses involved within so
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're using programs there as the
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
umbrella as an umbrella that has
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
programs underneath it yes yeah so
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
yeah um but then Mr chair you also
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
talked about is is is the state taking
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
on responsibility of curriculum as
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
Frameworks you sort of pose that as a as
 
01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.629 align:start position:0%
Frameworks you sort of pose that as a as
a

01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.639 --> 01:20:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
and then representative Cornell had you
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
know the changes from shall to May um
 
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
standards what's up you're not sitting
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
at bar right well I I think the shall in
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
May you shall provide a
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
program you shall provide that within
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
that program you get the
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
maze but the Statewide assessment is
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
determine the it's going to should be
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
based off your academic standards for
 
01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.189 align:start position:0%
based off your academic standards for
that

01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:12.199 --> 01:21:14.709 align:start position:0%
that
program

01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
and the competencies which follow along
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
where you are on those
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
standards so so that I think there is a
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
a place for
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
May a lot of times we put in legislation
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
such as or not limited to may you know
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
they may not have a component of this
 
01:21:37.709 --> 01:21:37.719 align:start position:0%
like I mentioned on number six there on
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
the first page Crossing out the F use
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
technology as a way to create perform
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
and respond in various art disciplines
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
you may not as as part of your art
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
program use technology you may or music
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
or music
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a local but I would I would
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
just like to know what what they were
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
thinking of when they did why they did
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
that just and it may be okay I would
 
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
just like to to hear why okay
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.550 align:start position:0%
 
noted

01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
noted
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
should so so that's a that's a a good
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
question but I don't think there's a
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that every student take in
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
our class but there's a requirement for
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
every High School to provide a a program
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
that meets the current minimum standards
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
but now they have to take well you'd
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
have to go look at that chart on the 306
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
rules and see if of the 20 required C
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know credits right is there
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
something required in art yeah I would
 
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
venture there is for for a graduation
 
01:22:56.110 --> 01:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
credit yeah yeah
 
01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.470 align:start position:0%
credit yeah yeah
[Music]

01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
you and graduation competencies differ
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
from District to District so so let's
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
just love love you know speculating here
 
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
but so if there was let's say a a half
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
credit graduation requirement for art
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
that it could be in any of dance it
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
could be in dance it doesn't have to be
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
in art history right but it doesn't have
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be in art history
 
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
right but
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
but schools currently under the minimum
 
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
standards are required to provide a
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
program which includes each of these
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
seven components so so it doesn't have
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
to be all within the
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
same class for lack of a you know course
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better word but um but the
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
schools have to provide the opportunity
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
for students to take a
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
course that gets you these
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so in Manchester right now they're
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
required to have four credits of English
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
three credits of math two credits of
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
science two and a half credits of social
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
studies one credit of fizzed and one
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
half credit each of art computer
 
01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:17.639 align:start position:0%
literacy and health along with six
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
electives they're increasing that in
 
01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:31.030 align:start position:0%
electives they're increasing that in
2027

01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
so the so the half Credit in in art that
 
01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.669 align:start position:0%
so the so the half Credit in in art that
Manchester

01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
requires is not necessarily going to
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
get a student who just takes that half
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
credit all of these
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
seven areas in there but but Manchester
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
has to but but a student that wants to
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
maybe have have four out of their six
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
electives also in art they're going to
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
be able to really extend into
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
this and that's where the students voice
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
and choice comes it and if you look at
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
the first word in all the top seven ones
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
the Sy system systematic and sequential
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
you have you know the words like create
 
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
perform participate analyze recognize
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
relate use and become familiar so those
 
01:25:21.239 --> 01:25:22.950 align:start position:0%
relate use and become familiar so those
are

01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
the those are what would guide you as
 
01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
to you know how you would teach it how
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
you would set up your teaching that you
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.239 --> 01:25:56.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
I'm looking on the uh at the final
 
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
proposal on page
 
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.030 align:start position:0%
proposal on page
189

01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
189
 
01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.149 align:start position:0%
189
20

01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
21 uh where they're talking about High
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
School curriculum credits and
 
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.149 align:start position:0%
School curriculum credits and
co-curricular

01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
co-curricular
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
programs the local school board shall
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
require that the that the curriculum
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
content and learning opportunities
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
developed for each High School outlines
 
01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
comp for each High School
 
01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:29.390 align:start position:0%
comp for each High School
outlines

01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
competencies that doesn't make much
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
sense doesn't make much sense does it
 
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
but then it lists all these program
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.239 --> 01:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
areas

01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
I understand what they're trying to do
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get a competency based
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
education moving in the
 
01:27:04.189 --> 01:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
state which I don't have any objections
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
to that we
 
01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.430 align:start position:0%
to that we
shouldn't

01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah I you know like B yesterday
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the Bia he's all for this compy
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
based had that's what they want we had
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
it it was Pace pardon me we had it yeah
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
we had that exactly but this doesn't go
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
back to that
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
program it cuts out rigor I don't think
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think people can hear you when
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
when because so we had pace which was
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
which was implemented in a lot of
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
schools we got a waiver from the federal
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
government yeah and it was it was
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
implemented at a lot of schools and we
 
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
had a lot of professional development on
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
it and then all of a sudden we did away
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
with it so some schools are still you
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
know a lot of teachers really most
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
teachers I think agree with Competency
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
Based and so you know they're still
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
doing a part of it but uh why aren't we
 
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
going back to what the Frameworks of
 
01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
out I don't know if we got the exception
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
from the federal government to do that
 
01:28:17.149 --> 01:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
pace is an
 
01:28:17.159 --> 01:28:18.830 align:start position:0%
pace is an
assessment

01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
process it's got the other two yes it
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
was also a national program that was
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
then you know it was developed in this
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
state yes by uh all
 
01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:38.310 align:start position:0%
state yes by uh all
leather

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
yeah righty anything else on this so I
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
guess we uh send our questions forward
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then revisit I think that what we
 
01:28:51.149 --> 01:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
need to do is send them right now over
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
to Nate green and Company m get a
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
response and have them come back and we
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
can meet again to chew on it heard me
 
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yes yes yes I think I think Dr
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
Green would be a really good person up
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
this yeah we have a little bit of time
 
01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
about

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to wrap it up a little bit
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
here program vers curriculum we need
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
definition of both of those
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
terms um in terms of the 306 rules here
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
um and we want
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
to on page five at the bottom of numbers
 
01:29:38.719 --> 01:29:45.669 align:start position:0%
to on page five at the bottom of numbers
38

01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
and9 the uh initial
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
proposal it talks about
 
01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
programs but you know so how we're using
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
program and how we're using curriculum
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's the Crux of what
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to do does curriculum
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
include which I don't think it does
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
instructional assessment but program
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
include curriculum the three curriculum
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
instruction assessment I think it should
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
should um and and I and I think the word
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
program in the old rules and in the
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
statute said I think program is not
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
always consistent on how it's beinged
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
and then we also represent Cornell's
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
issue at the top with a sh in the May
 
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
right is there anything else that's
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
specifically that we'd like to get some
 
01:30:36.679 --> 01:30:37.709 align:start position:0%
specifically that we'd like to get some
answers

01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
answers
 
01:30:37.719 --> 01:30:41.629 align:start position:0%
answers
on

01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
teach yeah I think that's see the these
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
this section of of rules references the
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
competencies back on Ed
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
30621 over and over and over again and
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
that was the the those pages I
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
referenced a second
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
ago and then you go look at the
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
definition of competencies I think
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
here yeah Linda I I think you you talked
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
about the definition of instruction as
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
well MH
 
01:31:24.719 --> 01:31:29.750 align:start position:0%
well MH
instruction

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
teaching so uh just to follow up on Pat
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
Cornell's that in a couple places where
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
it strikes out like the local school
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
board shall require a family and
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
consumer Science Education and
 
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
instead the local school board shall
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
provide um
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's the that's the difference
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
you know between requiring that a family
 
01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
and cons consumer science education
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum or program be provided and
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
they just cross it out and put just
 
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
provide that it's not
 
01:32:15.790 --> 01:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
confusion like on the uh initial
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
proposal on page
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
15 we're talking about physical
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
education your Bailey work represent
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
Tanner and
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
under B I guess it's a new B it used to
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
be one on page
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
15 systematic instruction and
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum is that within the program or
 
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
you see we're using these
 
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
terms differently
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.840 --> 01:33:17.350 align:start position:0%
 
consistent

01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay the other thing consistent with the
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
competencies the competencies are based
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
off what the academic standards
 
01:33:27.629 --> 01:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
where in the bar do you master or
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
exist question yeah you're talking about
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
competency standards I'm talking about
 
01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.149 align:start position:0%
competency standards I'm talking about
academic

01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
standards which are the which should be
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
the framework for competent controlling
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
it all mhm
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
yeah you measure competencies yeah yeah
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah that's going back to the old
 
01:34:08.830 --> 01:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
Frameworks which you can't find them you
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
know you can't find those standards
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
specifically saying academic standards
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
Frameworks so I got the impression that
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks yeah which is confusing in
 
01:34:32.910 --> 01:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay well if you can think of any
 
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
other questions let us know so I can get
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
this put together and get over to him
 
01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:47.109 align:start position:0%
this put together and get over to him
right

01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
off but I think the best person Comer
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.639 --> 01:34:55.950 align:start position:0%
 
green

01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
anything

01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
else do we know who actually wrote These
 
01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
or pardon me do you know who actually
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
wrote These or no okay I have no idea
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
there I know there was a contracted
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
service but where it's been how long has
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
this been year and a half two
 
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
years there's been a lot of versions
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
since that
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
original yeah see here we're working off
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
of a version which is the
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
initial and the other is the
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
final right are we going to get a side
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
by side from Jen with when we when we do
 
01:35:42.109 --> 01:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
the 306 is a total we will the final
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
with the with the when we do that legis
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
she's busy doing some three side byid
 
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
now individual Senate bills which are
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
coming in from various committees and we
 
01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:53.239 align:start position:0%
have one coming down we're going to be
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
looking at later today which is a side
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
by side
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
for S SP
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
378 s378 is one that's dealing with the
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
performance-based school accountability
 
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
system I ask that we get a side by side
 
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.310 align:start position:0%
system I ask that we get a side by side
for

01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
that we're going no but something we
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
discuss no that one's not
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
scheduled but it'll be handed out so and
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
and then I think a final thing that
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be helpful Mr chair I'm looking
 
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.990 align:start position:0%
would be helpful Mr chair I'm looking
for

01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.750 align:start position:0%
for
my

01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.350 align:start position:0%
my
uh

01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
oh on the
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
um on the
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
the the the two-pager that was um handed
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
out 20
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
24-42 it's the notice number academic
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
public schools on page two they have the
 
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
date of the deadline for submission and
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
right of April 30th public hearing on
 
01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:57.390 align:start position:0%
right of April 30th public hearing on
April

01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
April
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
11th that it would be good to see where
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
um where the
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
timeline would
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
include this committee making its
 
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
um position or recommendations whatever
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know whatever it's called and and
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
then the uh the statutory um uh
 
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee the 193
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
e committee that that you chair yeah
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
when when it needs to when it needs to
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
be I'm not looking for a specific date
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
but an order of operations that that um
 
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
you know the State Board had to do
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
something to get these rules to us these
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
proposed rules to us and then the ad hoc

committee is meeting has to do something
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
the the oversight and
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
accountability statutory
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
committee has to meet and do something
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
and then J and then the state board has
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
has to meet and do something because the
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
accountability the accountability and
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
oversight committee has to do something
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
before the State Board votes for
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
approval that's actually in statute of
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
of which approval of which of academic
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
standards of academic of which some of
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
these fall into that area fall into that
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
area even even the very first one we
 
01:38:26.189 --> 01:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
were looking at here which goes from a
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
sh to a May provide these areas content
 
01:38:33.589 --> 01:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
areas um and then and then following
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the um the the state
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
board can make an approval and then it
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
goes from there but it would be it would
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
be good to see that stepbystep process
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
and how that lines up so that we're
 
01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:55.589 align:start position:0%
and how that lines up so that we're
clear

01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
now also we need to reference page 55
 
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
559 under
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
19328 where it says the minimum
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval for
 
01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
the areas identified in paragraph one
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's the substantive educational
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
education um goes on shall constitute
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for delivery of an
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
adequate education the general court
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
shall periodically but not less than
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
every 10 years review revise update as
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
necessary the minimum standards
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
identified in paragraph
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
one so we have responsibility for
 
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
looking at everything associated with
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
that those content areas right
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
there and where they where are the
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
overlapping these these these standards
 
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
right here um making sure that they're
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
being met make sure they're and when
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're revised they're still being met
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's our responsibility and that's why
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
the bill was put forward where we're now
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
including the minimum standard of public
 
01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.350 align:start position:0%
including the minimum standard of public
school

01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
approval and I hope they're still being
 
01:40:02.669 --> 01:40:02.679 align:start position:0%
applyed by
 
01:40:02.679 --> 01:40:04.790 align:start position:0%
applyed by
Doe

01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
Doe
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
um are you know part of our oversight
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility rather than just academic
 
01:40:14.109 --> 01:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
standards and are receiving the
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
authority to do that not under the
 
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committee but right there on
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
read yeah how can all these changes not
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
have any fiscal
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
cost I I was just looking at that fiscal
 
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
impact statement it says there's no
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
difference in costs when comparing
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
comparing the proposed rules it seems
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
with all those changes that's going
 
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
to take a lot of local money that's why
 
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:51.229 align:start position:0%
 
Nate

01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay we are called quits here today
 
01:40:56.669 --> 01:40:56.679 align:start position:0%
I think we're just you know we're
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
searching but I I think we've got our
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
basic questions so we can get those over
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
the Nate have Nate respond to us come
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
back to this group
 
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
again and we'll go from there
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%

03:41:22.229 --> 03:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
recognizing the value of that program
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
and how that is expanding and how it's
 
03:41:27.269 --> 03:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
so much needed in this state uh the
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
amendment on line 9 of
 
03:41:34.110 --> 03:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
1410 States nine members representing

classroom teachers education Specialists
 
03:41:38.149 --> 03:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
or instructional Specialists that's
 
03:41:40.750 --> 03:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
already in-law of which one shall be a

Career Technical education
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
teacher and on on line
 
03:41:47.040 --> 03:41:48.630 align:start position:0%
teacher and on on line
13

03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
13
 
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
14 there is change there as well after
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
we had the hearing we had this input as
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
well but this is phrased a little
 
03:41:58.269 --> 03:41:58.279 align:start position:0%
differently on 11 uh line 11 says nine
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
members representing higher education
 
03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
education Administration with at least
 
03:42:03.429 --> 03:42:03.439 align:start position:0%
three employed by community college
 
03:42:06.070 --> 03:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire member
 
03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
institution education department or
 
03:42:10.389 --> 03:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
university system New Hampshire member
 
03:42:12.910 --> 03:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
institution education department and
 
03:42:15.389 --> 03:42:15.399 align:start position:0%
with at least one employed at as a
 
03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
Career Technical education principal so
 
03:42:20.349 --> 03:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
by doing it this way we're inserting the
 
03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
principal into the category it's dealing
 
03:42:22.359 --> 03:42:23.149 align:start position:0%
principal into the category it's dealing
with

03:42:23.149 --> 03:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:42:25.030 --> 03:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
Administration and we can keep the
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
number stable at 21 people on the
 
03:42:30.309 --> 03:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards Board but we've
 
03:42:33.790 --> 03:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
been able to put all that two people
 
03:42:36.750 --> 03:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance in in CT Career
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
Technical education which is in all the
 
03:42:42.550 --> 03:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
schools throughout 25 centers in the
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
state and a couple of them out outside
 
03:42:48.790 --> 03:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
and Vermont but and with instructors the
 
03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
talent that we see there is really
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful I met with the advisory
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
Council yesterday I see what's going on
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
at conquered high in their CTE
 
03:43:02.389 --> 03:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
program when I see folks coming out one
 
03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
young man we talked to in terms of
 
03:43:07.149 --> 03:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
electrical engineering what do you get
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
expect to get on an hourly wage when you
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
graduate from high school I expect to
 
03:43:15.510 --> 03:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
get around $60 per hour and with
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
overtime I'm guaranteed over $100 per
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
hour that's where we want our young
 
03:43:22.189 --> 03:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
people going getting that skill and
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that's why we need to have
 
03:43:26.309 --> 03:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
this on that board thank
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%

something yeah it goes along with this
 
03:43:45.189 --> 03:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
morning thank you um just the question
 
03:43:48.070 --> 03:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
repres letter on the part that says a
 
03:43:50.349 --> 03:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
principal uh Career Technical principal
 
03:43:51.550 --> 03:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
are they are they classified as a
 
03:43:54.830 --> 03:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
principal or as a director the the uh it
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
used to be director Steve
 
03:44:01.269 --> 03:44:01.279 align:start position:0%
rothberg it's no longer he left and they
 
03:44:03.070 --> 03:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
are splitting that governance apart
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're in the same building but it's
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
now principal she is a principal of the
 
03:44:11.149 --> 03:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
CTE program and with
 
03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
that she is able to do much much more
 
03:44:19.389 --> 03:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
with um Workforce with manufacturing
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
business in in the area and she's
 
03:44:24.429 --> 03:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
drawing from 13 different sending
 
03:44:26.950 --> 03:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
schools as a principal she has that
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
credential okay but she also has a
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
background in business okay and so yes
 
03:44:35.630 --> 03:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
we do have people that are title
 
03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
principal in these centers and that's
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
going to grow seeing that it's
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely too much for where Steve was
 
03:44:46.510 --> 03:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
before where he was vice principal SL
 
03:44:49.750 --> 03:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
director that was it's like having the
 
03:44:51.389 --> 03:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
president of a college and Provost in
 
03:44:53.389 --> 03:44:53.399 align:start position:0%
one person it's too much it's the follow
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
up Mr M Mr chairman follow up yes the
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
only thank you Mr represent the only I
 
03:44:59.830 --> 03:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
was thinking about the other career CTE
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
directors around the state this was sort
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
of this would sort of preclude them and
 
03:45:06.349 --> 03:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
just make it just for the the conquered
 
03:45:08.070 --> 03:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
one if if I read that correctly that's
 
03:45:10.349 --> 03:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
all I thought the intent was open up to
 
03:45:13.110 --> 03:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
that position of CTE
 
03:45:15.950 --> 03:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
director Steve here might have something
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
that that that's it's it's already
 
03:45:19.870 --> 03:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
permissible to have other directors on
 
03:45:21.870 --> 03:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
that in fact I believe that they don't
 
03:45:25.389 --> 03:45:25.399 align:start position:0%
have that board filled thank you
 
03:45:28.710 --> 03:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
yeah do you want you're you're Chang um
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um Mr applebe um do you have a
 
03:45:38.750 --> 03:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:41.630 --> 03:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr chair and good afternoon
 
03:45:43.389 --> 03:45:43.399 align:start position:0%
everyone I apologize for dressing down
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
it's a little warm just come from
 
03:45:47.070 --> 03:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
shoveling snow a few days ago and now
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's 80° so um the title for many years
 
03:45:54.030 --> 03:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
was CT director the last time the
 
03:45:55.870 --> 03:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
administrative Rule and endorsement was
 
03:45:58.510 --> 03:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
updated several years ago at the request
 
03:46:01.309 --> 03:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
of the CT directors it was changed in in
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
our um uh administrative rules to CTE
 
03:46:07.510 --> 03:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
principal so all individuals who current
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
who held a CTE director license that the
 
03:46:12.990 --> 03:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
wording was changed to principal because
 
03:46:15.950 --> 03:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
the requirements to be a CTE principal
 
03:46:18.910 --> 03:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
or director even before were all of the
 
03:46:21.309 --> 03:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
principal requirements and then
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
additionally some business requirements
 
03:46:25.710 --> 03:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
so they're all CT principles today
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
Statewide thank you thank you so much uh

place is outdated not really meeting the
 
03:53:44.910 --> 03:53:44.920 align:start position:0%

capital construction plan and so on the
 
03:54:10.550 --> 03:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
other addition to this on that you
 
03:54:12.590 --> 03:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
notice on the amendment self there's a
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
line eight and it puts in two
 
03:54:18.510 --> 03:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
representatives of business and industry
 
03:54:20.349 --> 03:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
so we can have folks from the field from
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
the workforce also engaged with those
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%

03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
Steve I was just trying to be clear
 
03:56:34.750 --> 03:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
well from understanding what he just
 
03:56:38.590 --> 03:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
said he probably yes
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
um because apparently it changed a few
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
years ago I missed it but I think a
 
03:56:45.870 --> 03:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
number of us missed
 
03:56:48.269 --> 03:56:48.279 align:start position:0%
it so my question represent cour earli
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
was that on line 12 it says that the
 
03:56:51.790 --> 03:56:51.800 align:start position:0%
there should be three folks from C to
 
03:56:54.030 --> 03:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
directors we just clarified this will be
 
03:56:57.070 --> 03:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
principles I lo at or make amendment I
 
03:56:57.080 --> 03:56:58.590 align:start position:0%
principles I lo at or make amendment I
just

03:56:58.590 --> 03:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:57:03.070 --> 03:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
questioning right any further
 
03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
questions once is the chairman going to
 
03:57:08.469 --> 03:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:10.590 --> 03:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
incorrect just you know there's a number
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
of ways it can be
 
03:57:16.269 --> 03:57:16.279 align:start position:0%
corrected uh say yes or no
 
03:57:18.269 --> 03:57:18.279 align:start position:0%
okay rather than having to write
 
03:57:20.149 --> 03:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
something right now I would just prefer
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
to have the Senate say okay we can
 
03:57:23.710 --> 03:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
request the committee of conference to
 
03:57:25.630 --> 03:57:25.640 align:start position:0%

04:01:22.870 --> 04:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
achievement and going down looking
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
through uh the other criteria that are
 
04:01:29.950 --> 04:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
listed here on lines 13 through uh 20 in
 
04:01:29.960 --> 04:01:30.990 align:start position:0%
listed here on lines 13 through uh 20 in
the

04:01:30.990 --> 04:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:35.149 --> 04:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
portfolio um there there is an article
 
04:01:37.790 --> 04:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
item there on line 15 I think is really
 
04:01:40.389 --> 04:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
important and this is oftentimes what I
 
04:01:43.110 --> 04:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
see as a a professional Master Level
 
04:01:45.550 --> 04:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
teacher and I been in the business for
 
04:01:48.429 --> 04:01:48.439 align:start position:0%
well over 30 years in the classroom as
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
as an elementary principal
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
administrator uh High School expectation
 
04:01:55.630 --> 04:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
for students ensuring that each child
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
develops and realizes their full
 
04:02:00.990 --> 04:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
academic and social potential so you
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
want to have high expectations for every
 
04:02:06.030 --> 04:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
kid in that class regardless of where
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
they're from what they are Etc Johnny
 
04:02:11.149 --> 04:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
might be a real you know nut job but you
 
04:02:12.670 --> 04:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
have to have high
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
expectations and so I think this
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
extremely important and the master
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
teacher can do this and the master
 
04:02:23.229 --> 04:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
teacher also inspires other
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
teachers and and what you see by that is
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
the whole school environment improving
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
student performance improves pride in
 
04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
the building improves and that's what we
 
04:02:38.110 --> 04:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
want to see in education so I I I
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate the amendment being you know
 
04:02:46.950 --> 04:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:50.429 --> 04:02:50.439 align:start position:0%
21 further discussion yes represent
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank CH this the question and
 
04:02:55.950 --> 04:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
I I I do support the the bill I I was
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
just curious on uh item line a on the
 
04:03:02.429 --> 04:03:02.439 align:start position:0%
amendment how are you going to measure
 
04:03:06.990 --> 04:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
excellence and and on line 17 the the
 
04:03:07.000 --> 04:03:08.670 align:start position:0%
excellence and and on line 17 the the
factor

04:03:08.670 --> 04:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
factor
 
04:03:10.389 --> 04:03:10.399 align:start position:0%
Congeniality what that has to do with
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
the master
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
teacher how you work with the others
 
04:03:16.349 --> 04:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
around you collaborate on the skills and
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge and and performance and
 
04:03:21.710 --> 04:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
development Congeniality is how you
 
04:03:25.710 --> 04:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
interrelate uh personality wise um where
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
I found that was from a man called
 
04:03:27.760 --> 04:03:28.670 align:start position:0%
I found that was from a man called
William

04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
William
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
Bennett remember who William Bennett was
 
04:03:33.630 --> 04:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Education from man I think
 
04:03:37.870 --> 04:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
1986 underneath Reagan and this is one
 
04:03:41.070 --> 04:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
he wrote a book that which works and
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
this is one of the areas which he
 
04:03:45.229 --> 04:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
indicated many of these things which are
 
04:03:47.790 --> 04:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
already written here right have been
 
04:03:50.309 --> 04:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
added to added to for example like on
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
line 14 leadership but also
 
04:03:56.429 --> 04:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
supervision there's two components there
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
that came out of that book as well so
 
04:04:00.110 --> 04:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
this is where this came
 
04:04:02.950 --> 04:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
from okay thank

motion first please and a but too am I
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
didn't I already move this no I'm moving
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
it as a I'll I'll second that and you
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
you have the floor okay thank
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
you I believe uh when we discussed this
 
04:05:32.710 --> 04:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
bill um it was acknowledged that we
 
04:05:34.590 --> 04:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
don't have any Master Teachers in the
 
04:05:36.189 --> 04:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire not for the lack
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
of qualified individuals for the
 
04:05:41.389 --> 04:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
position but it was put forth I think
 
04:05:44.830 --> 04:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
rather reasonably that there is a uh
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
substantial and perhaps prohibitive
 
04:05:51.670 --> 04:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
Financial hurdle that persons uh have to
 
04:05:55.030 --> 04:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
jump uh in order to be able to qualify
 
04:05:58.269 --> 04:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
for uh the master teacher uh
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
certification so what this bill does is
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
it substantially lowers that and so it
 
04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
makes it uh non prohibitive now for
 
04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
individuals to seek to pursue this from
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
a financial standpoint second um we we
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
want to have teachers who are excellent
 
04:06:18.189 --> 04:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
in their field be encouraged to uh
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
pursue this uh this recognition and I
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
think most importantly Mr chairman um
 
04:06:27.630 --> 04:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
what this does is that this provides a
 
04:06:32.110 --> 04:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
very real incentive uh for teachers and
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
um therefore uh the beneficiaries being
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh students to see um Excellence improve
 
04:06:41.110 --> 04:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
in um the particular areas in which the
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
individual would be uh certified as a
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
master teacher this is I think a win-win
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
all the way
 
04:06:50.110 --> 04:06:50.120 align:start position:0%

um as a trustee with the university
 
04:08:32.429 --> 04:08:32.439 align:start position:0%
system right now I'm very familiar with
 
04:08:34.510 --> 04:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on internally in fact we're
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
meeting on Friday to interview our new
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
and determine who will be our new
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
president for
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
UNH um however we also have a uh a a
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
board a group of Trustees which has
 
04:08:52.109 --> 04:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
students from the various campuses as
 
04:08:54.030 --> 04:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
participants as you recall when this was
 
04:08:57.710 --> 04:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
introduced by Senator gray he was
 
04:09:01.469 --> 04:09:01.479 align:start position:0%
recommending that there be two student
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the trustees we have
 
04:09:04.640 --> 04:09:05.670 align:start position:0%
Representatives on the trustees we have
three

04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:09:08.910 --> 04:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
campuses uh we used to have four and
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
when Granite State was merged into UNH
 
04:09:14.189 --> 04:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
that system
 
04:09:17.389 --> 04:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh with with Manchester and law and and
 
04:09:20.109 --> 04:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
the main campus uh we ended up with
 
04:09:25.070 --> 04:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
three campuses Keane Plymouth and UNH
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
but we only have two slots available the
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
trustees themselves voted you
 
04:09:36.109 --> 04:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly to have three slots so
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
that for the that period of the three
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
years you're going to have a
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
representative from each of the campuses
 
04:09:46.510 --> 04:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
we also have an alumnus or alumni uh
 
04:09:48.630 --> 04:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
slot for Granite State
 
04:09:51.510 --> 04:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
College and that person's on right now
 
04:09:53.229 --> 04:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
is a very active
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
participant and so the way this bill is
 
04:10:00.510 --> 04:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh written that parti particular slot
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
will cease June 30 2025 at the end of
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
her term on on the trustees so what this
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
does it instead of putting two there it
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
UPS it to three um I will say that the
 
04:10:16.950 --> 04:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
the student trustees are very very well
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
engaged I'm going to be meeting with a
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
group in May up at Plymouth state
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're active they they're watching
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
what we do they're watching what the
 
04:10:27.550 --> 04:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
state does in terms of education and
 
04:10:29.309 --> 04:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
they're very very involved what's even
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
what's going on right now with the the
 
04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
report that came out from the governor's
 
04:10:36.389 --> 04:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
task force um where we're going in terms
 
04:10:41.109 --> 04:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
of um alignment of and strategies to
 
04:10:43.870 --> 04:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
make our system more efficient but still
 
04:10:45.950 --> 04:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
continue to be the great system that it
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
is so I would urge us to consider 1425
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the positive um it would allow these
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh three positions so each campus will
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
have their own um uh senate or our uh
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
trustee representative thank you very
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
much oh well said by the chair great
 
04:11:08.349 --> 04:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any further comment on the
 
04:11:10.389 --> 04:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
amendment by the
 
04:11:14.910 --> 04:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
committee see nothing oh I'm sorry
 
04:11:18.189 --> 04:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock chair I just question
 
04:11:20.149 --> 04:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I understand during the testimony
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
they talked about the position uh of the
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
alumni and I see that in the amendment
 
04:11:27.269 --> 04:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
you moved it to 2025 that would call
 
04:11:30.990 --> 04:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
Align with the that person's uh getting
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
done I wonder why if it's such a
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
valuable position we take it
 
04:11:38.109 --> 04:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
out why that why the alumni position the
 
04:11:40.429 --> 04:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
institution is important and obviously
 
04:11:42.990 --> 04:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
it is we're extending the date why would
 
04:11:44.309 --> 04:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
we think take that person off the board
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
not that person but that off the board
 
04:11:48.750 --> 04:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
it's a recommendation of the trustees
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
the total group it's
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
also a the campus no longer exists it's
 
04:11:55.279 --> 04:11:56.389 align:start position:0%
also a the campus no longer exists it's
now

04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
doe um and I understand there are alumni
 
04:12:03.149 --> 04:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
but they also now are part of the same
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
group that's going to be recognized with
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
UNH so the alumni of Granite State will
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
now be included within the alumni un
 
04:12:14.429 --> 04:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
