there

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
83631<00:26:25.760><c> and</c><00:26:25.880><c> then</c><00:26:26.120><c> looking</c><00:26:26.480><c> at</c><00:26:27.279><c> what</c><00:26:27.440><c> we</c><00:26:27.679><c> have</c>

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
83631 and then looking at what we have
 

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:37.430 align:start position:0%
83631 and then looking at what we have
here

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.070 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:26:37.960><c> I</c><00:26:38.159><c> guess</c><00:26:38.399><c> the</c><00:26:38.520><c> question</c><00:26:38.799><c> what's</c><00:26:38.960><c> the</c>

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question what's the
 

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.789 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question what's the
difference<00:26:39.320><c> between</c><00:26:39.559><c> curriculum</c><00:26:40.000><c> and</c>

00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:45.789 align:start position:0%
 
program<00:26:43.799><c> so</c><00:26:43.960><c> I</c><00:26:44.080><c> think</c><00:26:44.279><c> that's</c><00:26:44.480><c> a</c><00:26:44.840><c> that's</c><00:26:45.039><c> a</c><00:26:45.600><c> a</c>

00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
program so I think that's a that's a a
 

00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:48.350 align:start position:0%
program so I think that's a that's a a
question<00:26:46.480><c> also</c><00:26:46.880><c> when</c><00:26:47.039><c> you</c><00:26:47.600><c> look</c><00:26:47.840><c> looking</c><00:26:48.159><c> at</c>

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum include instruction because
 

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.029 align:start position:0%
curriculum include instruction because

00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
program sounds like it would include
 

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:38.909 align:start position:0%

so<00:27:39.559><c> so</c><00:27:40.039><c> maybe</c><00:27:40.399><c> one</c><00:27:40.720><c> definition</c><00:27:41.320><c> here</c><00:27:41.559><c> is</c><00:27:41.720><c> that</c>

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
so so maybe one definition here is that
 

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.789 align:start position:0%
so so maybe one definition here is that
program<00:27:42.799><c> is</c><00:27:43.039><c> curriculum</c><00:27:43.640><c> plus</c>

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
program is curriculum plus
 

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:48.149 align:start position:0%
program is curriculum plus
instruction<00:27:46.799><c> and</c><00:27:46.960><c> that's</c><00:27:47.240><c> being</c><00:27:47.760><c> so</c><00:27:48.000><c> the</c>

00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
instruction and that's being so the
 

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:52.470 align:start position:0%
instruction and that's being so the

I<00:58:00.280><c> I</c><00:58:00.400><c> think</c><00:58:00.640><c> that</c><00:58:00.839><c> might</c><00:58:01.119><c> sort</c><00:58:01.280><c> of</c><00:58:01.559><c> sum</c><00:58:01.839><c> up</c><00:58:02.160><c> what</c>

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
