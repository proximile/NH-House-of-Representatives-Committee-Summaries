good morning to the members of the

committee once again for the record
 
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Vose representing
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
the town of eping Rockingham District 5
 
00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm here this morning to introduce
 
00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 align:start position:0%
House Bill 696
 
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
FN exempting electricity generators from
 
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax and including
 
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
them under the Statewide education
 
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.629 align:start position:0%
them under the Statewide education
property

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
tax now you'll note that I didn't read
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
and relative to Communications Services
 
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.270 align:start position:0%
and relative to Communications Services
tax

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
revenues because that's actually not
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that is a mistake from
 
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative Services it's
 
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
a carryover from the title of a bill
 
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
that was submitted to the legislature
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
last year and for some reason OSS copied
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
the title even though the bill itself
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with con um
 
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
Communications Services tax
 
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
and we may try to fix it later I'm not
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
sure be Amendment yeah
 
00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so now let's talk about the
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
do in
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
uh last year we passed we uh took a bill
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
458 that was a duplicate of a bill that
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
than it tailing that bill what we did is
 
00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:36.670 align:start position:0%
than it tailing that bill what we did is
we

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
extended we use that bill as a vehicle
 
00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
to extend a commission that has been
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
studying the assessing of power
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
generation for two previous years so we
 
00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
passed that bill and recommissioned that
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
commission and it met eight times
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
between September 3rd and October 20 I
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
think was the last meeting 16 hours of
 
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
meetings to produce a report which was
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
sent to all of you yesterday by our
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee researcher Davis Allen thank
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
you Davis for doing that that commission
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
report contains 40 findings and two
 
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.430 align:start position:0%
report contains 40 findings and two
major

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations I hope you had a chance
 
00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
to to look at the
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
commission's uh report because a lot of
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
work went into that report
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
and it's very
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and basically the
 
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
conclusion that the report came to was
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
that generators of electricity are in
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
fact just
 
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers instead of manufacturing
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
toothpaste or cars or whatever they
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
manufacture electricity they are not
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
utilities therefore they shouldn't be
 
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
tax and because they are just
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers like any other
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer they should pay the
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax like
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
any other business taxpayer would pay so
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
exempts power generators from paying the
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
utility property tax and requires them
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
instead to pay the swept
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
tax pretty simple
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
concept and as you can see by reading
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
through the bill it's some pretty
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
complicated language to make that happen
 
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 align:start position:0%
but it's no more complicated
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
than stating that a generation facility
 
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's a Hydro Dam or a natural
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
gas power generation plant or a nuclear
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
Generation Plant is
 
00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
simply a manufacturer of electricity it
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
is not a
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
utility so what will the impact of this
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
change have by the way the change will
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
take effect January 1st of
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
2027 so it doesn't take effect
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
immediately what will be the effect of
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
this change well right now the utility
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
property tax collects about
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
12 uh million dollars 12 and a and a
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
half 12 and 3/4 million dollars from the
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
power generators in the
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
state and so and that money goes into
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so removing the
 
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
power generators or exempting the power
 
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
generators from paying that tax will
 
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
reduce monies going to the education
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
trust fund by about 12 and a half
 
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
million now currently there is about a a
 
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
$100 million surplus in the education
 
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.230 align:start position:0%
$100 million surplus in the education
trust

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
fund and if you read through the fiscal
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
note and by the way there is a uh
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
updated fiscal note for this bill the
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
one that's attached to the bill has a
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:22.910 align:start position:0%
 
1625

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
1625
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
and our committee researcher handed me a
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
new one that has a date on it
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.630 align:start position:0%
 
12825

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
12825
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
and this fiscal
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
note uh states
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
that education fun trust fund Revenue
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
will decrease by 5.36 million in fiscal
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
12.72-ounce at the stat statutorily
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
required amount of 363
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
million but the inclusion of property
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
employed in the generation of
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
electricity will result in a change to
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
the overall Statewide equalized
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
valuation and the swept rate so
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
basically it's going to turn out to be a
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
wash that the money that used to go to
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund from the U upt
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
from taxing these generators will be be
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh essentially made up by the money that
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
goes into swept as a
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
result and this bill has an FN attached
 
00:10:44.509 --> 00:10:44.519 align:start position:0%
to it so it's likely to go to either
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
ways and means or finance and there may
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
be an adjustment made at that time to
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund uh to raise the
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
cap from its current $363 million to an
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
amount that might be $112
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
million higher than that but I don't
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
know that for certain and that's for
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
decide now there are going to be several
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
other people speaking on this bill
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
um there is an important provision in
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that says that if a pilot
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
agreement a pilot agreement is a payment
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
in lie of taxes contract between a
 
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.030 align:start position:0%
in lie of taxes contract between a
business

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
and a town or
 
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
municipality and the bill says that if
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
there is an existing pilot in effect at
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
the time of the passage of this bill or
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
the time it takes effect which is
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
January 1st of
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
2027 then
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
that pilot will remain in
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
effect until the contractual end dat of
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
the pilot or until January 1st of 2020
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
2031 whichever comes first that's
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
important to protect existing pilot
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
agreements that uh as you will hear from
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
other people currently exist between for
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
example some of the hydro facilities in
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
the state and the municipalities in
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
reside I think that pretty much covers
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
the substance of the bill i' been happy
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
to take questions and I'll also point
 
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
out that we will hear testimony from
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
several other people um about the
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bill the important
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bills pretty widely
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
supported there is one organization
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
however that may object to the bill and
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
that is uh the municipal
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
Association because some
 
00:12:51.839 --> 00:12:53.550 align:start position:0%
Association because some
assessors

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
assessors
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
assert uh that in order to know what the
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
true value of a Our Generation
 
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.189 align:start position:0%
true value of a Our Generation
manufacturer

00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
is the assessors need access to a lot of
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
proprietary financial
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
data about the operation of the of the
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
company now we don't require any other
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in the state to provide
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
that kind of information
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
to uh people who assess their properties
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
so we don't the authors of this bill the
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
the myself and the prime sponsors of the
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the co-sponsors of this bill
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
don't feel that it's appropriate to
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
require power generators to reveal
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
proprietary information and as you will
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
hear in subsequent T testimony there is
 
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
a ton of information economic
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
information about these power gener
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
generators that's already
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
public due to the filings that they must
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
make to the federal government and to um
 
00:14:04.509 --> 00:14:04.519 align:start position:0%
state and local governments so that
 
00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:06.069 align:start position:0%
state and local governments so that
objection

00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
while it's understandable because the
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
assessors want to be able to put a
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
higher price tag on their
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
um assessment
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
case it's not necessarily fair to treat
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
these power gener op ators
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
differently I should mention that one of
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
the impetuses behind this
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is the disparity between
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue assessments for
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax and Municipal
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
assessments sometimes they can be
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
dramatic for example the SE nuclear
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
power plant Dr assesses the value of
 
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
that that plant at about a half a
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
billion dollars whereas um Municipal
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
assessors value it it well over a
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
billion what does that do that prompts
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
the owners of these power generation
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
facilities to go to court to litigate
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
and who pays the cost of the
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
litigation taxpayers and rate
 
00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:25.230 align:start position:0%
litigation taxpayers and rate
payers

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
payers
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
so by passing this bill
 
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.990 align:start position:0%
so by passing this bill
we

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
remove that Dr assessment from the
 
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.470 align:start position:0%
remove that Dr assessment from the
equation

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
equation
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
because the the power generators will no
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
longer be subject to that assessment
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
once they're not paying the utility
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
property tax that will significantly we
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
hope uh reduce the amount of litigation
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
that happens between municipalities and
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
the owners of these power generation
 
00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:59.590 align:start position:0%
the owners of these power generation
stations

00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
stations
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
so that's I think a a good enough
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
introduction to this legislation and I'd
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
questions I I have a question um in
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the language uh on line8 I
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
believe it is uh once payment of the
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
State education tax under RSA 63 colon
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
60 I'm sorry 76 colon 3 is required it
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
may be included in a payment in Le of
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
taxes pursuant to a new agreement
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
reached under RSA 72 colon 74 or it may
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
be paid in addition to a payment in Le
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
of taxes if the underlying agreement has
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
not expired or been reopened and
 
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
renegotiated I know you talked about uh
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
pilot providing those options but I
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
don't see any language about Pilots here
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering whether the language
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
here could be problematic in that it's
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
it's May or it I mean it it sounds like
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
it's accommodating for different
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
situations but
 
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
also sounds like they could pay or not
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
pay so I guess maybe I want some clarity
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
around that if you have it well I'm
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
going to defer that question to folks
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
who are more directly involved with the
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
whole payment and L of taxes situation
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
it is mentioned on line nine of the text
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
that you quoted it says in a payment in
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
Le of taxes pursuant to Etc but um other
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
folks I think would be in better in a
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
better position to answer that question
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you do we have other
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you for taking my
 
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
question referring to the fiscal note
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
dated uh
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
128 on page two I believe you said that
 
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
this was a wash in that the money that's
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
not collected under the utility property
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
taxes will be collected under swep but
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
what I read from this note is this bill
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
keeps swept at the statutory required
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
amount of 363 million
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
and it's goes on to say it will result
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
in a change in the overall Statewide
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation and swept rate they
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
said they can't give us an exact number
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
but it would be an increase in the
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
property tax base to to be equalized
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
would generally increase the Statewide
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
equalized value which is the Dominator
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
and the calculator of the Statewide swep
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
rate and therefore reduces the Statewide
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
swep rate so I read this to say maybe
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong that the we're going to lose
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
um well first year 5.36 million and then
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
over 12 million out of the utility
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
property tax and that money is going to
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
then go into swep but the swep is going
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
to be capped at 363 million so the rate
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
of swep will go down so it's it's
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
lowering the rate but it's not adding
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
more money into it is that correct that
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
is correct and when the bill goes to a
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
second committee I expect that the $363
 
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
million cap will get raised okay and
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
more money will flow into the education
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
trust fund as a result making for a wash
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
however there are other people who will
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
be testifying later who can maybe shed
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
more light on that and it is covered in
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
the findings of the commission report
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
that I referred to earlier followup yeah
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
the the other question I I am I
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying is that
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
the uh generators are no longer owned by
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
utility so they shouldn't be subject to
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
a utility tax they're basically Electric
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing facilities but we do have
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
some utility owned generation either we
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
have B some battery storage and some
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
solar would they still be considered
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
under the utility property
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
tax I believe they would be because they
 
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
are as you point out utility owned so
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
that the property is utility property
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
thank you would it make sense if you
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
pursue um an amendment to add that
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
language that that specificity to this
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
about uh generation that's owned by
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
utilities still remaining under the
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
utility property
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
certainly representative Thomas Wendy
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you um Madam chair um
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday we heard uh and thank you for
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
presenting this and I'm sorry I was late
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
and didn't hear the whole thing but
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday we heard um a bill about um
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
off-grid Power generators do you see
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
this as applying to that group of um
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
generators as
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
well no two separate things thank
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you representative McGee
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
and uh uh thank you Mr chair uh relative
 
00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:51.909 align:start position:0%
and uh uh thank you Mr chair uh relative
to

00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh um the the characterization of the
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
net effect of this uh I kned on a lot of
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
doors this past summer and probably the
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
number one concern was property taxes
 
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.710 align:start position:0%
number one concern was property taxes
and

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh my so I gather being somewhat new to
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
how the utilities are taxed versus you
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
know Gathering funds for swept and so
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are are they currently kind of
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
paying this tax through their utility
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill and this was be shifted to their
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
property tax or is there going to be no
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
owners the swept rate will go down
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat according to the fiscal note
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
that would impact individual local
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
chair representative Harrington you
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just so
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
I get this straight then uh the utility
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
sorry the generating facility would be
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
no longer classified as utility property
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
so it would be taxed just like
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
everything else in the municipality
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's a manufacturing plant a
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
house uh a shopping center so it would
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
be taxed at whatever that rate was now
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
if you would mention that for example
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
seab Brook was being assessed at a
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
billion dollars by the town and a half A
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
Million by the state a half a billion by
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
the state so if that would to stay then
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
the the property taxes that CBR pays
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
would double because it seems to me as
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
if because the town is going to set the
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
assessment is that correct of the value
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
of the property yes towns set those
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
assessments yes so we could but the
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
swept rate the Statewide education
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
property tax rate is set in
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
statute so uh it's variable somewhat
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
variable but right now it's about
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
a120 per thousand
 
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.029 align:start position:0%
a120 per thousand
follow

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
up so I'm I'm just trying to figure you
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
trying to the town will set the
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
assessment which in all likelihood at
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
least in some cases is going to be
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
higher than it would be uh set by the
 
00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.669 align:start position:0%
higher than it would be uh set by the
state

00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to figure out how that's
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
going to affect the generators then are
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
they going to pay higher property taxes
 
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
and will that the fact that they're not
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
paying that they're paying in sweat will
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
that be lower enough to balance those
 
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
two out I'm just trying to figure how
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
the math works if anyone's looked at
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
that yeah so the way municipalities
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
assess these power generators today
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
is the problem they currently assess
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
these generation
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
facilities uh for municipal tax purposes
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
by hiring private assessors and the
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
values that they typically come up with
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
are much higher than the values that the
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
Dr comes up with for utility property
 
00:24:01.679 --> 00:24:02.710 align:start position:0%
Dr comes up with for utility property
tax

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
assessments that leads to
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and one of the ways we believe
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
that we can get rid of those lawsuits or
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
at least reduce them is to remove that
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
tension between these two differing
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
assessments and one way to do that is to
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
exempt these facilities from being
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
assessed by Dr in order to pay the
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
utility property tax now the swept tax
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
as I said has a rate and it's set um it
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
varies a little bit depending on total
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
valuation but uh it's set and it doesn't
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
value that much vary that much and it
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
assessment representative
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you representative McGee
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you chairman Vose um you
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you have some Assurance
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
from from the fiscal committee that that
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
swept cap would be raised but can you
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit more on that
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
Assurance because it seems to me that
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
that is really the crucial element in
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
this given the constraints on our educ
 
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
our public educational system and and
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
the the the lack of willingness to to
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
sort of fund it to to its adequate
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
amount so what kind of assurance can you
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
give us on this committee that that
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
swept rate indeed will be you know
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
levelized or raised to to an adequate
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
amount I can give you no assurance all I
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
can do is say that they will look at
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
that question and decide what to do they
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
could raise the uh the cap or they could
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
say that the existing hundred
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
million uh Surplus in the education
 
00:25:46.389 --> 00:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
trust fund will be adequate to cover any
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
upt shortfall in the education trust
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
fund I can't give you assurances one way
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
or the other what what they will
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
do I'd like to move us along do do you
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
have another
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
question I know the chairman has me in
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
this seat because he has to be somewhere
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
so I just thought there were other
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
people that could maybe answer the
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you so much thank you Mr
 
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
chairman for introducing this bill and I
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
think we're going to move on we have
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
quite a few pink cards and we were
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to set the second hearing right
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
now so um the next speaker is patab
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
bramy who's been working on this for a
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
really long time and hopefully he can
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
answer some questions for us as well
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again Mr abrami thank
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair good being here
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
yes uh P Bry former State Rep P Bry uh
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
I've served 12 years here in the house
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
and all of that time on the Ways and
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
Means Committee I'm going to give you a
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
bit of a history of how we got here um
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
this has to do with assessing of of uh
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
of utility Properties or regulated
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
properties I should say back in 2016 and
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
17 the first to come to bat was was
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
Telecom the Telecom industry felt that
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
their their assessments done by the
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
municipal Assessors for local property
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
taxes were way off and uh we agreed with
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
them that you know they would they would
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
assess One telephone poll in one
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
Community same height same skirth at
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
$200 another Community would take the
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
same poll and and and assess it at
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
$2,000 so uh in that case we didn't have
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
a commission but it came to a
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that I chaired and we came
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
up with a simple straightforward formula
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh that was was foolproof that couldn't
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
be tampered with uh that gave guidance
 
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
to the uh the local um municipalities uh
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
assessors how to assess uh those those
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
assets seeing that the utility
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
distribution companies meaning electric
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
water and
 
00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
gas approached us to say hey we have the
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
same problem so we uh I said okay the
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
best way to handling this is let's let's
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
form a commission on this one and which
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
we did and again the the major issue was
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
something that U I think representative
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
V also talked about was this disparity
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the way the municipalities were
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
assessing these
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
properties and um that that commission
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
did get formed and we had
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
representatives from all the different
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
um uh constituencies on that commission
 
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
which were similar to the ones that we
 
00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:27.799 align:start position:0%
have we had on the the one dealing with
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
this issue and I'll talk about that in a
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
minute so this was around 2018 and we
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
formed that
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
commission and U and the first thing I
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
said to him everybody in the room and
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
again all cons constituencies were there
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities assant
 
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
groups um the um um the the utilities
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
themselves and the D
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
Dr and um the first thing I said is
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
there anybody in this room who doesn't
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a problem to be
 
00:28:57.159 --> 00:28:59.110 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a problem to be
solved

00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
solved
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
and everybody was quiet there was a
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
problem to be solved and in the
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
background we had the Supreme Court of
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court of New Hampshire for
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
40 years saying legislature fix this
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
problem fix this problem because all as
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative all said it was a a
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
volumous number of lawsuits every time
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
assessment was done so again we we
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
worked at this and we we solved it with
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
with uh two simple
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
formulas um and they were foolproof it
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't be
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
manipulated and uh and it was for
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
electric and gas it was a valuation of
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
assets of 70 70% original cost and 20
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
30% net book cost and for water water
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
was different because of some a lot of
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
issues I won't get into those details
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
25% original cost and 75% net cost and
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
in 2019 that bill passed and it's it's
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
so so then they was minding my business
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
and I was approached by the power
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
generation uh Association of of New
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
England and they said you know we have
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
the similar problem assessments
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
are way out of
 
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
control but the other problem they had
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
as representative all said is that when
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
the Dr did it for the Statewide property
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
tax the the the the the Dr assessments
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
were half of what the uh the the
 
00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:34.519 align:start position:0%
municipality assessors were assessing at
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
so again I said okay the best way to do
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
this let's form a commission again and
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
again it had the it had the power
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
generating Community there had the
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
assessing Community it had the
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
muncipalities and the Dr were all in the
 
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.710 align:start position:0%
muncipalities and the Dr were all in the
room

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
together uh and and again we this was
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
goes back three years we had a
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
commission we would the problem we had
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
with this time was that for
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
utilities those assets were homogeneous
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
across towns there wasn't too much
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
variability in terms of how many you
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
know this time by the way when you talk
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
utilities you're talking about electric
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
poles versus for's telephone polls uh
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
understand that sometimes they're owned
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
by both and sometimes one owns it and
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
one owns it and they just share the
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
polls but um so the the
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
the the commission
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
met the problem was that
 
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
um we had heterogeneous uh properties uh
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
or generators we had the ranged from the
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
huge nuclear power plant at seab Brook
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
to the smallest
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
Dam up up north and there were 59 by the
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
way there's about 59 power generators of
 
00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.190 align:start position:0%
way there's about 59 power generators of
variating

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
variating
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
sizes so we ran out of time we we the
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
commission uh a second time but that
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
came out of came out of legislative
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
service so late that we only had about
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh five meetings worth and at the end of
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
that meeting uh we still hadn't come up
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
with a solution because of the the
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
differing sizes of these plants and it's
 
00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
very hard to come up with a simple
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
formula the idea was surfaced that why
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
don't we why don't we just say that you
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
know they said we're not we're not
 
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
utilities anymore after that the law
 
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.470 align:start position:0%
utilities anymore after that the law
changed

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
when power generators aren't utilities
 
00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
they are not regulated they are not
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
regulated um uh utilities anymore so we
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
should be treated as representative V
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
said like any other
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
business so we took up that up again and
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
those first two commissions I chaired
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
third commission came last year uh and
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
our starting point was that that
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
discussion and uh I was at the time
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
chairing another commission and we
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
decided represent a v
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
um take a whack at this and and each
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
chair this
 
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
uh so we couldn't come up with the stord
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
so so we again we had all the right
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
people in the room and we went around
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
and around and if you you look at the
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
report you can see all the different
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
things that we had
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
discussed um and we did come to a
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
conclusion that that yes maybe the the
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
solution is that they aren't really
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
utilities anymore and that we should
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
pull them out so that would solve the
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
problem of the assessing and all the
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
court cases and all of
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
that and then and then representative
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
Vos did mention that the swep tax was
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
involved in this and all of that and and
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
I talked about the pilots as well so we
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
we came to a consensus in this
 
00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
commission and uh there was really two
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
things that that were firm
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations one that utility should
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
not be uh I mean the power generary
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
should not be taxed under the uh utility
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
property tax and that the pilot should
 
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
be honored there were other
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were not as firm
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
that it was up to the legislature if
 
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
they wanted to take those
 
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.470 align:start position:0%
they wanted to take those
up

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
so so I think the question for this uh
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
committee is the policy uh I know there
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
were a lot of questions about about the
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
math and about the money uh my
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this is a a two
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee Bill it'll probably be going
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
to ways and means to be addressing that
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
I think the big question that in front
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
is should are the power generators
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
utilities or
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
not uh so I I'll leave it at that I know
 
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of others who want to
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
speak on this including people from
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
power generation people and we have the
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
Dr here and I would suggest uh that you
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
hold the questions on U on some of the
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
math to the de
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
who who help with the
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
math thank you honorable Patrick arami
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
for being here and testifying on this
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
bill questions for Mr abami
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
chair um this question goes out to you
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
because you're a former representative
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
um we heard from the prime sponsor that
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
the swept rate would go down and it
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
would impact local property taxes um how
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
as a former representative can you help
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
me justify this to any constituents who
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
are already suffering from astronomical
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
property taxes again I I I would suggest
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
the the person who did all the math is
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
sitting behind us here and uh when when
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
if the Dr you should ask him to to come
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
up and and discuss that thank you very
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
you okay further questions for Mr AB
 
00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.349 align:start position:0%
you okay further questions for Mr AB
Robin

00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
Robin
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move along thank you
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I'll ask next for the
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to give us their
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation and call
 
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
up Megan
 
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.950 align:start position:0%
up Megan
[Music]

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
Stone good morning Miss Stone good to
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
again good morning Mr chair and members
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee um the department is
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill as um electric
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
generators are not uh regulated by the
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
department uh we have no problem with
 
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.670 align:start position:0%
department uh we have no problem with
the

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
language that's all I have okay thank
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
you short and sweet we like it no
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss Stone next we'll call
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
up m Molly Connors of the New England
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
power gener generators
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
Association Miss Connors was a member of
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
the commission and contributed
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
invaluable uh input to the commission's
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
work and Report thank you good morning
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
um it's nice to see you all again less
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
than like 18 hours later um for the
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
record I'm Molly Connors I'm with the
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
New England power generators Association
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
we do represent the non-utility owned
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
power generating facilities in the
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
region and in New Hampshire um that
 
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
means they own and operate about 4,300
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
megawatts of power generating capacity
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire that means about um
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
1,500 employees uh throughout the state
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
and uh countless Millions paid in state
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
and local taxes um I don't want to I
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
will I will try not to be duplic ative
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
in what people have already said but we
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
do want to emphasize that our members
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
are not economically regulated by the
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
state Public Utility Commission and we
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
really do view them as manufacturing
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
facilities they are taking a product and
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
they are converting it into a commodity
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
in this case megawatt hours um but right
 
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
now they're being charged property taxes
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
as if they have guaranteed cost recovery
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
just like their utilities so um this has
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
turned into a costly inefficient unfair
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
situation that does contribute to
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
increased litigation costs for host
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
communities for the power generators and
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire itself
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
and so um I I just want to share a
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
little bit about how we got to this
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
place historically up until the late 90s
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire the late 90s and
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
the mid 2000s um New Hampshire's
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
utilities did own the power plants state
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
law state policy has changed that so
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
that now they're out from under the
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
utilities but utilities can take their
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
property tax and pass that cost directly
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
onto rate payers and be guaranteed that
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to get that cost recovery
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
my members the power generators do not
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
have that Financial option instead they
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
are competing against one another and
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
against power plants across the region
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
in order to sell their megawatts into a
 
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
market and that's how they recover their
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
property costs and their property tax
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
costs and so what we've um what has
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
what's resulted in this in addition to
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
everything that's already been touched
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
on is that the power plants are paying
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
two different property taxes they're and
 
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
because of that they're undergoing two
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
distinct assessments they go through an
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
assessment at the municipal level and
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
they go through an assessment at the
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
state level done by the Department of
 
00:39:17.599 --> 00:39:18.470 align:start position:0%
state level done by the Department of
Revenue

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
Administration um this is in contrast to
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
every other commercial entity in the
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
state which only underg goes one point
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
of assessment and that means that the
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
power generators when they go through
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
their assessments if they have to
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
challenge one they go through two
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
separate processes they have to go
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
through if if they want to challenge the
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
state assessment they need to go through
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
one process for that which means two
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
sets of abatements two sets of appeals
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
and if they need to challenge the
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
assessment at the local level they have
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
to go through a separate process for
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
that and so they're going through two
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
sets of appeals two sets of abatements
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
there is no other commercial entity in
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
the state that undergos this and New
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state in the
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
country that subjects new the power
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
plants to two separate assessments and
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
all of the administrative burdens that
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
come with that and this is all because
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
it is a remnant of tax taxation because
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
utilities used to own the power plants
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
and utilities could just recover the
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
cost directly really tax policy just
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be caught up a little bit with
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
the energy
 
00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
policy and so the solution in front of
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
you with 696 is really a consensus based
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
one and it's been years in the making as
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative abami and
 
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative V already said there is a
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
commission established three years in a
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
row that met and in the at the
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the third year after hours
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
of testimony and um the the commission
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
recommended that generators should no
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
longer pay the utility property tax and
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
instead pay the Statewide education
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
property tax that is the tax that every
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
other commercial entity in the state is
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
paying as well as every other
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
residential property owner um doing so
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
would put generators in the appropriate
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate category of every other
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprise it takes the
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue out of the
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
business entirely of assessing power
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
plants and it would keep control of
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
assessing in the hands of local mun
 
00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.309 align:start position:0%
assessing in the hands of local mun
local

00:41:15.309 --> 00:41:15.319 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and I think as we me
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's um mentioned in the report that um
 
00:41:22.109 --> 00:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose already shared with you
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
and mentioned in my testimony power
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
generators are required to comply with
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
extensive regul ations and extensive
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements and so in the
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
testimony that I I passed out earlier um
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
there is an addendum at the back this is
 
00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
information that is also in the report
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
that the property tax commission went
 
00:41:43.309 --> 00:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
through but at the very um back of my um
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
present of my my written testimony you
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
can see the different types of
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
information regarding um pricing um
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
operations um in the wholesale markets
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
there is extensive information that's
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
available to the public that um
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
generators are ultimately responsible
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
for providing that should be able to
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
give you a sense of how a given power
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
plant is doing um and so unlike other
 
00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprises power generators
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
are actually providing tremendous
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
information tremendous amounts of
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
information uh to the public regarding
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
their business operations um that
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
actually sets them apart for many other
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh many other commercial entities and so
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately our bottom line is this bill
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
is a narrow consensus
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
Common Sense series of recommendations
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
and we encourage you to um to to adopt
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
this because to us this is just a common
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
sense compromise solution um and I just
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
I do want to be responsive to a few of
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up earlier um
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
regarding representative McGee's
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
question on the definitions of who um
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
you asked will utility owned power
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
generating facilities be able to be
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
Exempted from this tax um do we need an
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment the definition that we that we
 
00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
chose in the bill or that we recommended
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
um that the it is written in such a way
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
that utility owned generation would not
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
be Exempted if utility owns generation
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
roughly this is roughly line 22 and 23
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill second page um the
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
definitions there that we cite do not
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
include utilities and so I don't I mean
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
we can look we're obviously open to
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I don't think an amendment
 
00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
is is anticipated because we didn't we
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want to you know we didn't want
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
to include the utility owned generators
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
because they can include that property
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
tax rate directly in rates and frankly
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
there aren't that many power plants in
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
the state that are directly owned by
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
utilities I can think of a solar array
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
owned by one but really the vast
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the plants are are living
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
and dying in the wholesale markets and I
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
want to also emphasize you know there
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
were some very understandable and valid
 
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
questions regarding impacts to local
 
00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
local property taxes and one thing that
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
we were very mindful to do it was one of
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendations was not
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
have this change in law take effect
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
until after the state budget that is
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
currently under consideration is passed
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't want this to be caught up you
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
know and we want whatever the basically
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
whatever is applying to every other
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
business is what we want to apply to our
 
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
power plants and so we knew that you
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
know this could impact the budget in
 
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
some way so we purposely said the
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
effective date should be after this bium
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
and as you consider this I know that
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
you're the jurisdictional committee
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
regarding energy but what you can think
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
of it is is um it's like a large
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
business is coming into your town and
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
what does that mean for your local
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
property base right now everyone who
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
pays the the towns that do swept all of
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
them power plants are not included in in
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
the in this in the swept right now
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're only included in the utility
 
00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
property tax so right now when a town um
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
when they're overall valuation is done
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
the value of a power plant is not
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
included in that this change would mean
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
that the power plants are like any other
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
business in your community they're part
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
of the overall valuation when it comes
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the property taxes so I hope that's
 
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
responsive and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions questions from Miss Connor
 
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.710 align:start position:0%
questions questions from Miss Connor
representative

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair so in your
 
00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
testimony on the second page towards the
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
bottom you make a comment that no
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire is required to
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
provide sensitive commercial information
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
to municipalities for the purpose of
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
property tax assessment and that the
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
commission went on had an extensive
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
discussion about practices in
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine uh and whether
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should be changing its
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
property tax laws can you elaborate on
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
what all that extensive discussion
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
is there is the desire I think an
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
understandable one when an entity is
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with a fair market
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
value of a property because what does an
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
assessor do when they're assessing your
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
property what is the fair market value
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I think there is the desire for more
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
and more and more information because
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
the more information you have about a
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
given property presumably the more
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
accurate your information might be but
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
there right now in New Hampshire law are
 
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
limits to what the government can ask a
 
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
private entity what's appropriate and
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
not appropriate and so the commission
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
discussed how you balance the desire of
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
a local government government to have
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
access to information for the purpose of
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
Taxation versus the right of a private
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
entity in a very competitive market
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
business that have razor th margins and
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
high stakes that they don't want their
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
information being shared with local
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
government that's subject to 91a and we
 
00:46:46.349 --> 00:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
know the municipalities are often
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
underst staffed and so they have a lot
 
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
of responsibilities we're very
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
protective of that information and we're
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
very protective of that maybe being
 
00:46:56.589 --> 00:46:56.599 align:start position:0%
shared um and so it's very sensitive
 
00:46:59.230 --> 00:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
information and so on the one hand this
 
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
the representative state government
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
wanted access to information that's
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
proprietary and on the other hand the
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
business entities that are being
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
taxed believe that it is in inherent to
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
their ability to compete to keep that
 
00:47:11.359 --> 00:47:13.270 align:start position:0%
their ability to compete to keep that
information

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.829 align:start position:0%
information
private

00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
followup is there something unique about
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
Maine and Massachusetts distinct from
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that caused uh a
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
controversy here well the expertise and
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
I you know I don't I can speak to power
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
plants more but there was a lot of
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
expertise and a variety of different
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
points of view on that commission and so
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
some of the assessors in New Hampshire
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
also do Assessments in other states and
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
so they say well we in Maine have access
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
to this information and in Massachusetts
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
every taxpayer has to give over this
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
information New Hampshire you know New
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should follow suit to Maine
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire I mean I'm sorry to
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
Maine and massachusett we have access to
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
this vation in other states but as was
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
also pointed out in those other states
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
every single property taxpayer has to
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
share that information not just power
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
plants and so we held that that's a much
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
larger conversation than what that
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
commission was asked to look at whether
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
or not you're going to subject every
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
business in this state to certain sorts
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
of information requirements is a very
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
much larger
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you thank you
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Harington has a question
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for Tak my question
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just I want to make sure I have this
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
right so let me just walk through what I
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
think I'm hearing on this so we're
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
starting out with the utility property
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
tax for generators of electricity is
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to go away so they will not be
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
paying 5.36 million into the education
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund uh the first year and then
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
almost 13 million subsequent years
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
following that so the cap on swept
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
though would stay in effect so they be
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
paying the swept rate and since they're
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
adding more value to to the total
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
property the swept rate would go down so
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
the generators would
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
pay a swept rate instead of the utility
 
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
property tax but they'd still pay the
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
same local property tax so is this new
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
swept rate going to be lower for the
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
util utility generators or is it going
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
to be higher than under the utility
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
property tax so I um let me uh to be
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
responsive first off what I think you
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
caught yourself at the end the utility
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
property tax is not going away it's
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
still going to apply to ever source and
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
Liberty and every other utility it's
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
just the generators of that um and that
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
will no longer be applied um I think to
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
answer your question I think you would
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
have to do that holding everything equal
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
annoying statement um because we know
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
that property valuations change every
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
year and that state law could change and
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
so if state law doesn't change then yes
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
um the we anticipate that local property
 
00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
rates would go down because the over for
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
the host communities would probably go
 
00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
down because the overall value of the of
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
the property in the community is going
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
up and so everyone's share of what they
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
need to pay is going down so
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
theoretically holding everything equal
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
assuming there's no other changes in law
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah we anticipate that that the rate
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
would go down follow up follow up but I
 
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
I don't want to overpromise I I just I'm
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
still still trying to get this s you
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
you're saying two different things there
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like separate issues one the
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
swept rate would probably go down
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
because you're adding more money to it
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore every taxpayer in the town
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
would save by having a lower swep rate
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
whether they had anything to do with
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
power plant or not but you also said
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
that the overall property tax would go
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
up so you expect the assessments to go
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
up when this happens and why would that
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
be let me this is how I understand
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
it right now when the utility the
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
generators are paying the upt m and the
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
local taxes
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
right your utility property tax goes
 
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
proceeds go into the education trust
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
fund the overall value of that in a
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
given year is a billion plus
 
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.109 align:start position:0%
given year is a billion plus
dollars

00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
separately property taxes are being paid
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
locally everyone else is every other
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
business is paying the Statewide
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
education property tax and that is
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
administered differently there's a cap
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
in statute that's been there for many
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
years 363 million and so um there are in
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
in Adam's noncore sorry to call you out
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
Adam but Dr is also here so they might
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
do a better job at explaining this but
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
the power plants um I'm sorry the
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax is set
 
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
in statute and Dr handles the valuations
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
and all of the calculations that get
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
handed down in terms of what the rate
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
should be for every community and so
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
when Dr does these calculations the
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
power plant will be part of those
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
calculations whereas right now they're
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
not part of the calculations at
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
all we do have a pink card here from Dr
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
so they will be
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
testifying representative Wendy Thomas
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
being here um the answer to this
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
question may be in your testimony but I
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
have finally reached the age where I
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
can't read these tiny tiny graphs sorry
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
um can you tell me what is the bottom
 
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
line monetarily that we're talking about
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
the difference um between what they're
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
paying now and what they would pay after
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed if this bill is
 
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.950 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed if this bill is
passed

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
um the bottom line is the generators
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
will be taxed like every other
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
commercial entity in the state and that
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
the bottom line for their taxes will
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
depend on what they're assessed at and
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
then what the tax rate will be and so
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
we've known here's the challenge there's
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
such a different um there's such a wide
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
range in the values that are assessed to
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
the power plants that it can be very
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
hard to predict and also state law could
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
change we know that that's always um an
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
issue that's hovering over this
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
legislature is um the issues of school
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
funding um however we we know that the
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
local assessments are likely to be
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than what the state
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
assessments have been however we also
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
know that this the rate for swept is
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
lower than the rate for the upt I have
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
to say though that and so that I think
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
and not a number that we could say
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what we do know and what has
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
been a priority for us is that half of
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
the administrative burden will go away
 
00:53:39.789 --> 00:53:39.799 align:start position:0%
and half of the risk of lawsuits will go
 
00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
away be because the it is especially if
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
you are a a power plant that owns
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
multiple properties consider some of our
 
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
native hydros they they are in multiple
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
communities sometimes they cross
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
different states they have to comply
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
with information requests from every
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
single town that they're in plus they
 
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
have to do all of the the burden for the
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
then they have to deal with um whether
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
or not those those are fair the
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
assessments are fair and so we know at
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
the very least the administrative burden
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
will be lessened the tax bill is another
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr conis for being here and
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
enlightening us as you always do um my
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
question I I think to follow on uh
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas's
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
question I think what I'm trying to
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
understand is I agree that it is fair
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
for you not to be paying the utility
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
property tax what I what I would like to
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
know is whether you can tell me the
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
amount of utility property tax that will
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
no longer be going into the coffers for
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
the E the education trust fund so I I
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
will refer for the most current year I
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
would refer to the fiscal note for the
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
year that I prepared when we were doing
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
the the commission because I also served
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
on that commission for three years I was
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
a member officially for one but I
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
attended every single commission meeting
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
so we got to know this issue quite well
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
um in the past give or take the overall
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
value of the education trust fund is $1
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
billion sometimes a little more
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes a little less but it's been
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
consistent in that
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
regard within that you have you know the
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax the business
 
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:21.160 align:start position:0%
profits tax all you know the cigarettes
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
um the the alcohol all of that goes into
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund within that 1
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
something billion dollar with all of
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
those different sources of revenue the
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
utility property tax was again give or
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
take $40
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
million and of that the util the
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
generator portion is somewhere around
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
$10 million so the overall impact to the
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
education trust fund would be less than
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
1% thank you that's really helpful
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
yeah further
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none want to thank you
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
Miss honors very good testimony and ask
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
now the Dr and Adam denore to come speak
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
with us because we know that Adam's
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
going to help us clear up some of these
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
questions about the numbers and the math
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here Adam Adam was
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
also a member of the commission I was my
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
name is Adam denor I'm the assistant
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
director of the municipal and property
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
division at the Department of Revenue
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
Administration uh we don't have a
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
position on this legislation but I'm
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.069 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
may

00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
have questions for Mr denan cor
 
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:33.640 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here um so uh
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the the the policy pieces of
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
the bill in terms of whether or not
 
00:56:45.309 --> 00:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
these generators should continue paying
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
as though they are the regulated
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
utilities I think is clear amongst us
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
all the on the money piece um we also
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
have as a
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
legislature the other problem which
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
which is that we've been told we need to
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
have more money for education and seeing
 
00:57:05.069 --> 00:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund go down
 
00:57:05.079 --> 00:57:06.670 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund go down
um

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
is it would be of concern so can I ask
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
you what how the department is is um
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
looking at what's coming
 
00:57:16.799 --> 00:57:18.990 align:start position:0%
looking at what's coming
in

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh or changes to what's coming in uh in
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
terms of how we're going to be paying
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
the bills that we have in terms of
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
obligations around education um I
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
because I think the education trust fund
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
if the if the education trust fund goes
 
00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
down then property taxpayers are going
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
to pick up an additional um piece is
 
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.510 align:start position:0%
to pick up an additional um piece is
that

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
correct I don't know that that's
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily true I think that the
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
complicated part of this is the way that
 
00:57:47.789 --> 00:57:47.799 align:start position:0%
swept interacts with adequacy in upt and
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
I and I can't really dip into the
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
adequacy part of it because I'm not from
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
education I don't know enough um but in
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
terms of uh upt and swept I think has
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
been mentioned a couple of times by
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
expanding the swept tax base in this way
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
you do ultimately reduce the swept rate
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
which means that pretty much every other
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer in the state pays a
 
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
little bit less in tax because there are
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
a few new big property taxpayers on the
 
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
Block um in terms of the way that you
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
know the the reduction in Revenue I
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
think the fiscal note notes 5.36 million
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
in the first year that reduction how
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
that ends up coming out through adequacy
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
is difficult for me to speak to just
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
because of the the mechanism involved
 
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
and Dr doesn't really get into that
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily but there is certainly a
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
reduction on the upt side um but there's
 
00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
an increase or I should say increase in
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
the tax base on the swep side so does
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
that balance itself out it's hard to say
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
without knowing the adequacy part of it
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
well enough to speak to
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
it yes followup yes so the followup
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
would be um one thing that I know
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's a a new fiscal note that we've
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
all looked at but uh my question would
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
be then
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
around uh the cap uh that's currently on
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
the swept portion um would it be true
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
that that cap would have to be increased
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
in order for us to um accommodate the
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
new funding that would be coming in
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
from uh property tax assessments that
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
would be on these generating
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
facilities as I understand
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
swept revenue is considered a it is
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
considered ETF Revenue so then we
 
00:59:36.270 --> 00:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
discussed this in um as part of the
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
commission whether or not there needed
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
to be a balance on the other side by
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
increasing the swept cap um I would
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
expect that that would have a on on
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
effect additional questions
 
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.910 align:start position:0%
effect additional questions
representative

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you chairman thank you
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just uh
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get again make sure we got
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
this straight so we're going to reduce
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
the uh education trust fund uh
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
contributions because the utility the
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
generators are no longer classified as
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
utilities so they don't pay the utility
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
property tax they are going to be
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
spaying spending money sending that
 
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
money into the swept and that will
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
increase the property size base of swep
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
so it would lower the swept rate
 
01:00:24.029 --> 01:00:24.039 align:start position:0%
provided that cap stays in place for all
 
01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers across the state is
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct okay and
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so I think what it
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
comes down to then
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
is we that swept rate is going to be
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
applied against the assessed value of
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
the power plant as set by the local
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
Authority is that correct that's right
 
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
okay so okay one assessment only thank
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
you yep just one single
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
assessment okay additional
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
questions representative m thank you Mr
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
chairman and um this is just sort of an
 
01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
afterthought because you guys do
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
assessing around this stuff and the
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
conversation that came up around um the
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
requests for additional information
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
potentially from municipalities on
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
generators that is not like any other
 
01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
business or
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer um and can you illuminate
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
for us what kind of information that
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
would be because I would think a
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
property tax assessment I know ours is
 
01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
based on the valuation of the property
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
and not related to the success of the
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
business so I I wanted to just try and
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
understand what it is the additional
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
information would be that would be
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
requested from these folks so that we
 
01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
can be clear you know how we're
 
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
implementing this sure um depending on
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
the type of property in this case um
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
let's just say a dam for example it's
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to separate the um incom
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
producing ability of that property from
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
its ultimate value so with a residential
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
home that really doesn't apply at all um
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
even if you're talking about something
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
that you could possibly list on Airbnb
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't really begin to enter
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
into the discussion about the market
 
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
value of the property where where the
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
dam for example its sole purpose is to
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
generate electricity and produce money
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
for its owner um so in those cases it is
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate to review the capacity of
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
that um property to generate income
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
because that's directly going to be how
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
it's marketed if it were sold um so that
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
case you would need some information to
 
01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:29.799 align:start position:0%
assist you as you developed an appraisal
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
on that on that basis and followup
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
followup do you agree with Miss Connor's
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
that there is um adequate uh public
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
information currently on the businesses
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
and the uh generation capabilities of
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
these properties in the public
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
domain that's difficult for me to say we
 
01:02:54.269 --> 01:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
have the advantage of receiving all of
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
the non-public information um in order
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
to produce our assessment um but I I so
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
I can't say that I've reviewed what's
 
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
available publicly other than just the
 
01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Comm that's fair
 
01:03:04.599 --> 01:03:06.349 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Comm that's fair
thank

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington yeah just
 
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
just a follow up on what was just stated
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
there you you were saying that in in
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
case of a dam
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh the value of its product is so
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh important to the price of its if it
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
was be sold but how does that differ
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
let's just say we have two restaurants
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
in a town and one seems used to be doing
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
very very busy because there's always
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
cars in the parking lot and the other
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
one very not very busy but they have the
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
same basic uh footprint the pretty much
 
01:03:39.309 --> 01:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
the same location uh so if someone is
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
assessing the values of those products
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
would they go in and say well this
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant makes a lot of seems like
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's making a lot of money I don't know
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
for a fact because I can't review the
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
books but I see all those cars in the
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
parking lot so we're going to charge
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to assess them higher than
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
the one over here whose parking lot's
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
mostly empty is that the way it's done
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
it it may not be a appropriate to use
 
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
what they would call the income approach
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
to value in in the case of a restaurant
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
I we're talking probably about the
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
underlying real estate what the what it
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
would be worth to rent that um if it if
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
it was a case where you know uh one
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant was positioned on the corner
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
of two busy streets and that caused
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
increased traffic you can expect that
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
the owner of the property would charge
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
more in rent that but that would have
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
less to do the with the quality
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
operation of the business than with the
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
value of the underlying real estate
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
followup followup it would seem to me
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
that that same logic would apply then to
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
a generator as well uh because if you
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
don't if you you're not saying how much
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
they make counts it's location location
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
location if you will and um the you're
 
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
talking about the two restaurants let's
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
just say they were in similar locations
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
obviously if one is right off the exit
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
of an interstate and the other one's on
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
a dirt road five miles out in the
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
country that's going to have a direct
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
value on a direct impact on their value
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
but how much they actually sell the
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
accessor wouldn't even wouldn't be aware
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
of they he has no access to their books
 
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
does he not not at the not at the moment
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
no no and it's a fair point I I think
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
that ultimately what it comes down to is
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
is is that structure that the
 
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:08.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant's operating out of capable of
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
being used for other things and in the
 
01:05:11.789 --> 01:05:11.799 align:start position:0%
case of a dam or something like that
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's like I said it's more difficult to
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
separate the operation of that business
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
considering you know you don't want to
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
no one's going to live in the dam um you
 
01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
know the only reason why it would ever
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
exist is for the purpose of generating
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
electricity and and you know creating
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
capital and one quick followup okay okay
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
um you had said that U you have access
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
to certain uh sensitive nonpublic
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
information that's when uh your agency
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
was you're determining the value for the
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
property uh for the purpose of the
 
01:05:42.549 --> 01:05:42.559 align:start position:0%
utility property tax so you have
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
accessed to information that the local
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
assessor doesn't and now we're going to
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
go to a situation where the only one
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
setting the assessment is going to be
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
the local assessor without access to
 
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
this additional information do you think
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
that constitutes problem and maybe in
 
01:05:59.309 --> 01:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
the case of electric generating
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
facilities that the Dr should still be
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
setting the value and then giving that
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the town and saying this is what you
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
can charge on because you have prived so
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
much more information so right now we
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
produce a um we'll produce we actually
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
publicly make our appraisals publicly
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
available and in cases where a generator
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
is let's say uh plac in in one
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
individual municipality will actually
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
report out what our value on that
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
generator is and municipalities have the
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use our value now um most
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
elect not to excuse me I don't want to
 
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
be pay in the neck here Mr chair but
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
just one quick followup but you're
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
saying under this bill if it passes you
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
will no longer be doing that assessment
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that's correct at at the
 
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
current moment most municipalities
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
choose not to use our assessments they
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to right now and
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
for coming in I mean that representative
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
harington's question does lead to the
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
obvious next question which is the you
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
know do how can we be assured that the
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
risk of litigation will be lowered and
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
that the administrative cost will be
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
lowered for these generators if every
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities is doing it in a
 
01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
different way and they're not choosing
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
as you said to use your your
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
appraisals yeah that's a good question
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
um like I said at this moment they're
 
01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
they are actively electing to go that
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
way to go away from just using our
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
appraisal our appraisal is free um and
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
instead they elect to hire an expert to
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
do it um I would say that one one thing
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
that is a fact is that in the past our
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
appraisal has been used directly against
 
01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
the municipal appraisal to spawn an
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
appeal so in that particular case um we
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a taxpayer using the two
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
appraisals to create litigation I think
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things we're that this
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
bill intends to
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
resolve represent un native follow up
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean just just a quick quick
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
point I mean I'm not I'm not sure you
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
can really answer this but okay I take
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
your point about not having the two
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
appraisals which might lead to
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
litigation but how how how we how can
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
our municipalities be assured that
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
they're receiving value for uh you know
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
that they're actually getting adequate
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
information in order to make their
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
assessments uh that's a good question I
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
I would whoever they're intending to
 
01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
contract with to perform the work um
 
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
should certainly give them an idea of
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
how they plan to accomplish the ask and
 
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not they have the information
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
necessary and if they don't they you
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
know they shouldn't take the assignment
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
but at the current moment I don't think
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
that municipalities have a difficult
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
time finding someone to to produce
 
01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
appraisals I would suggest to all
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee that your curiosity about this
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
question can be satisfied by reading the
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
40 to 50 pages of material accumulated
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
in the commission
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
report the findings and the minutes of
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
every single one of our meetings is part
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
report you can read the minutes and see
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
the discussions that we had that sort of
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
mirror the questions I'm hearing here
 
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
we've already asked those questions and
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
answered them all that information is in
 
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.749 align:start position:0%
answered them all that information is in
the

01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
report that's why I sent it had it sent
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
to each of you yesterday so that you
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
would see this this information has
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
already been discussed and these
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
questions have
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
been answered to at least the
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
commission's satisfaction representative
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
you uh I'm sorry I came in late um but I
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand what
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
the impact on the education trust fund
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
is going to be uh we see that the
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
revenue will decrease because of less
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
going into the upt and swept at this
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
point as being kept at the same amount
 
01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the uh the income
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund is
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
actually going to be decreasing so I I
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
believe they'll that's correct um and I
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
think that as Molly has just said it was
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
ETF once again that subject is covered
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
extensively in the commission report the
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Education who was not here
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
this morning to testify was member of
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
the um attended a couple of the
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
commission meetings and answered
 
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
questions about the effect on the
 
01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund by this change
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
and without having the report right in
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
front of me as I recall the Department
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
of Education indicated that the impact
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
was minimal on the education trust fund
 
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.470 align:start position:0%
was minimal on the education trust fund
additional

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none let's
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
bring up mateline Mano next from the
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
hydro Granite State hydrop power ass
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
Association M Mano also was a member of
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
this commission
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
you microphone sorry I didn't know it
 
01:11:07.709 --> 01:11:07.719 align:start position:0%
was turned off uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'm M Mino representing the grand State
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
hydrop Power Association and I
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
represented gsh on the study commission
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
for the past three years um as this is
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
the product of the study commission we
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
support this bill um gsha is
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
complimentary to NEPA where they
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
represent the larger uh
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
generators we represent smaller hydr
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
power producers many of our members use
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
Pilots payment in lie of taxes and we
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that this bill specifically
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
includes language to transition existing
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
pilot agreements so that there's not a
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
significant change in the middle of a
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
pilot agreement pilot Agreements are a
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
contract between the taxpayer and the
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
municipality um and so when those
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
agreements were entered into
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
the generator may have been paying the
 
01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
utility property tax and not the swept
 
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
so we didn't want to upend existing
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
agreements so we appreciate that they um
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
is a transition as well as the specific
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
language on lines 11 to 15 which allows
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
the municipality that have entered into
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
pilot agreements with a generator to use
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
a value calculated from those pilot
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
payments by the Dr to determine the
 
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
amount of swept to be that is owed which
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
would avoid having to do an assessment
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
just specifically for that swept part
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
payment um representative McGee you
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
asked about the fact that the there's
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
language in here saying the swept may be
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
included in a pilot or paid in addition
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
to a pilot payment that's because Pilots
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
are structured in all different ways and
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to give that flexibility to
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer and the municipality to
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
negotiate those new pilots in a way that
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
made sense to both of them so the the
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer could pay a pilot payment and
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
the municipality takes the swept out of
 
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
that payment and transfers that or the
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer could make a pilot payment and
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
then separately make the swept payment
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the municipality because of how the
 
01:13:11.229 --> 01:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
pilot is structured it may make sense to
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
have one whole amount and then take the
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
swept out or it may make sense to pay
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
the pilot and then have the swept
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
assessed separately so we just wanted to
 
01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that that flexibility was
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
still there for the municipalities and
 
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers negotiating Pilots
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
um as has been mentioned before if there
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
is any request to add uh reporting
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
requirements we would oppose that um
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
that was extensively discussed by the
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
study commission and there was no
 
01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
agreement among the commission members
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
so um our position is that if other
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
businesses are not having to open their
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
books to assessors um we shouldn't have
 
01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.229 align:start position:0%
books to assessors um we shouldn't have
to

01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
either um there's been a lot of
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
questions as to what's going to be the
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
effect on us as taxpayers and taxpayers
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
in general so I'll try and just say
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
quickly for generators as taxpayers
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
switching from the upt to paying the
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
swept the rate is much lower but as a
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
rule the local assessment is much higher
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
so how that's going to play out for
 
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
individual generator taxpayers is a
 
01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
little bit hard to say but it's not
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a massive change because
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
you're paying a lower rate on a higher
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
value so it's going to be probably
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar but for individual ual
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
generator taxpayer it might be a little
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
bit more it might be a little bit less
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
and then as far as taxpayers as a whole
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
if you don't change the total amount of
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
swept raised it's going to lower the
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
swept rate that all taxpayers pay so
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a little bit less taxes
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
for everybody else um and I do want to
 
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
just put out there that there's a
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
similar Senate Bill uh Senate Bill
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
277 which is sponsored by Senator Lang
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
and so at some point there's going to
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
have to be a a Reconciliation of these
 
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
two bills which are effectively trying
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
to achieve the same goal I'm happy to
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions for M
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
Mano representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
you I'm just verifying the name of the
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 277 thank you
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Lang was on the commission
 
01:15:15.719 --> 01:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Lang was on the commission
as

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
well it was a big commission it was a
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
big commission uh representative
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
for being here uh this question probably
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
applies to everybody but uh
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
nashwa assessments occur every two three
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
four five
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
years uh and uh so it I'm wondering it
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
feels like there would be a lag between
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
when you know perhaps uh the communities
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
nearby uh your installations this might
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
apply to the other producers will there
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
be a lag between when this goes into
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
effect and when a new assessment might
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
be made and the cor lary to that
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
question is during that interum will be
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
that there a net Improvement of your
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
bottom line due to having gotten rid of
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
this tax for that
 
01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
interim um as I mentioned many of our
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
facilities use payment in Le of taxes
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's a negotiated amount so
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
some of the municipalities have a value
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
on the books and some do not and so
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's why we wanted to have the option
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
to have the municipality use an inferred
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
value based on pilot payments so that's
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
an option for the
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
municipality um as far as the frequency
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
of assessment that's up to the host
 
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
municipality I don't think that the
 
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has any control over that
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah so well but the uh followup
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
followup uh the the question at hand is
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
Will in the interim will there be an
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
immediate Improvement to your bottom
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
line I don't I don't think so because
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
that Municipal assessment tends to be
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
much higher than the dr's assessment
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the study commission found
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
we looked at the Dr assessment and the
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
ms1 assessment for all of the generating
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
facilities and you know sometimes it's
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
as much as as double and so no I don't I
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
don't I guess I I'm not totally
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
understanding your question as far as
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
the frequency of the municipal
 
01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
assessment and a change in in our bottom
 
01:17:28.350 --> 01:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
line as I said when you're changing from
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
paying the utility property tax based on
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
a Dr value at a set rate of 660 per
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
thousand and now you're going to be
 
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
paying the swept on a municipal value
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
which tends to be much higher but the
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
swept has a lower rate it's going to not
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
be a a massive tax break if that's what
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
you're thinking thank you
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.110 --> 01:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chair I I'll try to be brief
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
um knowing this is going to be uh
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
probably uh need to be reconciled with
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill there were several
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations made at the end of the
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
report that uh chair V submitted um
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
could you see those recommendations
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
being addressed at that time or do you
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
see a more urgency for some of those
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh do I need to go over
 
01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
them no several of the the
 
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations to be considered were
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
things that the commission could not
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
agree on and so the specific I think
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is an outcome of what was
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
unanimously agreed upon by the
 
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
commission members a lot of things that
 
01:18:34.990 --> 01:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
said well you know you may want to
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
consider these things were were put in
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
as considerations because the commission
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
members could not generally agree on
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
them and so I I would have I think I
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
would have to look at specific
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
considerations to tell you whether or
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
not I think they should be considered or
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
not but for example reporting
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
requirements are something we would not
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
support adding which I believe was was
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.629 --> 01:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
considerations okay seeing no further
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions we'll give the last word on
 
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation to Brody dues who is
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
Association first of all let's say
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
congratulations on your new position
 
01:19:18.669 --> 01:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I appreciate
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
welome to Chairman and um thank you to
 
01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
the committee for taking my testimony I
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
did write to you some testimony last
 
01:19:26.430 --> 01:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
night tonight I've been Fielding a many
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
calls from Municipal assessors over the
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
last uh few days with concern over this
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
legislation we are neutral the municipal
 
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
Association so let me be clear we're not
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
in opposition we are here to provide
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
some education and to raise some of our
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
concerns and our concerns is about the
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
lack of reporting requirements and um
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's for the same kind of Reason not the
 
01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
same reason it's for some of the reasons
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
in the testimony you heard from Adam
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
from Dr where it's difficult to separate
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
incom producing property um from the
 
01:19:57.149 --> 01:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
value that impacts its fair market value
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
especially with generators and so part
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the reason why at least from what
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
we've been told by our assessors that
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
there can be a disparity in what Dr is
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
assessing these um generator properties
 
01:20:11.229 --> 01:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
and what the municipality is is because
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
the municipality has much less
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
information to make an accurate
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
assessment and the assessors would just
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
like the same information that goes to
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
collected by a government entity to also
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
go to the municipal assessors
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
even they think it's more than fair to
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
make it so they have to abide by the
 
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
same confidentiality requirements of
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
Dr is more than reasonable to them and
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
also the fact that um also the fact that
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
Dr is collecting this information shows
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's not really an intrusion it's just
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
so they can make an accurate assessment
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
of the generating property um there are
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
a few other things that you know I heard
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
that was discussed today that some of
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
the assessors wanted me to raise one is
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
that we would be be treating generators
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
differently whether or not they'd be
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
owned by utilities despite that very
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
similar generator facilities that are
 
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
both attached to the transmission
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
Network would be one would be subject to
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
upt and one wouldn't be so I want to
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
flag that that that's something that
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
some of the assessors mentioned where
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
they said well you have a solar field
 
01:21:16.149 --> 01:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's not owned by a utility company
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
but you have one that's only own you
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
know that that is owned by utility
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
company you're going to be essentially
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
taxing them at different rates um I also
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
want to point out the swept tax rate
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
right now is only about A123 a124 per
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
th000 of valuation utilities property
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
tax is 660 so even if somehow the
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
municipal assessment is double what dr's
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
assessment is the tax rate still six I
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
mean you're still paying significantly
 
01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:43.430 align:start position:0%
mean you're still paying significantly
less

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so the so those are kinds of the
 
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
things that I want to mention is that
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know there would be less revenue for
 
01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
public education that's not something we
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
have a stance on at the municipal
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
Association um the assessments would be
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
you know different the municipal is
 
01:21:59.550 --> 01:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
different than Dr but a big reason for
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is because there's a lack of
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
reporting to the local Municipal
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
assessors and so in section three of the
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill where there's this reporting
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
requirement lines 22 through 26 to Dr
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
all the assessors want from all this
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
commission all the things that they
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to have addressed to limit
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuits though a lot of those things
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
didn't get include in this bill but they
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
really think to prevent lawsuits and to
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
help them do their jobs and their
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal assessing to make sure that
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's an accurate assessment fair to
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
the generator property owner um who's
 
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
not a utility company and fair to the
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to limit lawsuits is to
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
make it so then that information is not
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
just shared with the Dr assessors but
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
shared with the municipal assessors and
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's the biggest thing that will
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
prevent lawsuits otherwise you're you
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
know the assessors are still going to be
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
trying their best to assess based on the
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
publicly available information they have
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
and um the generators if they disagree
 
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
with that will still appeal or go to
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
court over it unless get that same
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
information to get an idea of some of
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
this um you know the the income from
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
producing um sorry the the income
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
producing property from the value of the
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
fair market value um it's going to be
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
difficult for municipal assessors to do
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
their job accurately and that's what
 
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
they raised during the commission report
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
and um as it's kind of been alluded to
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
other states are doing this and I really
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Harrington
 
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
and Kaplan for essentially encapsulating
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
what my testimony would be just by
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
asking I think what were the clearly
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
obvious questions with some of the
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
issues with not reporting this
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
information um so there can be accurate
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
assessments on on the municipal level
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions thank you so
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
much uh any have any
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr Vice chairman nice to
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
see you again The Honorable Ro Dees um
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
my question is around in your testimony
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
you alluded to the fact that the Dr a
 
01:23:58.270 --> 01:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
assessors um are able to secure
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
information that the municipal associate
 
01:24:04.910 --> 01:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
the municipal assessors do not currently
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
but you sort of threw in there that they
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
are bound by the same rules in terms of
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
the security of that information and I
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
think that that seems to be a really big
 
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
issue or sticking point for folks right
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
is that they don't want their business
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
information to be made public so my
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
question would be if a municipal uh
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
assessor is then give granted uh
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
access uh do they share that information
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
with the municipality or they or do they
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
simply use the data that they're privy
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
to in order to formulate the assessment
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge it's the latter um and
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
there are they I mean assessors every
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
day are handling as I mentioned in my
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
written testimony by email that I sent
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
last night they are handling
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
confidential information every single
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
day and they know how to handle that
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
information what is and what isn't
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
subject to 90 a so I I really want to
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
stress that these assessors only want to
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
see this information so then they can
 
01:25:02.109 --> 01:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
create an accurate assessment and it's
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
not information that they want to share
 
01:25:05.629 --> 01:25:05.639 align:start position:0%
with the general public and that they
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
have any interest in sharing with the
 
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
general public I mean I don't know
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what goes through their license
 
01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:11.639 align:start position:0%
Shar and certification requirements
 
01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
because they also have to um get
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
licensed and certification but I would
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
imagine some of it has to do with how
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
they collect information data and how
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
they keep that confidential and
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
organized okay the thank you the people
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
behind you are buzzing so well yeah I
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
was buzzing too
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
you for whoops representative
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
blog thank you I waited if there was
 
01:25:38.639 --> 01:25:39.590 align:start position:0%
blog thank you I waited if there was
someone

01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
else uh honorable do thank you for
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
question this point is sticking my
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
head if you could if you could have an
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
answer for me appreciate
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
it the ER has this
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
information their assessment is
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
lower pwns assessors and some of them
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
are Town's people also Selectmen or
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they're going to get this the
 
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.750 align:start position:0%
whatever they're going to get this the
same

01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
information and I'm um want to wager a
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
bet they will not assess it lower the
 
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.990 align:start position:0%
bet they will not assess it lower the
question

01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
is will they use the information they
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
get or rephrase that how can they use
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
the information they
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
it I don't know how Dr does their
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
assessments I called the line and the
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
individual who it says call to ask about
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
the utility property tax and they said
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
to call a gentleman named Chris and when
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
I called that number I didn't get a
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
response so I'm not sure how Dr does
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
their assessment for utility properties
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know the minutia of how local
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
assessors do that too so I will be
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
honest about that but local assessors
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
have shared with us several at least in
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
the last week that having this
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
additional information and understanding
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
um you know how the property generates
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
electricity how much and some of the um
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
some of the other uh things regarding um
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
you know income does help them create an
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
accurate assessment at least based on
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
how they're trained and certified and
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state of New Hampshire
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
so that is their stance again we're
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
neutral on it but we had so many complt
 
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
compl that um we weren't even going to
 
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
testify we didn't have a stance on this
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
bill and then you know we decided we
 
01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
should come forward and support our
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
assessors and say just a simple
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement that the
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
information that's going to be required
 
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
to be reported under section three of
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
this bill it going to Municipal
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
assessors will be helpful not just in
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
preventing future lawsuits between
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities and generators and saving
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
the rate payers and taxpayers money but
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
also ensuring that there is an accurate
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
assessment um we have no stance on how
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
the state raises its funds for public
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
education that doesn't impact Municipal
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
budgets it impact school district
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
budgets in the state's budget so I want
 
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
to be clear on that too we primarily
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
only care about that reporting
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
requirement and if there's going to be a
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement on this
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
information at Dr we think at least
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
based on what we've been told by our
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal assessors that there is a
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
great benefit to the municipalities and
 
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers to make sure the
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
assessors also get that
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
information the commission discussed
 
01:28:24.669 --> 01:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
this question extensively m
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
the Dr uses a a form I believe it's the
 
01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.629 align:start position:0%
the Dr uses a a form I believe it's the
form

01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:28:29.639 --> 01:28:31.790 align:start position:0%
form
A9

01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
A9
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe it's a different number but
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
anyway the Dr uses a form to collect
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
this information that's how they do
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
their assessments and
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
um we discuss that
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
extensively within the commission it's
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
all in the findings and in the minutes
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
of our meetings if you want to learn
 
01:28:55.709 --> 01:28:55.719 align:start position:0%
more about that
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you for taking my
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
question so my question would be around
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of the prior testimony that we
 
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
heard regarding whether or not there are
 
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
any other businesses for which Municipal
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
assessors require this kind of
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
information or if it would solely be
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
these businesses that are simply trying
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
to transition off of a kind of a legacy
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
utility tax that they really shouldn't
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
I'm unsure if there is or there isn't I
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
can always follow up and check with the
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
assessors um what I do know though is
 
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:35.719 align:start position:0%
that these utility generating properties
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
are as was kind of mentioned uniquely
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
different than like say a restaurant
 
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
just in their very nature and just in
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
how their ability to generate and how
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
much they generate and how much income
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
they make does greatly impact their
 
01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
property their fair market value
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I want
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your testimony and I
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
want to close the public hearing on
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
696 we'll immediately move to a public
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
708 however I have no pink cards so I
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
don't know who to call
 
01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.350 align:start position:0%
don't know who to call
on

01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh oh here we go we have a pink card
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
from the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
01:30:22.149 --> 01:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
representative Horan so representative I
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
would recognize you to introduce House
 
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:36.870 align:start position:0%
would recognize you to introduce House
Bill

01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
708 if anyone else would like to testify
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 708 please submit a pink
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.590 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much I'm represented
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan from straford County
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
District 10 the town of uh the town of
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
Durham um and uh this bill actually you
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
may remember SB the rather appropriate
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
name SB 603 which you dealt with uh last
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
back last spring and this is a kind of a
 
01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
follow on to that bill um with a
 
01:31:16.119 --> 01:31:16.990 align:start position:0%
follow on to that bill um with a
somewhat

01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
different emphasizing one issue that was
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
kind of uh not at the Forefront of the
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
debate over that one which is
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
basically the possibility actually
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
probably the certainty that at some
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
point we'll have to have a second area
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
code in New Hampshire and it will be it
 
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
would have to um nobody would would have
 
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a geographic split of the
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
area code make half the state change
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
their numbers but that um I'm quite
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
certain will not happen they will they
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
would have an overlay area code but
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
anyway so 603 has been our state's only
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
area code since October 1947 when the
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
North American numbering Plan was
 
01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.470 align:start position:0%
North American numbering Plan was
introduced

01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
um at that time there were just 86
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
numbering plan areas in the United
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
States and Canada that that was before
 
01:32:02.109 --> 01:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
we even had Direct distance dialing
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
which came in about 10 years later so
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
there and my red testimony says 335 area
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
codes I think actually what I meant is
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's 335 in the USA there's uh I
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
think I saw there's 53 in Canada there's
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know at least a couple of dozen in
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the world
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
so um it's probably more like four 400
 
01:32:25.709 --> 01:32:25.719 align:start position:0%
area codes and then there's various
 
01:32:25.719 --> 01:32:26.669 align:start position:0%
area codes and then there's various
three-digit

01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
three-digit
 
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:30.280 align:start position:0%
codes um like you know the X11 codes
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
like 911 and
 
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
411 um you know so since the 1990s
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of concern about
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
quote unquote exhausting the 603 area
 
01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:41.719 align:start position:0%
code which means basically would run out
 
01:32:45.629 --> 01:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
of available numbers and uh the north
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
numbering plan and U chis you probably
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
all know this it's there's a three-digit
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
area code um a three-digit central
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
office code code and finally a
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
four-digit station number or line
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
number and U the line and various
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
techniques have been utilized for the
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
past quarter Century the save off area
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
code 6 the exhaust date but the current
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
exhaust date is just seven years away in
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
2032 and um up till 1992 the only way to
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
create a new area code was a was a
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
geographic split like what what like
 
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
what we're concerned about happening in
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
which for example which is what we don't
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
want to have happen here in New
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um over late area Coast the
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
first one was back in 1992 when they
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
introduced area code 917 in New York
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
City I've personally lived through three
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
Geographic splits in the 1980s you know
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
they're kind of disruptive people were
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
scared about them but once they happened
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
they weren't as bad as people feared
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
beforehand but you know it's still
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
something we don't want to go through
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
so and uh so in 19 you know so avoid the
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
geographic area split in 1992 the
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
general court enacted RSA
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
37459 which discouraged such a split
 
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
while powering the well it was as a pu
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
this function has been sent over to the
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
Department of energy to take various
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
measures to exhaust the supplies to
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
available phone numb is what we like to
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
fondly refer to as the
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
603 and those measures worked well but
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
it's been somewhat um it's been somewhat
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
expensive like s SP 603 spent I think um
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
a s allocate a six-digit sum for a
 
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
consultant to uh you know Stave off the
 
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
exhaustion of 603 which uh may or may
 
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
not have been money money well spent um
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm not even sure like who the
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
consultant was or what what they did but
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
at some point you know you know at uh
 
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
some point some point that effort is
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
going to become feudal you know some
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
point we're going to have to go to the
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
overlay area code and we're actually
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
starting to run out of phone numbers um
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're even running out of the central
 
01:34:58.350 --> 01:34:58.360 align:start position:0%
office codes we're we have only we have
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
about 650 total of those you know
 
01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:02.679 align:start position:0%
central office codes such as like the
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
271 on our phone numbers here in the
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
state house um where there's only 34
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
left I mean it could be worse the 617
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
area code in Boston has zero census
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
office codes available so and um this I
 
01:35:17.669 --> 01:35:17.679 align:start position:0%
especially uh I became aware of this
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
issue personally when I had when I um
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
decided to get a Google Voice number and
 
01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
Google Voice did not have any uh 603
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
numbers available because they couldn't
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh buy the rights to them I had to get
 
01:35:28.119 --> 01:35:29.109 align:start position:0%
uh buy the rights to them I had to get
an

01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
802 uh I had to get an 802 area code for
 
01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
my Google Voice number so the
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh so anyway the
 
01:35:42.189 --> 01:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh SP sp603 was a good Bill I'm not sure
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
if I agreed totally with its uh with the
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
emphasis on you know avoiding an overlay
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
area code but it was it uh it was
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
successful and there's basically zero
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
chance of a area of a geographic area
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
code split they haven't actually tried
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
to do one since 2007 it was that was in
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
New Mexico it was a fiasco it was
 
01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.070 align:start position:0%
New Mexico it was a fiasco it was
extremely

01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
unpopular and it also I guess creates
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
more headaches for the people of the
 
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
North American numbering plan because
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
then they have to create a so-called
 
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
numbering second numbering plan area so
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's easier to keep the old numbering
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
plan area and just have a second or
 
01:36:19.390 --> 01:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
third or however many area codes you
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
need to supply enough numbers so um I
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
think the creation of a second area code
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
would actually be
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
beneficial um I think you know telephone
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
users would have a choice of more
 
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
numbers so if you have a large business
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
you could now actually have your own
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
central office code again such as the
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
271 that the state government
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
uses um also you would also you would
 
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
have more choice of a of Sev digigit num
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
numbers that spell out a phrase so like
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
I could uh like so I could probably get
 
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
like a number like whatever the overlay
 
01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
area code DT m o t y if I wanted i' like
 
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
to start have a phone number that
 
01:37:01.629 --> 01:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
spelled up my name so um I would say I
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
would say it's a time you know I think
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
it's time to uh it's time to begin
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
planning for the introduction of an
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
overlay area code which I think U which
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think would I think would be
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
beneficial and you know we would still
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
be the 603 like I mentioned
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Boston you know the
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
617 area code has been you know 617 area
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
code is shrunk to a small geographic
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
area but you know if you go to Fenway
 
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
Park the Red Sox still have 617 on their
 
01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh on 617 prbly featured their marketing
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
materials even on some of their baseball
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
caps so we would still be the 603 even
 
01:37:38.669 --> 01:37:38.679 align:start position:0%
if we had a second area code and another
 
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
thing which I don't mention my written
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
testimony um is that uh if we if we if
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
we get the second area code now we have
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
more of a choice of a number to which to
 
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
choose and there's some that might be
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
popular that are still available I'll
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
just mentioned uh I think I think I'll
 
01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
just mention something which one of my
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues pointed out which is like 420
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
popular with uh people the legalization
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
of cannabis 420 is still available as a
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
area code and there's some other uh
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
other cool numbers that are still
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
available you know though they actually
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
are running out of area codes too but
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's a whole another story so I I urge
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
you just to pass this bill it just uh
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
just Builds on what we passed last year
 
01:38:22.109 --> 01:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
in SB 603 and just you know you know
 
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:24.280 align:start position:0%
kind of clarifies things also like maybe
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
recognize the reality that we're not
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
going to be able to one area code uh
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
forever and we'll still be to Hampshire
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
we'll still be the 603 even if we have
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
one or more overlay area codes in
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
addition to the 603 so that's sgy to
 
01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
pass this bill thanks thank you could
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
you explain to us how an overlay area
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
code Works yes so it's similar I
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned for example in central Boston
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
there's uh the 617 and then lots of
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
people have 857 numbers as well so they
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
both uh apply to the same to the same
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
area and um so that's that's one near
 
01:39:05.709 --> 01:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
nearby example or so and they mentioned
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
the nine like in 91 New York City
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
there's in Manhattan has a 212 they also
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
have the 646 and they also have the 917
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
that I talked about um Al the 917 is
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
special because 91 they shared 917 with
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
also like uh an area that was split off
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
back in the mid1 1980s basically in New
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
York City they did a geographical split
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
they split Manhattan off from the outer
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
and the Bronx off from the other three
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
burls and then they uh both those burls
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
have both those areas have several
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
overlay area codes in them and then they
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
have an overlay area code that overlays
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
both of them but that's a you know
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
that's basically just like you you see a
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
lot of Massachusetts for example
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
everybody the cell phones usually have
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
different numbers and the landlines
 
01:39:48.669 --> 01:39:48.679 align:start position:0%
those are the newer overlay area codes
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
that were created I think thanks so hope
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
so over if I understand you correctly an
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
overlay area code is just a second area
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
code but it's not tied to a geographic
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
area well it's the same area well many
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
area there's many those area code what
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
we refer area codes aren't tied to
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
geographical areas but this is one
 
01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:09.639 align:start position:0%
that's that would be where you have
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
multiple area codes for the same area so
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
if they did this New Hampshire would
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
still be what they call numbering plan
 
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
area but it would now have area code 603
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
and then whatever the area code is 420
 
01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever one gets chosen for
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
us but when you dial your phone you only
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
have to use one area code correct um yes
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
you'll still have to do 10 digit dialing
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
but we we Institute which the which was
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
a stumbling block you know something
 
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
people were concerned about but we've
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
already crossed that bridge so we
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
already have 10 digit diing here in New
 
01:40:42.189 --> 01:40:42.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we got rid of that several
 
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
years ago for various reasons
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
so representative Corman thank you Mr
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative hargan
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I actually
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
have a a two-part question first one is
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
um what is it that the department of of
 
01:41:04.109 --> 01:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
energy needs to do in terms of planning
 
01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
and the second one is I noticed in the
 
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
bill there's a definition of geographic
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
split but that term is not used anywhere
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
in the bill okay the I think the
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
geographic split may appear elsewhere in
 
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
the RSA that it refers to um they um and
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
that's unnecessary well that's maybe
 
01:41:22.669 --> 01:41:22.679 align:start position:0%
maybe that's something you consider
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
during the Comm process as um what was
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
the first part repeat the first part of
 
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
the question than first part was uh what
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
is it that the department of energy
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
would need to do in in terms of planning
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
for this um nothing special I'm just
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
trying to re redirect it SP 306 uh was
 
01:41:40.679 --> 01:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
trying to re redirect it SP 306 uh was
very

01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
much was part of a campaign Governor the
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
former governor governor cunu he was uh
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
very interested in our state's iconic
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
symbols um I and the area code was was
 
01:41:53.229 --> 01:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
one of them and so we have a new
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
governor who as far as I can tell is not
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
not quite as interested in symbolic
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
things like that so the overlay area
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
code is something that's going to have
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
to happen eventually so I think it's
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
probably better to have it sooner than
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
later so that's the purpose of adding
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
RSA additional questions representative
 
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um for
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
the record I highly endorse 420 and the
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
603 um my question though is how is a
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
how is a new area code chosen is it done
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
by contest is a petition I mean how how
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
is it applied well the there's a
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
organization called the North American
 
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
numing Plan area which is uh well it's a
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
private company but it contracts with
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
the various Nations that are in the
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
North American numbering plan area so
 
01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
they uh and there's a somewhat
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
mysterious committee process so I I'd
 
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm not exactly sure how it
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
works but I'm sure if we uh but they do
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
respond if the you know this if the
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
department of energy if the state you
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
know if the department of energy says
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
we're ready to have the overlay area
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
code they'll start the process how they
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
decide which number to assign where I'm
 
01:43:12.189 --> 01:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
not 100% sure but we have probably some
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
input over it and so thank thank further
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee thank you
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
hor Horgan for being here um my question
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
is whether it's the state that would
 
01:43:27.589 --> 01:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
initiate that proceeding or whether the
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
telephone companies do that based on you
 
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
know that the need I mean who who's um I
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
understand the idea of wanting to get
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
the statutes updated which is fine but I
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
guess the point is where does the work
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
belong I mean there's there's many
 
01:43:46.109 --> 01:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
telephone companies of State when we
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
first started the area cod plan back in
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
1947 there was just uh AT&amp;T dominated
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
the market and they actually used to
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
administer this code which was first in
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
United States and Canada expanded like
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
various other places so the so this is
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
like within the purview of the it's in
 
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
the perview of the state to decide how
 
01:44:06.070 --> 01:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
to allocate the numbers and they make
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
them available to all the different uh
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
telephone carriers of which there's
 
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
dozens or perhaps even even hundreds so
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
the largest two being um for rizon y and
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
FairPoint Communications but there's
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions thank
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
you for introducing this legislation now
 
01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
let's hear from the Department of energy
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
Stone good morning Mr chair and me
 
01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
Megan Stone legislative liaison with the
 
01:44:48.550 --> 01:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
Department of energy so the department
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
is neutral on this bill however we do
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
have one main concern and that is the
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
state does not have jurisdiction over
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
um over area codes we cannot Reserve
 
01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
area codes we cannot begin planning for
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
an area code on our own the North
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
American numbering plan administrator
 
01:45:09.390 --> 01:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
has jurisdiction over when the planning
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
Begins for a new area code um Senate
 
01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 603 in 2024 instructed the
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
department to adopt conservation
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
measures to save New Hampshire 603 area
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
code the department request Ed all
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunications providers that are
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
registered to provide telecommunication
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
Ser that provide telecommunication
 
01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
service in New Hampshire and whom the
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
department has jurisdiction over to
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
undertake an inventory of their assigned
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
blocks of numbers and required them to
 
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
return those thousand blocks that were
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
less than 10% contaminated to the
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
numbering pool by March 31st 2024 close
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
to 150 blocks were returned following
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
that initial request the department has
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
also begun initial steps to move toward
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
consolidation of rate centers in New
 
01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while rate Center
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
consolidation would not conserve or
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
reclaim numbers in the traditional sense
 
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
it could drastically reduce the quantity
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
of new 10,000 NXX codes that need to be
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
opened in the future using the efforts
 
01:46:17.709 --> 01:46:17.719 align:start position:0%
already underway in the state of Maine
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
as a road map the department has
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
undertaken PR preliminary steps towards
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
that goal and has been holding
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
productive stakeholder sessions with

01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
603 being adopted the area code exhaust
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
date was anticipated to be quarter 2 of
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
2027 with a three-year planning period
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
for implementation of a new area code
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
Nampa would have begun planning efforts
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
in the second quarter of 2024
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
um Nampa does an analysis of the area
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
code exhaust dates in April and October
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
of each year because of the Department's
 
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
directive to to telecommunications
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%

01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
pool the April 2024 projection for
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
exhaust of the 603 was pushed out to the
 
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
third quarter of
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
2027 those efforts when combined with
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
continued close oversight and review of
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
daily requests for numbering resources
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
have continued to be successful and the
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
October 2024 analysis pushed the
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
projected exhaust date by almost two
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
years to the third quarter of 2029 and
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
the department anticipates that with um
 
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
continued implementation of the measures
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
we've taken uh that that will be pushed
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
out further in in the next couple of
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
reports and that is all I have happy to
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
take questions okay thank you very much
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
question questions for Miss Stone
 
01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you Mr
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Miss stone for taking
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
my question so since you said that New
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doesn't have jurisdiction over
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
area codes is there anything that the
 
01:48:08.589 --> 01:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
department of energy needs to do in
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
terms of getting a new overlay area code
 
01:48:15.149 --> 01:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
Nampa will have the once they're looking
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
at the exhaust date if we come up to
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
that exhaust date and we don't have any
 
01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
other uh and we think that will be the
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
case they will Implement a year planning
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
code follow but you said that was NAA
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
that would do that so my question was
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
about doe yes they will work with doe uh
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
once it once that once that exhaust date
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
comes up and they start that three-year
 
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
planning period NAA will work with
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
doe additional
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Miss
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
stone for being here that's good
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
detailed information we appreciate that
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
having no more pink cards I'm going to
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%

prime sponsor of this legislation
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
floor is yours representative welcome to
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
St thank you Mr chair and for the record
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Keith Ammon Hillsboro
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
District 42 New Boston Mount Vernon
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
lineb it's good to be before the science
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
technology and energy
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
committee they say some committees are
 
01:49:43.870 --> 01:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
better looking but this committee has
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
IQ so I'm here to introduce HCR to
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
and the his the background on this bill
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
is or this
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
resolution is it's one of the
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of the
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
commission to investigate the
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
implementation of Next Generation
 
01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactor technology in New
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the long title of the
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
commission uh I was going to give you
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
just a walk through
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
um resolutions are
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
symbolic they don't carry the force of
 
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.910 align:start position:0%
symbolic they don't carry the force of
law

01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
but it sends a signal to the country the
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
industry um that New Hampshire is
 
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
interested in this and we see the wisdom
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
in uh welcoming Advanced nuclear to New
 
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so just on page one of the
 
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
bill there's a lot of whereas
 
01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.910 align:start position:0%
bill there's a lot of whereas
Clauses

01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
Clauses
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
um talks about the reliability and
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency of
 
01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
nuclear it could contribute to the
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
state's energy independ
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
attendance um these next Generation
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
reactors offer improved safety
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
flexibility and
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
efficiency and generating clean carbon-
 
01:51:03.199 --> 01:51:04.390 align:start position:0%
efficiency and generating clean carbon-
free

01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
free
 
01:51:08.109 --> 01:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
energy um on line 10 now um it could
 
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
provide opportunities for economic
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
growth job creation and Innovation
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
within New
 
01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh next whereas nuclear energy
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
currently supplies nearly 60% of New
 
01:51:22.189 --> 01:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's instate electricity
 
01:51:22.199 --> 01:51:23.750 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's instate electricity
generation

01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
so new New Hampshire is already a
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
nuclear friendly
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction line 17 talks about the
 
01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
global competition we learned a lot
 
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
about that on the on our
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
commission that Russia and China are
 
01:51:41.069 --> 01:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
pursuing Supply chains globally and
 
01:51:44.109 --> 01:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
they're locking in trading partners in
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
of different countries around the world
 
01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
and they're becoming dependent on Russia
 
01:51:52.109 --> 01:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
and China's Supply chains uh and the
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
United States is falling behind
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
currently in that area so it is a
 
01:51:59.709 --> 01:51:59.719 align:start position:0%
national security issue as well um line
 
01:52:02.750 --> 01:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
20 um it's in the interest of the United
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
States to maintain leadership in
 
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.189 align:start position:0%
States to maintain leadership in
advanced

01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%

01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
technology and ensuring that it remains
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
under our nation's
 
01:52:12.189 --> 01:52:12.199 align:start position:0%
control uh line
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
23 Workforce Development it it requires
 
01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
a highly skilled and specialized
 
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce and so part of this resolution
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
is a resolution about Workforce
 
01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:23.470 align:start position:0%
is a resolution about Workforce
Development

01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
Development
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
and then finally line 27 we want to
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
nudge the NRC to speed up their uh
 
01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
approval process of advanced nuclear and
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
they're working on something called part
 
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
54 which is uh regulations specifically
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
for advanced nuclear and uh the the
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
current Administration has asked them to
 
01:52:48.510 --> 01:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
FastTrack that so this will be
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
reinforcing that idea so then 31 is the
 
01:52:51.599 --> 01:52:53.069 align:start position:0%
reinforcing that idea so then 31 is the
resolution

01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%

01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
best interest of the State of New
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%

leadership the next page to line four
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
we're urging the NRC to
 
01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:16.599 align:start position:0%
act line eight talks about the Workforce
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
Development of uh training programs to
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
build highly skilled Workforce necessary
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
so because this is sort of the the
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
ground floor maybe you could say of of
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
the advanced nuclear
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
Renaissance uh it's it would be wise for
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
our State University Systems and our
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%

01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
line 11 I think of this
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
one uh maybe uh the days of Paul Riv
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
with uh a feather pin and an ink well
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
and a parchment we're sending this
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
resolution um to these various Federal
 
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
positions including the president of the
 
01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:56.669 align:start position:0%
positions including the president of the
United

01:53:56.669 --> 01:53:56.679 align:start position:0%
United
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
States uh the president of the US Senate
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
which is also the vice president the
 
01:54:04.189 --> 01:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House of Representatives
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
and then different committee chairs in
 
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and then at the state
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
level the governor commissioners of the
 
01:54:14.910 --> 01:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
Pu commissioner of the Department of
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
energy and various other uh
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
departments so that's an overview of
 
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
this resolution and there's one trick
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
that I I didn't know years ago the the
 
01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:29.870 align:start position:0%
that I I didn't know years ago the the
Senate's

01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
Senate's
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
rules prevent them from taking up
 
01:54:32.159 --> 01:54:33.669 align:start position:0%
rules prevent them from taking up
concurrent

01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
concurrent
 
01:54:36.189 --> 01:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
resolutions so if this passes the house
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
it will be my job to get a senator uh to
 
01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:41.719 align:start position:0%
suspend the rule so that they can take
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
it up and fortunately we have three
 
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
Senators as co-sponsor so I think that's
 
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
the odds of that are are pretty high so
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
I'll with that I'll take any questions
 
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Vice chair
 
01:54:57.310 --> 01:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas rather has a uh question for you
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um very good
 
01:55:03.870 --> 01:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
explanation on this I think it's well
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
needed with this resolution uh if it
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
passes the house and the HB 189 which
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
was the definition uh adding nuclear to
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
the definition of clean energy passing
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
the house both of these put together
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
would you say that this uh is an attempt
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
to tell the world that we are ready for
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy investors to come to the
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
state and is this going to the qu uh
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
this following question is is this going
 
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
to add Credence to the National effort
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
by seeing another state is adopting this
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
type of resolution I believe so and I
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
think we'll be the only state in the
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
Northeast to do so because U most of the
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
other states have moratoriums on
 
01:55:53.229 --> 01:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
building Nuclear So
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is a comparative advantage for our
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
state in New England and as you said
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
it'll send a signal that we're
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
interested in developing this industry
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
here additional questions representative
 
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Ammon for introducing
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
this bill um I'm looking forward to
 
01:56:18.189 --> 01:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
hearing more about Advanced nuclear in
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
the emerging Tech caucus one of the
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
questions I have though is about the
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
workforce uh there isn't really uh
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
established Advanced nuclear anywhere so
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
how do you how do we spin up education
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
for a Workforce I I don't think there
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
are professors at UNH who can teach it
 
01:56:39.790 --> 01:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
um or anywhere else in the state so how
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
how do we spin that up that's a good
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
question so this resolution it doesn't
 
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
carry the force of law it's really just
 
01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:49.159 align:start position:0%
a a strong
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh on the commission for
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear we had a professor from
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
UNH a professor of physics uh sit in on
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
the commission so I do know there's at
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
least one qualified person to teach it
 
01:57:06.189 --> 01:57:06.199 align:start position:0%
um the supply chain for advanced nuclear
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
isn't just going to be about the
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
radioactive components or the reactor
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
components there's a lot of different uh
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know parts that go into
 
01:57:17.709 --> 01:57:17.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturing it so for instance in
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
Newington Westinghouse has a
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility they manufacture
 
01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
part parts of nuclear reactor plants and
 
01:57:28.109 --> 01:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
so we do have some some seeds in New
 
01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we can grow to uh you
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
know benefit from the supply chain and
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development would be a big
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I'm looking on page two
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
line five where it says um well lines
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
four and five that the New Hampshire
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
General Court urges the nuclear
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission to prioritize and
 
01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
expediate the review and approval
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
process are you advocating for any steps
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
or processes to be changed in order to
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
expediate these processes or these uh
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
reviews I think you mean expedite but
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
same difference I think no expedite
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
sorry um yeah we're we're urging them to
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a gentle urging that this
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
has taken too
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
long uh you know
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh Quicken their pace and you know not
 
01:58:28.270 --> 01:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
compromise safety but make sure that the
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
industry has some certainty on when they
 
01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
can comply with whatever regulations
 
01:58:38.350 --> 01:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
that they're going to develop followup
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
followup surely you have an idea of how
 
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
this could be accomplished to speed
 
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
things up yes I
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
do could you
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
elaborate uh they can uh improve their
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
their processes
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
and the the big issue is that they're
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
trying to shoehorn advanc nuclear into
 
01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
the old regulations for old generation
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors and so they need to
 
01:59:07.629 --> 01:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
adopt and they are they're doing this
 
01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
they're adopting a an approach that fits
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
the nature of advanced nuclear and not
 
01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:13.750 align:start position:0%
the nature of advanced nuclear and not
trying

01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
trying
 
01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
to uh not slowing that process down by
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
treating Advanced nuclear as if it's as
 
01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:23.079 align:start position:0%
dangerous as the older generation
 
01:59:26.030 --> 01:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
Nuclear So that would be that would be
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
my thought thank
 
01:59:27.760 --> 01:59:29.510 align:start position:0%
my thought thank
you

01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
so the NRC has approved a small modular
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
reactor design by new
 
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
scale they have also approved the
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
building of two molten salt reactors in
 
01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
Texas by a company called
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
Kos do you think the momentum is
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
starting to build for advanced nuclear
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
resource ources I do um just
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
coincidentally while I was sitting
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
waiting I got I I noticed this email
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to mention it's
 
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.069 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to mention it's
from

02:00:04.069 --> 02:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:00:07.149 --> 02:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh it's from Terra power which is a
 
02:00:10.229 --> 02:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear company it's uh backed
 
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
by Bill Gates they're building a plant
 
02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.149 align:start position:0%
by Bill Gates they're building a plant
in

02:00:13.149 --> 02:00:13.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
chemer uh
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
Wyoming and uh it's called the natrium
 
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
plant and
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
they they received a permit to build a
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
station unit one this month the permit
 
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
covers all construction and operational
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
activities on the natrium plant that are
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
not under the jurisdiction of the NRC so
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
they're getting started waiting for the
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
NRC and it's a significant Milestone
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
they say it would make United States a
 
02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
first mover in commercial Advanced
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
nuclear and interestingly they've
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
partnered up with a data center one of
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
the largest data center Builders um Sab
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
data centers so in their announcement
 
02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
they're announcing that they're
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
partnering with a large data center um
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you if I had a little more
 
02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
chance little opportunity olc was a
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
little backed up they were kind of
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
bombarded with a lot of bills so I
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have a chance to kind of
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
highlight this but um if you wanted to
 
02:01:16.350 --> 02:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
make a an improvement to this my
 
02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
suggestion on page
 
02:01:21.669 --> 02:01:21.679 align:start position:0%
one uh line 13 that paragraph there I
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
think would be the best place for it to
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
emphasize uh that we understand that
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
data centers AI uh Data Centers High
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
high performance compute data centers
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
are uh driving the demand for advanced
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
nuclear and I would have added that had
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
I had the opportunity but it does say uh
 
02:01:43.950 --> 02:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
it does list some manufacturing
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
Industries and businesses and so forth
 
02:01:48.669 --> 02:01:48.679 align:start position:0%
but you might want to put data center
 
02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
something about data center in that
 
02:01:50.079 --> 02:01:53.550 align:start position:0%
something about data center in that
paragraph

02:01:53.550 --> 02:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
excellent further questions
 
02:01:55.599 --> 02:01:56.830 align:start position:0%
excellent further questions
representative

02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah um just I just a couple
 
02:02:02.189 --> 02:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
quick comments on questions that could
 
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
probably add to this the you're probably
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
aware that the state of Texas has filed
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against the NRC saying that on
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
certain small modular reactors that they
 
02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
should not have jurisdiction so so that
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
is is pending out there and as far as
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
the workforce uh issue goes that's
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
become a major issue with the American
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
nuclear society which by the way I got
 
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
my golden award yesterday 50 years
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
member oh congrats and uh they estimate
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
200,000 people are going to be needed
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
but that's been identified as a major
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
issue that they are working on as one of
 
02:02:34.030 --> 02:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
their top priorities to get that
 
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
qualified Workforce because it's simply
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
has gone away because we haven't been
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
building nuclear plants so
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
inter further
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative Kap thank you
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
Ammon for bringing this bill I I uh I
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
support support your aims I think I
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
agree with that uh you know n Advanced
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
nuclear is becoming an important
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
component and will be an important
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
component of our Energy Mix in the
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
future I do have you know just to share
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
a little editorial I I do have some
 
02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
concern about the data centers is
 
02:03:08.709 --> 02:03:08.719 align:start position:0%
driving this and fact that you know
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
where is that benefit going to going to
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
land in terms of uh you know our
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
constituents um but I I just wanted to
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
ask you a question in terms of Workforce
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
Development do would you agree that that
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
in order to develop the necessary
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
Workforce this we're going to have to
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
fund education in a lot more serious
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
fashion in our state I think we're very
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
creative in how we fund things in New
 
02:03:32.589 --> 02:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I agree that funding is a
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
component and where that comes from
 
02:03:38.189 --> 02:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
determined representative L relle has a
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh I think
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
nuclear has a great deal of potential
 
02:03:49.950 --> 02:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm also wondering if I'm concerned
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the uranium War comes from
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
places like China and
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
Russia my question is will we go back
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
and do some more research on say thorium
 
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
beer reactors and other uh potential
 
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
sources of nuclear
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
energy it's a good question um I I'm my
 
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:14.119 align:start position:0%
lay understanding is that the thorium
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
reactor concept has great promise but
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's just not as far ahead as fishing
 
02:04:22.750 --> 02:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
you know uranium based fish
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh in the commission we did interview or
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
had present uh a nuclear fusion company
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
so nuclear fusion is I'm a little
 
02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
skeptical if if you can get you know
 
02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
energy for free but uh they seem to
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
think that they're on the verge of
 
02:04:43.549 --> 02:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
possibly some breakthroughs with fusion
 
02:04:46.830 --> 02:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
um and that has a lot less a fewer
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
issues with
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
radioactivity you know the the
 
02:04:52.589 --> 02:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
byproducts so that's the best I can
 
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
answer thank you representative parall
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you chair Von thank
 
02:04:58.589 --> 02:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
02:04:58.599 --> 02:05:00.229 align:start position:0%
you for being here
today

02:05:00.229 --> 02:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
um I do have concerns about this
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
technology competing with existing uh
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
non-fossil fuel
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
Alternatives um however setting that
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
aside my other concern is us getting
 
02:05:18.390 --> 02:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
these funded uh nuclear which was was
 
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
that the name of the uh um new scale new
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
scale scale MH um recently had many of
 
02:05:27.629 --> 02:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
their contracts uh cancelled in Utah
 
02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
which was Idaho which caused them you
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
know basically to send their company in
 
02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
a freeold right now and
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not aware of any other company
 
02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
right now that's been able to amass the
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
capital in order to proceed with a
 
02:05:45.069 --> 02:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
fullscale project such of this of this
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
nature I'm not saying it can't happen
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
but I miss would like your perspective
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
on that so we all have limited knowledge
 
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
right so your question isn't
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
definitive I'm going to I'm going to
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
assume um I just read you a press
 
02:06:03.910 --> 02:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
release from Terra power in Wyoming
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
that's backed by Bill Gates and the data
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
center demand is huge and there's a lot
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
of private Capital coming from data
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
centers because they need the energy to
 
02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
run their computers so there there may
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
be if we play our cards right there may
 
02:06:24.189 --> 02:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
be way to attract private Capital to
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
help fund these projects and there there
 
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
are some uh you're right it was uamps in
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
Utah uh the
 
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
municipality there was there was a a
 
02:06:38.549 --> 02:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
short seller that put out a
 
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
report and that sort of blew up that
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
deal they they they they claimed the
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
numbers didn't work out and the
 
02:06:47.709 --> 02:06:47.719 align:start position:0%
municipality agreed and they pulled out
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
of that project um data centers are
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know very highly capitalized we just
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
saw Microsoft is going to restart one of
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
the reactors in Three Mile Island so
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
they're F they're trying to find ways to
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
get carbon free firm power and that's
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
what they're looking for and advanced
 
02:07:13.709 --> 02:07:13.719 align:start position:0%
nuclear nuclear in general fits that
 
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
bill very very nicely it's 247 always on
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
and reliable power for you know the the
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
contracts that these data centers have
 
02:07:24.669 --> 02:07:24.679 align:start position:0%
with their customers you know you've
 
02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
probably heard of 59 uptime
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
99.999 perc uptime that's the the
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
standard um and you need power to to you
 
02:07:37.229 --> 02:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
know deliver that
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
uptime uh followup please yes followup
 
02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
yes um so we you would see the primary
 
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
role of many of these uh smrs is uh
 
02:07:50.189 --> 02:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
being tied directly which we did hear
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
Bill yesterday of this nature being tied
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
directly to these data centers rather
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
than providing uh electric generally
 
02:07:59.229 --> 02:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
into our existing grid I mean is that
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
kind of what I I don't think that's a
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
fair assumption so in order for a
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
project to be uh capitalized you know
 
02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
the business plan has to map out and
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
what you need is the first customer you
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
need a customer that's going to sign a
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
contract power agreement stating that th
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
that customer the data center whatever
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
it is is going to make that project
 
02:08:26.189 --> 02:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh viable once that's met once that
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
reactor is built any extra power can go
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
back to the grid and feed the customers
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire the the businesses and
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
the residences in New Hampshire so you
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
just have to think about how it scales
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
out thank you that's a good answer thank
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
you f questions representative M
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative schnella
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
refers thank you chairman Vose um
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:08:58.030 --> 02:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the last uh last question
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
any good plan has to start with
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
leadership and I think leadership will
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
have to come from the executive
 
02:09:07.589 --> 02:09:07.599 align:start position:0%
specifically the governor um have you or
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
any of the tech caucus had any material
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
discussions with the governor's office
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
um because that that's a critical
 
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
component to any plan that's a good
 
02:09:17.480 --> 02:09:19.270 align:start position:0%
component to any plan that's a good
question

02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
um Ju Just anecdotal
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
the few times that I've seen Governor
 
02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
aot I've seen her three or four times
 
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
the last couple of months and she
 
02:09:31.149 --> 02:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
mentions to me advanced nuclear Keith we
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
want to do Advanced Nuclear So I know
 
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
and she said it in her uh inaugural
 
02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
address um in debates so I know there's
 
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
interest I I've been kind of waiting for
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
the budget process to work out because I
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
know that's the main priority of the
 
02:09:48.549 --> 02:09:48.559 align:start position:0%
governor's office and once once that
 
02:09:49.589 --> 02:09:49.599 align:start position:0%
gets settled we're going to have her
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
address on Thursday so I think after
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
that after that budget is passed off to
 
02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
the house the governor's office will
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
have more uh time to pursue different
 
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
things and I plan on following up with
 
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
that and if you want to be included I'd
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate that too thank you thank
 
02:10:11.069 --> 02:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
you now representative McGee thank you
 
02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
Ammon for taking my question so um what
 
02:10:18.270 --> 02:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
I thought reading through the resolution
 
02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm happy that you're bringing it I
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
think it's Timely um but it seems like
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's a there's maybe a disconnect with
 
02:10:27.629 --> 02:10:27.639 align:start position:0%
where the resources are in the country
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
and perhaps the the resolution could
 
02:10:33.229 --> 02:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
also include a call for the federal
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
government to in to pull in our our um
 
02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:40.109 align:start position:0%
government to in to pull in our our um
our

02:10:40.109 --> 02:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:10:40.119 --> 02:10:41.830 align:start position:0%
our
existing

02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm going blank now like losal and
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
our National Labs basically we have
 
02:10:50.910 --> 02:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
technologists in those areas that are
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
highly skilled and that are often idle
 
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
in administrations that don't know how
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
to use those resources in order to
 
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
advance um the goals of the country so
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether it's appropriate
 
02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
for the resolution to also include a
 
02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
call for the National Labs to be I I'm
 
02:11:13.149 --> 02:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
sure they are already involved but um
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps that's another piece because
 
02:11:16.510 --> 02:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about trying to
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to get the workforce
 
02:11:20.109 --> 02:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
together for this which really is an
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
issue um um I would think that if you're
 
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
looking all Hands-On deck that might be
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
a good addition to the bill is to direct
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
that because they they never seem to use
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
the National Labs in any really pointed
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
way I um I think that's a excellent
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
suggestion I know there's a project p in
 
02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's Idaho National Labs that's
 
02:11:43.709 --> 02:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
a a test reactor and there there's a the
 
02:11:46.589 --> 02:11:46.599 align:start position:0%
gain program which is uh I always forget
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
what it stands for Gateway for
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
acceleration and nuclear I think it
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
stands for um and they've had
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
representative in state um trying to
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of energy and I
 
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
think even Dartmouth so there are some
 
02:12:02.910 --> 02:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
federal resources that can be brought to
 
02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
bear and I also know the the startup in
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester star cube has gotten plugged
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
into the National Lab system and they're
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
benefiting from you know they're doing
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
reactor design and so they're able to
 
02:12:18.990 --> 02:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
tap into those resources which I think
 
02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion additional
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this
 
02:12:35.709 --> 02:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
resolution we have no more pink cards is
 
02:12:36.910 --> 02:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
there anybody else who would like to
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
speak Mr chairman just a a quick comment
 
02:12:41.709 --> 02:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Harrington on on as
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
far as the National Labs go they'll be
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
evaluating the there six prototype
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
projects that were funded by the federal
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
government of various types of smrs and
 
02:12:52.149 --> 02:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
they're going for what it looks like to
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
be built and it'll be sometime I think
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
the deadline is the end of 2026 but
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
these are small prototypes and I think
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
we'll know a lot more after that comes
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
out but there is actual work being done
 
02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
and it's being directed I think by
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
Oakridge on this one
 
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
bernardy just another comment when you
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
start looking at at Workforce and and uh
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
looking for skilled people in this area
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
you don't forget that uh Naval Shipyard
 
02:13:26.589 --> 02:13:26.599 align:start position:0%
has been a nuclear uh engineering
 
02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
lab operational for years and years
 
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
there are many well-trained nuclear uh
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
um workers in that Arena as well as we
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
have uh SE brick nuclear power plant so
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is very well um suited for
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
having at least a start in some highly
 
02:13:53.390 --> 02:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:55.870 --> 02:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
okay any additional
 
02:13:59.229 --> 02:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none we are now going to
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
take a lunch break and we will return
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
here at
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
1:00 for a public hearing on House Bill
 
02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:07.990 align:start position:0%
1:00 for a public hearing on House Bill
710

02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%

FN enabling Electric utilities to own
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
operate and offer Advanced nuclear
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
resources we will see you all then and
 
02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
enjoy your lunch Mr chairman quick
 
02:14:20.239 --> 02:14:21.669 align:start position:0%
enjoy your lunch Mr chairman quick
question

02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative re do you anticipate
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh any uh executive sessions this
 
02:14:29.549 --> 02:14:29.559 align:start position:0%
afternoon after our scheduled public
 
02:14:33.189 --> 02:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
hearings well since you brought that
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
up we could do one right now before we
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
break for lunch if you like I was just
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
asking are there any bills that we
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
probably could come to um bipartisan
 
02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.669 --> 02:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
um does anybody want to make a
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion I would suggest the bill on
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion well what what is your motion
 
02:15:12.239 --> 02:15:13.109 align:start position:0%
suggestion well what what is your motion
on

02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
it yeah what your motion my motion would
 
02:15:19.149 --> 02:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
be uh itl I just don't as we heard from
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
the people from the Department of energy
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary there's already
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
activities going forward you can stretch
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
it out for so long and I don't think
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
that this bill is going to add to that
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
at all so besides we're also told that
 
02:15:32.549 --> 02:15:32.559 align:start position:0%
the department of energy doesn't have
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
authority to do what the bill is asking
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
it to
 
02:15:38.589 --> 02:15:38.599 align:start position:0%
do all right let's have a show of hands
 
02:15:41.470 --> 02:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
of people who would probably go uh who
 
02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
would be likely to go along with a
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
708 all right looks like a a majority
 
02:15:54.189 --> 02:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh would agree to that so let's call an
 
02:15:57.149 --> 02:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
executive session then on House Bill
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
7008 and I recognize representative
 
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington for a motion I I move
 
02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to legislate on House Bill
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
708 I recognize representative
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
McGee and I will second that motion
 
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded that we adopt the
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
motion of itl on House Bill 7008 further
 
02:16:17.840 --> 02:16:24.109 align:start position:0%
motion of itl on House Bill 7008 further
discussion

02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:24.119 --> 02:16:25.470 align:start position:0%
 
seeing

02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
none I'm going
 
02:16:31.229 --> 02:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
to see if I can delay things for a few
 
02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
minutes so the clerk can get his
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
paperwork act together so that we can
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
actually do this sorry to Spring this on
 
02:16:43.309 --> 02:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
you so unexpectedly but it was um a
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:16:46.589 --> 02:16:46.599 align:start position:0%
unexpected on my part too until
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
representative rols suggested that it
 
02:16:56.950 --> 02:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.270 --> 02:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a good idea if if if we
 
02:17:03.629 --> 02:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
can reach consensus as a committee why
 
02:17:07.309 --> 02:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
not you know dispose of these bills when
 
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity in this case
 
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's an itl but it could have been an
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
OTP if we all agree
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
so Arrington and who did the second
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
second by representative McGee so it's
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
been moved and seconded
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
that we adopt the motion of itl on the
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
question of on House Bill 708 rather so
 
02:17:31.070 --> 02:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
I would ask the
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the question
 
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the adoption of the motion of itl on
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%

committee
 
02:18:58.830 --> 02:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
report no Minority Report report is
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
necessary with that we'll close the
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
02:19:07.509 --> 02:19:07.519 align:start position:0%
708 and we have a few more minutes does
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
anybody have another suggestion for an
 
02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
an executive session
 
02:19:16.349 --> 02:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
bill I personally do not but
 
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
representative scheller would 672 be too
 
02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:21.870 align:start position:0%
representative scheller would 672 be too
involved

02:19:21.870 --> 02:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
to address at this time
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
672 refresh our memory uh allow for
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
offgrid electricity providers in New
 
02:19:32.429 --> 02:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes I I don't think we're
 
02:19:34.110 --> 02:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
ready for that one I think maybe an
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
amendment might be necessary for that
 
02:19:41.549 --> 02:19:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:41.559 --> 02:19:44.230 align:start position:0%
 
suggestions

02:19:44.230 --> 02:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
hcr2 um I think we had talked about a
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
possible amendment to that but we could
 
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
we could go without one if you wanted um
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
I think you should do the amendment
 
02:19:58.830 --> 02:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
makes more powerful on the floor okay
 
02:20:00.429 --> 02:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
it's been suggested that we wait for an
 
02:20:02.349 --> 02:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
amendment on that
 
02:20:02.359 --> 02:20:04.389 align:start position:0%
amendment on that
one

02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
ideas purely in the interest of making
 
02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
possible okay seeing none
 
02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:24.630 align:start position:0%
possible okay seeing none
representative

02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair I'm reading
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
through the list here and I'm wondering
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
if we could look at HB
 
02:20:36.550 --> 02:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
535 which is relative to defining the
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
role of the Public Utilities
 
02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
Commission and I would be in favor of
 
02:20:44.349 --> 02:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
OTP because I know all that does is
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
basically say that it requires two
 
02:20:48.910 --> 02:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to make
 
02:20:51.309 --> 02:20:51.319 align:start position:0%
decisions um no that's not the that's
 
02:20:54.030 --> 02:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
not the one no we already exec that one
 
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
so which is this one this is the one
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
that uh don Cree had written um removing
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
the enforcement from the Pu oh oh yeah
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay sorry about that so I don't
 
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
know if we're ready to vote on that I
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we're ready for that one
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're not ready s right we don't want to
 
02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:17.469 --> 02:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
well we might have time this afternoon
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
if any other ideas occur to you at 7 at
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
1:00 we're going to hear House Bill
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
710 requiring Electric utilities to own
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
operate and offer Advanced nuclear
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
resources I would guess that bill would
 
02:21:41.230 --> 02:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
probably need an amendment so that one
 
02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
probably won't be a candidate and then
 
02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:45.150 align:start position:0%
probably won't be a candidate and then
at

02:21:45.150 --> 02:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
1:30 probably for the remainder of the
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon we're going to be hearing HB
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
764 which is
 
02:21:57.150 --> 02:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
the bill that prohibits the intentional
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
release of polluting emissions including
 
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding weather modification
 
02:22:04.590 --> 02:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
excessive electromagnetic radio
 
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
frequency and microwave radiation I can
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
make a motion on that one right
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
now well I think we have to have the
 
02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing first but I I I
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate your sentiments on that one
 
02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
well will we have the five o'l deadline
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
on that we do have a five o' deadline
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
good but if we should by some uh Stroke
 
02:22:29.630 --> 02:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
of Luck finish at 4:30 we could consider
 
02:22:32.590 --> 02:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
an executive session on that bill or any
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
other Bill Mr chairman I have another
 
02:22:40.030 --> 02:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill potential okay um we just voted uh
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
we just voted on the area code Bill
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
directing the department of energy we
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
have another bill like that which is
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
directing the department of energy to
 
02:22:49.750 --> 02:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
investigate the state's withdrawal from
 
02:22:51.070 --> 02:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
the isoo
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's going to be any
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
that how many people would what would
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill well I I don't really agree with
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
the premise of pulling out so I don't
 
02:23:13.230 --> 02:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
really agree with asking them to waste
 
02:23:15.269 --> 02:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
their time studying it but that's just
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
my personal opinion I think we still
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
have to vote the bill out of committee I
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
just think it's probably ready to vote
 
02:23:22.349 --> 02:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:23:24.750 --> 02:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
committee I'm actually waiting for some
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
information from the um the committee
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
bill is there any other comment on the
 
02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
possibility that we might take up that
 
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
bill vice chair Thomas U yes Mr chairman
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
No I um I think we needs just a little
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
more thought U maybe until next week I I
 
02:23:51.469 --> 02:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
have a thought I want to present to the
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh chairman uh as to how we might want
 
02:23:57.230 --> 02:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
to perhap perhaps have a an amendment
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
but it's just a thought um before we
 
02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
make a decision right now that the
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
thought could be done over lunch as well
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
so I just want to have a little bit of
 
02:24:06.510 --> 02:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
time to talk about
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Swanson Mr chair
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
earlier uh speaking of information uh
 
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
did you mention that you had sent out a
 
02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
or fored a 40 page report uh earlier on
 
02:24:21.870 --> 02:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
696 uh yes Davis Allen the committee
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
researcher sent it to um all members
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
probably to their legislative email so I
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
should look for something from Davis yes
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
correct turn on your microphone please
 
02:24:42.230 --> 02:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's also cited as a hot link in the
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
letter from the New England power
 
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
generators Association can get it that
 
02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:47.349 align:start position:0%
generators Association can get it that
way

02:24:47.349 --> 02:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
too thank you yes representative McGee
 
02:24:55.070 --> 02:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I just had a thought we
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
had quite a bit of test quite a bit of
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
testimony yesterday um on the on HB 723
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
and then I also had the presentation I
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
did in the morning on um
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
681 I'm wondering if we could um
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to retain the bills
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
related to the data platform because we
 
02:25:21.389 --> 02:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
don't yet have the information on the
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
cost uh or the cost benefits so after 5
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
and a half years of work I think the
 
02:25:30.030 --> 02:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
committee could probably um Supply that
 
02:25:31.950 --> 02:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
for the certainly the members who've
 
02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
donated their time and uh the people all
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
over the country who've been trying to
 
02:25:40.349 --> 02:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
help us get to this as a state um so I
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just I would ask that we could
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
probably vote on those two bills but not
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
up or down based on our IND individual
 
02:25:51.429 --> 02:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
feelings but to be retained so that we
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
can receive the information that they've
 
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
been working to develop all these years
 
02:25:58.269 --> 02:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas uh thank you Mr
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
chairman uh it just so happens that and
 
02:26:03.389 --> 02:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
just this for information it just so
 
02:26:05.309 --> 02:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
happens that this morning at the chair
 
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
Vice chair meeting um clerk Paul Smith
 
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
talked about retaining bills and just as
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
a reminder that any bill that was put uh
 
02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:15.710 align:start position:0%
a reminder that any bill that was put uh
for

02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:26:19.269 --> 02:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
retain we would not be able to discuss
 
02:26:25.150 --> 02:26:25.160 align:start position:0%
it as a committee until the end of June
 
02:26:27.469 --> 02:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
and because of the active bills that are
 
02:26:30.990 --> 02:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
going forth now in in the in the the
 
02:26:33.870 --> 02:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
state house and as we all know when we
 
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
come to July uh we can certainly start
 
02:26:38.830 --> 02:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
taking a retained bills but it will not
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
be in the L it'll be in the other
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
location to be named later and any bills
 
02:26:47.309 --> 02:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
put on retained would not be able to
 
02:26:49.630 --> 02:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
come up before the house until the
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
following year year
 
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
reminder okay so I I'm not personally
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
ready to make a judgment on whether
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
those bills should be retained so I
 
02:27:09.309 --> 02:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
don't think we can do anything on that
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
today representative Corman thank you uh
 
02:27:14.510 --> 02:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
I actually like the idea of retaining
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
them because the rfps won't really be
 
02:27:19.389 --> 02:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
coming in until August is what we're
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
told so we can't really do anything
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
until the fall and uh to Vice chair
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
Thomas's point about that any retained
 
02:27:30.910 --> 02:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
bills would be heard in the location to
 
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
be named um well that'll give us good
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
practice in in dealing with it without a
 
02:27:40.389 --> 02:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:40.399 --> 02:27:42.710 align:start position:0%
 
interference

02:27:42.710 --> 02:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
interference
 
02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
okay like I said I don't think we should
 
02:27:48.750 --> 02:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
consider that today but at a future date
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we can consider that
 
02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:53.349 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we can consider that
representative

02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:27:57.830 --> 02:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
Swanson uh being a new guy here uh am I
 
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh this would uh
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
extend I mean does the committee
 
02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
normally meet uh beyond the Fourth of
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
July through the summer
 
02:28:09.150 --> 02:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
season so retain means that the
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
committee hangs on to the bill it
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't turn it over to the house with a
 
02:28:15.870 --> 02:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation because the committee has
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
decided it wants to do additional work
 
02:28:20.590 --> 02:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
on the bill so what happens is the
 
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
retained bill is typically taken up in
 
02:28:26.910 --> 02:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
the fall after the summer
 
02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:28.590 align:start position:0%
the fall after the summer
recess

02:28:28.590 --> 02:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
recess
 
02:28:31.230 --> 02:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
and there is a deadline it's usually
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere around the 12th or 15th of
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
November that all retained bills have to
 
02:28:40.710 --> 02:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
be reported out so what would happen is
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the fall we'd get back together and
 
02:28:45.790 --> 02:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
we'd say okay we retain these two bills
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do with it we have
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
to have a report by November the report
 
02:28:54.670 --> 02:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
has to be ought to pass or
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
itl and uh we would figure that out make
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
a recommendation and that would happen U
 
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
by the deadline in November so the
 
02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
reference to the alternative to the L
 
02:29:09.870 --> 02:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
yet to be named isn't like right
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
sometime in July it's the time frame you
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned correct the the the the
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussion of the
 
02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
lob revolves around the fact that on
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
July 1st the lob closes for one year and
 
02:29:27.389 --> 02:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
all future committee activity after that
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
date takes place at a building somewhere
 
02:29:32.269 --> 02:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
else here in conquer I'm not exactly
 
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
sure where where it is um and so that's
 
02:29:38.349 --> 02:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
impact our activity for the year that
 
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
the L is closed because we're not going
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
to be right next door to the state house
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
like we are now we're not going to be
 
02:29:50.349 --> 02:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
right next door to OS like we are right
 
02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
now we're not going to be right next
 
02:29:54.670 --> 02:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
door to the cafeteria like we are right
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
now so uh a lot of the activity that we
 
02:30:02.910 --> 02:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
engage in over that year is going to be
 
02:30:07.349 --> 02:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
quite different um for example let's say
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
you've introduced a
 
02:30:09.359 --> 02:30:11.429 align:start position:0%
you've introduced a
bill

02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
um that the Senate is hearing well the
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
Senate is going to continue hearing
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
bills in the state house but you're
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
going to be in the building that the
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
house is using to hear its
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
bills and I don't know the exact
 
02:30:28.590 --> 02:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
distance between the buildings but I
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
think it's maybe a half a mile or more
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
or more so you're not going to be able
 
02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
to just you know run out the door and
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
say I got to dash over to the state
 
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
house to testify on a Senate bill or a
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill before the Senate you're going to
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
have to carefully plan your
 
02:30:48.190 --> 02:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
activity um with regard to bills that
 
02:30:51.469 --> 02:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
are being heard before the Senate so
 
02:30:52.830 --> 02:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
complicated but and it's going to be new
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
to all of us because this is my 11th
 
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
year as a state representative i' I've
 
02:31:01.630 --> 02:31:01.640 align:start position:0%
never had to do something like that
 
02:31:04.750 --> 02:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
before to meet in your car so pardon you
 
02:31:07.110 --> 02:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
get to meet in your car understood I
 
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
just I I wanted to make sure I I was
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
inferring that we were going to take it
 
02:31:14.349 --> 02:31:14.359 align:start position:0%
up right after the new replacement L was
 
02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
open but I understand your schedule now
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
there's no mileage paid um between July
 
02:31:24.750 --> 02:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
1st and about August 15th therefore most
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
of us would prefer not to conduct any
 
02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislative business during that period
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
of time since we don't get reimbursed
 
02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:31.910 align:start position:0%
of time since we don't get reimbursed
for

02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
mileage and the speaker's office
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
discourages us from doing any
 
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
legislative business during that time so
 
02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
typically you don't take up a retain
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:49.950 --> 02:31:49.960 align:start position:0%

04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
resources that statute was actually
 
04:04:10.070 --> 04:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
passed many many many years ago but is
 
04:04:13.070 --> 04:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
never actually used until very recently
 
04:04:17.910 --> 04:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
when Unitil built a or or got permission
 
04:04:22.990 --> 04:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
to build a five megawatt solar farm
 
04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
in Kingston I believe is the location
 
04:04:29.870 --> 04:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
correct um that facility is currently
 
04:04:31.590 --> 04:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
under construction and will probably
 
04:04:35.070 --> 04:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
come online sometime in the spring or
 
04:04:38.189 --> 04:04:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.389 --> 04:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
year so 574g enabled that project and I
 
04:04:43.399 --> 04:04:44.469 align:start position:0%
year so 574g enabled that project and I
have

04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
followed the same model here to add
 
04:04:51.510 --> 04:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear Advanced nuclear resources to
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
that model the first task of the bill is
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
to Define what Advanced nuclear resource
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
means and that is on page one of the
 
04:05:06.030 --> 04:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
bill line three and four where it
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
defines an advanced nuclear Resource as
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
any micro mini or small nuclear reactor
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
having a generating Capac capacity
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 90
 
04:05:16.399 --> 04:05:19.750 align:start position:0%
between 1 and 90
megaw

04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:23.790 --> 04:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
now the nuclear industry frequently
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
defines Advanced nuclear resources to be
 
04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
up to 300
 
04:05:32.990 --> 04:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
megawatts and I chose 90 for the
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill mostly to get a
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
conversation started it could even be
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
potentially as low as 30 for the upper
 
04:05:47.429 --> 04:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
limit or it could go go up to 300
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's a detail and a decision that we
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
could make collectively as a
 
04:05:57.070 --> 04:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
committee so that's what the first
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
section of the bill does is it inserts
 
04:06:03.469 --> 04:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
the definition AD of advanced nuclear
 
04:06:07.229 --> 04:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
resources into
 
04:06:09.790 --> 04:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
statute section two of the bill restu
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
restructuring policy
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
principles which is lines 5 through 30
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
on page
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
1 and lines
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
1 through 18 on page
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
two this is actually
 
04:06:32.790 --> 04:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary text that doesn't actually
 
04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
need to be in this bill and so I'm going
 
04:06:40.670 --> 04:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
to uh State on the record now that I am
 
04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of removing via
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that portion of this
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
legislation um once we decide whether or
 
04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
not we're going to adopt
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
it so the essence of the bill then
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
starts on page two line 19 section
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
three and this is the section that I
 
04:07:05.790 --> 04:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
described as
 
04:07:09.389 --> 04:07:09.399 align:start position:0%
enabling New Hampshire utilities
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
to invest in advanced nuclear resources
 
04:07:18.990 --> 04:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
forces and this follows the model of the
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
existing statute that enables
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
the investments in distributed energy
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
resources which typically
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
means solar or wind or
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
Hydro so
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
the the key wording
 
04:07:44.830 --> 04:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.840 --> 04:07:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
is

04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
that text that's starts on line 22 and
 
04:07:55.389 --> 04:07:55.399 align:start position:0%
is in bold and allows 15% for advanced
 
04:08:01.109 --> 04:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
nuclear resources as defined in RSA 374
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
F2 which we defined at the very
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
beginning of the
 
04:08:11.670 --> 04:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
legislation this 15% limit is also a
 
04:08:15.630 --> 04:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.149 --> 04:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
and then in line
 
04:08:22.830 --> 04:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
26 this is a a line that talks about
 
04:08:27.189 --> 04:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
the in in section two line 22 talks
 
04:08:31.109 --> 04:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
about an individual project in line 26
 
04:08:33.550 --> 04:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
in Section 3 talks about cumulative
 
04:08:36.990 --> 04:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
projects owned by a single uh
 
04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
utility and 8% in that line is also a
 
04:08:46.429 --> 04:08:46.439 align:start position:0%
starting point for dis
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
discussion and then the fourth section
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.080 --> 04:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
a assignment of Duties to the
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator of nuclear development and
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
Regulatory activities which is an
 
04:09:05.520 --> 04:09:07.229 align:start position:0%
Regulatory activities which is an
existing

04:09:07.229 --> 04:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
house statutory position and it just
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
this text just gives to that office
 
04:09:15.600 --> 04:09:16.750 align:start position:0%
this text just gives to that office
additional

04:09:16.750 --> 04:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:09:22.030 --> 04:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
duties um with regard to nuclear
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
activities in New Hampshire and
 
04:09:25.600 --> 04:09:27.070 align:start position:0%
activities in New Hampshire and
surrounding

04:09:27.070 --> 04:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
surrounding
 
04:09:31.229 --> 04:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
states and the the new text the text on
 
04:09:34.910 --> 04:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page two is existing text
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
and then the new text on the top of Page
 
04:09:41.910 --> 04:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
Three is the text that the bill adds to
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
include the management of funding and
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
oversight of nuclear incentive programs
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
such as those described in our Essa 374
 
04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
G4 which is the text that was modified
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
on the previous page as well as to uh as
 
04:10:00.830 --> 04:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
well as Outreach programs to inform and
 
04:10:02.790 --> 04:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
educate the public particularly
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
regarding safety so that's what the bill
 
04:10:09.630 --> 04:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
does and the purpose of the bill is
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.870 --> 04:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
future activity for advanced nuclear
 
04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
resources there probably isn't going to
 
04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
be any kind of immediate activity on the
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
part of the state's utilities to jump on
 
04:10:29.389 --> 04:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
the bandwagon and start building
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
resources it might be 10 years from now
 
04:10:37.389 --> 04:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
before anybody took advantage of this
 
04:10:40.349 --> 04:10:40.359 align:start position:0%
legislation but that happened with the
 
04:10:44.910 --> 04:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
it took 15 or 20 years before somebody
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
took advantage of this legislation so
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
it's enabling
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and it tells the world that
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is open for business when
 
04:10:59.710 --> 04:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
it comes to nuclear energy it also ties
 
04:11:03.830 --> 04:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
in uh kind of neatly to
 
04:11:08.830 --> 04:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
the um the house resolution that we P
 
04:11:13.389 --> 04:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
that we heard earlier today that once
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
make the same declaration that New
 
04:11:20.750 --> 04:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to be involved in
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
forward we've all heard the talk about
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
the growth of data centers and the the
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
promise of the explosive growth of
 
04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
AI all of which is going to be extremely
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
power hungry
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
likelyhood the likelihood is that it
 
04:11:46.630 --> 04:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
will require some kind of nuclear energy
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
to meet those growing energy demands so
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
to enable New Hampshire to get in in on
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
the ground floor of some of that
 
04:12:01.550 --> 04:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
activity is why I introduce this bill
 
04:12:05.630 --> 04:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
and uh why I think it's important for us
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
to move forward to show that we're ready
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
when the time comes to take advantage of
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear resources and with that
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative o
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
excellent testimony on an issue that we
 
04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
all know is coming and we welcome all
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
the U messaging we can get to tell New
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire investors that we're open for
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
business questions I'll I'll start with
 
04:12:39.189 --> 04:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative Wendy
 
04:12:42.710 --> 04:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr Vice chair I'm I'm
 
04:12:42.720 --> 04:12:44.269 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr Vice chair I'm I'm
shocked

04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
shocked
 
04:12:47.469 --> 04:12:47.479 align:start position:0%
um so on on page two just a
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on line 34 you talk about
 
04:12:53.070 --> 04:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
the coordinator of nuclear development
 
04:12:55.349 --> 04:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
where does that position lie is it under
 
04:12:58.030 --> 04:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
the department of energy or is it within
 
04:12:58.040 --> 04:12:59.429 align:start position:0%
the department of energy or is it within
pu

04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
pu
 
04:13:03.870 --> 04:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
or where does that coordinator
 
04:13:06.429 --> 04:13:06.439 align:start position:0%
live it is the Department of energy I
 
04:13:09.389 --> 04:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
believe it's the office of energy
 
04:13:11.790 --> 04:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
Innovation okay but the doe is here they
 
04:13:15.109 --> 04:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
can clarify that okay if I'm
 
04:13:15.119 --> 04:13:17.590 align:start position:0%
can clarify that okay if I'm
wrong

04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair uh so if I
 
04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
am understanding this right you are in
 
04:13:28.630 --> 04:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
this draft anyway limiting the size of a
 
04:13:31.750 --> 04:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
reactor to 90 megawatt and utilities
 
04:13:34.349 --> 04:13:34.359 align:start position:0%
ownership to no more than
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
15% so that would be a maximum of 13 12
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
megawatts of size that they could have
 
04:13:45.109 --> 04:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
their hands around is that
 
04:13:47.070 --> 04:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
correct so the first part of your
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
question was about the definition
 
04:13:51.710 --> 04:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
limiting the size to 90
 
04:13:51.720 --> 04:13:53.870 align:start position:0%
limiting the size to 90
megawatts

04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
04:13:57.309 --> 04:13:57.319 align:start position:0%
um as I said in my introduction
 
04:14:01.389 --> 04:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
negotiable that number is Up For Debate
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
and I think we should have that debate
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
and decide what the best number
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
is the second part of your question was
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
about the 15% number on line 22 on page
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
to that relates to the utili Total
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
distribution Peak load in
 
04:14:21.239 --> 04:14:22.790 align:start position:0%
distribution Peak load in
megawatts

04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh that could be up you know 15% of that
 
04:14:30.550 --> 04:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
could be provided by Advanced nuclear
 
04:14:33.229 --> 04:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
resources so the utility's Total
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
distribution Peak load depends on the
 
04:14:39.870 --> 04:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
utility uh the bigger the utility the
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
bigger the the peak
 
04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
load thank you
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr Vice
 
04:14:48.510 --> 04:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr chairman for
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so as many of you
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
know I'm married to a PhD nuclear
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
engineer and one of the things that he
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
has uh mentioned to me over time is that
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
an issue with the smaller reactors and
 
04:15:03.790 --> 04:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
micro reactors is the cost um to
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
implement them that it's not cost
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
effective so I just did a quick search
 
04:15:11.149 --> 04:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
here and um it says that a 90 megawatt
 
04:15:14.349 --> 04:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
scale nuclear reactor an SMR would cost
 
04:15:16.510 --> 04:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 300 million and 900
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
million to build and then the cost per
 
04:15:22.750 --> 04:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
kilowatt would be ranging from 3,000 to
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
5,000 per kilowatt so my question is um
 
04:15:31.389 --> 04:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
I understand the aim of the bill uh but
 
04:15:35.229 --> 04:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
it does two things that concern me it
 
04:15:38.469 --> 04:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
undoes um 374 in terms of its attempts
 
04:15:42.550 --> 04:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
to deregulate and take the utilities out
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the generation market and it kind of
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
reverses that by asking them to get back
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
in a major way to generation but it also
 
04:15:54.510 --> 04:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
puts the rate pairs on the hook for what
 
04:15:56.469 --> 04:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
could be really exorbitant costs so if
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
we're worried about little costs like
 
04:16:01.630 --> 04:16:01.640 align:start position:0%
paying for Energy Efficiency and uh
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund and that kind of
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
thing we're cutting things like that it
 
04:16:07.149 --> 04:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
this would be very counterproductive in
 
04:16:10.149 --> 04:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
terms of what people would be
 
04:16:13.870 --> 04:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
on um on the is your question what the
 
04:16:16.349 --> 04:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
right thing people would be on the hook
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
for a substantial amount of money and
 
04:16:19.710 --> 04:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to get away from
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
it because they'd be able to be
 
04:16:24.269 --> 04:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursed right I that's what I'm
 
04:16:25.269 --> 04:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm asking I'm just saying
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
the cost piece of it seems like it's not
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
a good thing to
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
enable yes I I was just waiting for you
 
04:16:34.149 --> 04:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
to finish before I responded I really
 
04:16:36.790 --> 04:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you're absolutely right
 
04:16:41.070 --> 04:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
that the cost estimates for these
 
04:16:44.710 --> 04:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
reactors today are very high
 
04:16:48.429 --> 04:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
but as we discussed when we talked about
 
04:16:48.439 --> 04:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
but as we discussed when we talked about
HCR

04:16:49.990 --> 04:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
HCR
 
04:16:54.990 --> 04:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
4 we're on the cusp of a significant
 
04:16:59.229 --> 04:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
revolution in small modular reactors and
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
as they get built in more in more in
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
larger and larger numbers we're going to
 
04:17:07.750 --> 04:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
see the costs come
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
down and then there are companies like
 
04:17:12.910 --> 04:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
starcube which are building very small r
 
04:17:17.070 --> 04:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
actors in The 1 to 5 Mega megawatt range
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
which are much less expensive than the
 
04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
the ones that you cited uh probably
 
04:17:25.469 --> 04:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
still too expensive to make a difference
 
04:17:28.590 --> 04:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
right now but eventually those costs
 
04:17:32.349 --> 04:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
have the potential to come down and what
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see and I think a lot of
 
04:17:36.429 --> 04:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire would like to
 
04:17:40.109 --> 04:17:40.119 align:start position:0%
see is that when those costs do get into
 
04:17:43.870 --> 04:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
the range of feasibility it we're ready
 
04:17:47.910 --> 04:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
to move and adapt that technology adopt
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
possible uh yes represent McGee let's
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
play a little game here let's play
 
04:18:01.189 --> 04:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy and put your answer in the form
 
04:18:03.269 --> 04:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
question I find that so difficult but I
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
will try so the question is uh does it
 
04:18:12.910 --> 04:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
make sense for us to pass a bill that
 
04:18:15.910 --> 04:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
allows the utilities to go back into
 
04:18:15.920 --> 04:18:17.189 align:start position:0%
allows the utilities to go back into
owning

04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
owning
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
generation uh when we spent so much time
 
04:18:25.870 --> 04:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh eliminating that ability on the rap
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
Paradigm well we allow it for
 
04:18:31.070 --> 04:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
distributed any energy resources so I
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
adopted that model for for this
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
legislation uh if it's good for
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources why
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be good for advanced
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear resources it seems to me that
 
04:18:46.189 --> 04:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
they're they're both equally valid
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
resources they're both Clean Energy
 
04:18:49.040 --> 04:18:51.070 align:start position:0%
resources they're both Clean Energy
Technologies

04:18:51.070 --> 04:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
Technologies
 
04:18:54.630 --> 04:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
so uh if it's good enough to do it for
 
04:18:56.750 --> 04:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
deers it's good enough to do it for a
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
anrs I
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah just I just a little
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
back of the uh envelope calculation it
 
04:19:10.030 --> 04:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
looks like to me the
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
15% uh of the uh total distrib bution
 
04:19:15.109 --> 04:19:15.119 align:start position:0%
Peak would be somewhere in the vicinity
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
of about 300 megaw so we're talking
 
04:19:20.429 --> 04:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
about a substantial amount of purchase
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
that would be able here and my
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is it would be in no
 
04:19:26.670 --> 04:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
larger than 90 megawatt blocks so
 
04:19:28.109 --> 04:19:28.119 align:start position:0%
because that would be the maximum size
 
04:19:30.109 --> 04:19:30.119 align:start position:0%
that would qualify would be 90
 
04:19:33.269 --> 04:19:33.279 align:start position:0%
megaw so are we talking about reversing
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
restructuring and going back to the old
 
04:19:37.469 --> 04:19:37.479 align:start position:0%
way where the rate payers take the risk
 
04:19:40.030 --> 04:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
rather than the stockholders and if
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying the price is going to come
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
down because these going to be money
 
04:19:45.670 --> 04:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
many of these are going to be built then
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
why do we need to go back to the rate
 
04:19:48.590 --> 04:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
payers taking the risk and let the
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
stockholders do it if someone wants to
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
invest in these when the price becomes
 
04:19:54.030 --> 04:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
affordable they'll invest in it we don't
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
need to have the utilities or the rate
 
04:19:58.830 --> 04:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
payers funding the utilities again as a
 
04:19:58.840 --> 04:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
payers funding the utilities again as a
back

04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
stop and I'm not advocating that the Pu
 
04:20:06.469 --> 04:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
in the docket that Unitil brought
 
04:20:09.109 --> 04:20:09.119 align:start position:0%
forward to recover its costs for
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
developing its 5 megawatt deer facility
 
04:20:13.149 --> 04:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
in Kingston
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
had to justify those costs as being just
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
and reasonable to rate payers and so any
 
04:20:20.670 --> 04:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
project brought forward under this
 
04:20:22.630 --> 04:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
legislation would also have to go before
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
the Pu and be justified as uh just and
 
04:20:30.030 --> 04:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable before it could go forward so
 
04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
if as you say this turns out to be
 
04:20:36.389 --> 04:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive then the Pu will say
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
no and not allow it to be built or cost
 
04:20:42.349 --> 04:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
recovered followup follow up I just may
 
04:20:44.349 --> 04:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
add that most of the costs from seabook
 
04:20:46.630 --> 04:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
will declared Justin reasonable too and
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
you look what that got us I just think
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
this is a major change that we ought to
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
it see more other questions thank you
 
04:21:03.389 --> 04:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
representative good testimony uh next
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
I'll call up to the desk Mr Megan Stone
 
04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:26.469 --> 04:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
04:21:27.870 --> 04:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Megan Stone
 
04:21:29.550 --> 04:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
legislatively as on with the Department
 
04:21:31.790 --> 04:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
of energy and I'm joined here by Matt
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
Young um an attorney with the Department
 
04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
um so the department is neutral on House
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 710 and the department appreciates
 
04:21:43.149 --> 04:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
the sponsors and Alle legislature's
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
intent to show that New Hampshire is
 
04:21:46.950 --> 04:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
open for business to advance nuclear and
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
other resources this bill is the latest
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
effort of many that show how seriously
 
04:21:54.109 --> 04:21:54.119 align:start position:0%
the committee is taking resource
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
adequacy challenges that face New
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
England as introduced the department has
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
two points that we would just like to
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
bring to the committee's attention um
 
04:22:06.109 --> 04:22:06.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 710 intro includes anr
 
04:22:08.070 --> 04:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
options alongside renewable energy
 
04:22:12.910 --> 04:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
sources for Utilities in RSA 374 F2 um
 
04:22:15.149 --> 04:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
the restructuring statute the department
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
would like to urge thoughtfulness
 
04:22:18.590 --> 04:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
regarding adding exceptions to the
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
statute should more be added the
 
04:22:22.349 --> 04:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
department would ask the committee to
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
consider whether this moves away from
 
04:22:26.710 --> 04:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
the original intent of
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
restructuring and the department
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
believes uh also that there could be a
 
04:22:32.109 --> 04:22:32.119 align:start position:0%
risk of stranded cost should these
 
04:22:35.950 --> 04:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
structures be built um the department
 
04:22:37.990 --> 04:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
believes there is a risk that all payers
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
could end up on the hook um for this the
 
04:22:44.349 --> 04:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
department is not uh opposed to the idea
 
04:22:46.389 --> 04:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
proposed by House Bill 710 however the
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
bill represents a very significant
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
change and the department believes
 
04:22:55.109 --> 04:22:55.119 align:start position:0%
taking a method method methodical sorry
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
holistic approach could add value
 
04:22:59.910 --> 04:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
whether that is through a department L
 
04:23:02.670 --> 04:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
investigation into anr's study committee
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
or another mechanism further thought to
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
ensure it is done correctly and to
 
04:23:10.510 --> 04:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
protect rate payers in the future New
 
04:23:12.070 --> 04:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should not just lead the way
 
04:23:14.149 --> 04:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
but also set a good example for the rest
 
04:23:16.389 --> 04:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
of New England on how to get energy
 
04:23:19.389 --> 04:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
policy done right um and also I believe
 
04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
that there was a question earlier about
 
04:23:23.990 --> 04:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
um nuclear coordinator position that is
 
04:23:25.870 --> 04:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
under the department um it's currently
 
04:23:28.189 --> 04:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
under the office of offshore wind
 
04:23:32.189 --> 04:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:34.750 --> 04:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
Innovation thank you questions for the
 
04:23:38.429 --> 04:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
uh Department representative Harrington
 
04:23:41.309 --> 04:23:41.319 align:start position:0%
yeah just a quick one on the that uh new
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
the nuclear development regulatory or
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that coordinator is called is
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
that an existing position or are you
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
planning on hire if this was passed
 
04:23:50.670 --> 04:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
would you hire a new person to fill that
 
04:23:53.349 --> 04:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
it is existing it's existing right now
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative McGee has a
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman my
 
04:24:00.309 --> 04:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
question goes to your first point I
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
believe in that you um asked us to take
 
04:24:06.109 --> 04:24:06.119 align:start position:0%
caution in making changes I guess to
 
04:24:09.790 --> 04:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
374f because it it looks like it's uh
 
04:24:11.469 --> 04:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
moving from its original intent could
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
you talk a little more about the intent
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
that you're concerned about preserving
 
04:24:16.000 --> 04:24:18.630 align:start position:0%
that you're concerned about preserving
take

04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.030 --> 04:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question um again
 
04:24:24.550 --> 04:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
Matt Young For the record um so the
 
04:24:26.590 --> 04:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
intent of the uh restructuring policy
 
04:24:28.510 --> 04:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
principles um that are included in this
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
statute was to uh divest utilities from
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
Generation Um and then obviously 374 G
 
04:24:38.070 --> 04:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
represents a sort of a carve out I guess
 
04:24:41.429 --> 04:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
to that um so any expansion of that 374
 
04:24:41.439 --> 04:24:43.590 align:start position:0%
to that um so any expansion of that 374
G

04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
G
 
04:24:46.510 --> 04:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
um language or uh projects that could be
 
04:24:49.950 --> 04:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
included within that framework uh would
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh could be viewed as sort of diverging
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
from that um divesture goal of
 
04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
restructuring thank
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
 
04:25:01.630 --> 04:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
04:25:03.630 --> 04:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
coming in today um I have a similar
 
04:25:07.469 --> 04:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
question and that is uh concerning the
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
the uh issue you raised with stranded
 
04:25:10.710 --> 04:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
costs and some of the concerns you might
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
have about stranded costs because we
 
04:25:14.510 --> 04:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
know that is an issue that has plagued
 
04:25:16.750 --> 04:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know previous iterations of
 
04:25:19.349 --> 04:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy in our state um and
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so could you talk a little bit
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
more about specifically what would lead
 
04:25:26.590 --> 04:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
to those kind of stranded costs in
 
04:25:31.910 --> 04:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.149 --> 04:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
installations so under the uh 374 G
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
framework um these projects are approved
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
in a uh
 
04:25:43.830 --> 04:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
two-phase uh approach so first the um
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
the utilities um request for uh
 
04:25:49.309 --> 04:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
authorization from the from the Public
 
04:25:52.149 --> 04:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to um kind of get
 
04:25:53.550 --> 04:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
underway with these projects and they
 
04:25:54.910 --> 04:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
find that whether they're in the public
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
interest and then phase two of that once
 
04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
they're built the utilities come in um
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
and will present all their costs in a
 
04:26:06.109 --> 04:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
rate case and the those um costs are
 
04:26:08.189 --> 04:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
determined whether it be prudent or not
 
04:26:10.830 --> 04:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
in that second phase I hope that I hope
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
 
04:26:16.429 --> 04:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead I I was hoping to get
 
04:26:19.309 --> 04:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
more specificity around what leads to
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
those stranded cost issues why would why
 
04:26:25.269 --> 04:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
would a utility or or any operator of a
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
nuclear installation come in that second
 
04:26:29.910 --> 04:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
phase and claim stranded costs what
 
04:26:32.590 --> 04:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
would those stranded costs consist
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
of um you know I think the utilities
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
could speak to what what could become a
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
stranded cost I think what what would
 
04:26:41.830 --> 04:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
end up becoming stranded costs are any
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
any cost deemed imprudent um the the
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
utilities would have to cover those um
 
04:26:47.520 --> 04:26:48.950 align:start position:0%
utilities would have to cover those um
but

04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.070 --> 04:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
question representative McGee thank you
 
04:26:59.149 --> 04:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
question so my question would be um
 
04:27:05.469 --> 04:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
where the authority rests for nuclear
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
power currently coming into the state
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
because I think when C Brook came it was
 
04:27:11.910 --> 04:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
really a federal project and there might
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
have been citing concerns and local
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
coordination but does the Public
 
04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission under existing New
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute currently have
 
04:27:22.510 --> 04:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
oversite for nuclear power in any way or
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
is that would that be something that
 
04:27:25.750 --> 04:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
would need to be rectified because I
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think it's in their
 
04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
purview is it there's certainly federal
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
regulations and federal oversight I'm
 
04:27:32.950 --> 04:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
not entirely clear I'd have to go back
 
04:27:34.670 --> 04:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
and check on uh the site evaluation
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:43.229 --> 04:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
but follow up so then without changes to
 
04:27:45.630 --> 04:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
statute it may be true that they
 
04:27:49.710 --> 04:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any um statutory oversight
 
04:27:51.510 --> 04:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
for something like nuclear power coming
 
04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
into the state
 
04:27:55.630 --> 04:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
correct I'd have to go back and look at
 
04:27:58.830 --> 04:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:01.469 --> 04:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
clear further
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:28:05.790 --> 04:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah just to follow up to
 
04:28:08.189 --> 04:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
that question would this is kind of like
 
04:28:11.750 --> 04:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
piggybacking on the the distributed uh
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
elect electricity that we already
 
04:28:15.710 --> 04:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
allowed the utilities to buy IE the five
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
megawatt plant down in Kingston I guess
 
04:28:20.429 --> 04:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
so whatever regulations there that the
 
04:28:23.630 --> 04:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
Pu possessed in order to economically
 
04:28:25.630 --> 04:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
regulate a plant it wouldn't make any
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
difference whether it was one of under
 
04:28:29.109 --> 04:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
that provision or was under this new
 
04:28:31.229 --> 04:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear provision correct I
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
think the provisions are already in the
 
04:28:34.870 --> 04:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
financial regulation is already in the
 
04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
law could you say could you say that a
 
04:28:43.109 --> 04:28:43.119 align:start position:0%
different way maybe not sure I I'm sorry
 
04:28:44.990 --> 04:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
right now the the law says you can build
 
04:28:46.590 --> 04:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
distributive generation or renewable
 
04:28:50.109 --> 04:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
generation up to 6% of the utility Total
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
distribution Peak and someone stated
 
04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
earlier that they that would have that
 
04:28:56.590 --> 04:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
project that's being currently built
 
04:28:57.990 --> 04:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
would have to go through the Pu and
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
they'd have to show that the costs were
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable what we've done
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
under this bill is to expand that to
 
04:29:06.750 --> 04:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
include these Advanced nuclear reactors
 
04:29:09.309 --> 04:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
so am I correct in assuming that
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
whatever economic regulation that would
 
04:29:13.469 --> 04:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
app already is in the law for the
 
04:29:15.550 --> 04:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
distributed generation would now apply
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
to Advanced nuclear reactors and in fact
 
04:29:21.790 --> 04:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
the Pu would have Financial regulatory
 
04:29:24.590 --> 04:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
Authority so 374 G does include
 
04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
considerations and factors that the
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
commission does have to consider when
 
04:29:30.630 --> 04:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
improving these projects um and those
 
04:29:32.670 --> 04:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
those would apply under this legislation
 
04:29:37.309 --> 04:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
to um I guess any any anr projects okay
 
04:29:37.319 --> 04:29:38.550 align:start position:0%
to um I guess any any anr projects okay
thank

04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:29:42.910 --> 04:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
you further questions
 
04:29:44.710 --> 04:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none want to thank you two for
 
04:29:47.229 --> 04:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
being here next we'll call up Molly
 
04:29:50.349 --> 04:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
Connors from New
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
England um power generators
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
Association I think I recognize you
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
haven't I seen you here
 
04:30:01.550 --> 04:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
before coming a frequent flyer thank you
 
04:30:04.349 --> 04:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
all it's nice to see you all again um
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
for the record Molly Connor with NEPA
 
04:30:07.630 --> 04:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
the New England power generators
 
04:30:10.109 --> 04:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
Association as a reminder we represent
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
the non-utility owned gener facilities
 
04:30:15.109 --> 04:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
in the region um region wide we
 
04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
represent about 27,000 megawatt of
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
generating capacity and in New Hampshire
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
about 4,300 uh megawatts of generating
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
capacity um first off we want to
 
04:30:28.349 --> 04:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
underscore that we understand that
 
04:30:30.670 --> 04:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
consumers in New Hampshire and in the
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
region throughout New England are
 
04:30:35.630 --> 04:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
struggling with costs right now and we
 
04:30:37.469 --> 04:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
also know that there is growing concern
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
regarding reliability and the resource
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
mix in the region Our concern is that
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 710 May well very well
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
exacerbate these issues and not
 
04:30:48.239 --> 04:30:49.469 align:start position:0%
exacerbate these issues and not
alleviate

04:30:49.469 --> 04:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
alleviate
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
them and we say this recognizing the
 
04:30:54.349 --> 04:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
really exciting possibilities and
 
04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
potential that advanced nuclear offers
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
and we understand the excitement that
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
some people have about it however House
 
04:31:03.710 --> 04:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 710 would put New Hampshire's
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
consumers at Great risk for cost
 
04:31:09.309 --> 04:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
overruns this is an emerging technology
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
and again one that shows great promise
 
04:31:12.910 --> 04:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a technology that
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
currently would cost far more than what
 
04:31:18.269 --> 04:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
we see in wholesale electricity markets
 
04:31:20.189 --> 04:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
and the risk associated with whether or
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
not you should take the risk to invest
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
in it anyway really belongs with private
 
04:31:27.750 --> 04:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
investors who do this all the time and
 
04:31:30.149 --> 04:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
have that level of sophistication that
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
risk belongs with NE with them not with
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
captive rate paays it's really private
 
04:31:37.389 --> 04:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
investors that should take on the risks
 
04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
not the rate payers and allowing
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
utilities to take on their risk on
 
04:31:44.670 --> 04:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of their customers has the
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence I think of
 
04:31:48.910 --> 04:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
discouraging private investment why
 
04:31:50.429 --> 04:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
would you want to take on the risk to
 
04:31:52.349 --> 04:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
develop one of these if you know that
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
the local utility has that edge on you
 
04:31:57.149 --> 04:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of their financing and we also
 
04:31:59.309 --> 04:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
think it's a good moment to remember
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the consistent core goals
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the Department of energy State energy
 
04:32:06.030 --> 04:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
strategy say that government
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
intervention in energy markets should be
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
limited justifiable and Technology
 
04:32:11.279 --> 04:32:12.469 align:start position:0%
limited justifiable and Technology
neutral

04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
they should support a robust Market
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
selection of coste effective Energy
 
04:32:18.630 --> 04:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
Solutions and they should generate
 
04:32:20.950 --> 04:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
instate economic activity without
 
04:32:22.910 --> 04:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
Reliance on permanent subsid
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
subsidization of energy we think that
 
04:32:27.109 --> 04:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
there's wisdom in these goals we support
 
04:32:29.389 --> 04:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
these goals we share these goals and we
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
think that utility ownership of advanced
 
04:32:34.830 --> 04:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear power um is in conflict in in
 
04:32:37.469 --> 04:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
with these goals uh but recognizing the
 
04:32:38.990 --> 04:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
great excitement again that people have
 
04:32:40.750 --> 04:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
regarding this resource we encourage New
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire maybe to to revisit this
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
policy in a few years there are groups
 
04:32:47.109 --> 04:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
in other parts of the country and in
 
04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
Canada that are looking to do some pilot
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
projects with this maybe you can let
 
04:32:53.710 --> 04:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
them go first and learn from any
 
04:32:55.630 --> 04:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
mistakes and Lessons Learned I
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
questions okay questions for M
 
04:33:07.990 --> 04:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
Connor representative Corman thank you
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Miss Connor
 
04:33:12.109 --> 04:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's always good to see you um you
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned reliability you had concern
 
04:33:16.349 --> 04:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
about reliability but I didn't hear you
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
expand on that so this is your
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity oh I I you know I've been
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
following this committee for quite some
 
04:33:24.551 --> 04:33:24.561 align:start position:0%
time and I I and I've been in some of
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
your hearings where people say they're
 
04:33:27.629 --> 04:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
worried about where the resource mix is
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
going um we've made some comments along
 
04:33:31.949 --> 04:33:31.959 align:start position:0%
those lines too that we're seeing a
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
number of power plants that we rely on
 
04:33:36.750 --> 04:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
during peak hours ones that have stored
 
04:33:40.189 --> 04:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
fuel for example that are retiring and
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing that the um
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
emergence of their Replacements are not
 
04:33:46.750 --> 04:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
coming online as as quickly U because of
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
sighting issues and financing issues so
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
we see a lot of power plants retiring um
 
04:33:52.510 --> 04:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
but we don't see new power plants coming
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
on as quickly and there are a myriad of
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
issues around it but I think that's
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
really at the core of I think what
 
04:33:59.670 --> 04:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
people I know when I think about
 
04:34:01.070 --> 04:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
reliability that's one of the things I
 
04:34:03.230 --> 04:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
think about um but I think also people
 
04:34:04.750 --> 04:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
have other concerns but more the
 
04:34:06.429 --> 04:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
distribution level like storm resilience
 
04:34:07.949 --> 04:34:07.959 align:start position:0%
and things like
 
04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
that follow up thank you I'm sorry I
 
04:34:12.029 --> 04:34:12.039 align:start position:0%
still don't understand understand what
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's that has to do with utilities
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
owning Advanced nuclear oh um and so
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to say is I focused on
 
04:34:21.629 --> 04:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
the cost overruns largely because I
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
represent you uh generators that live
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
and die in the markets and so anything
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I focused on on the markets
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
in the financial aspect if you want
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
private investors to the reliability
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
question if you want to have private
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
investors putting their private Capital
 
04:34:40.429 --> 04:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire and New England they
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
should feel like they're is a Level
 
04:34:44.670 --> 04:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
Playing Field and if you allow utility
 
04:34:46.750 --> 04:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
ownership that could undermine some of
 
04:34:46.760 --> 04:34:49.670 align:start position:0%
ownership that could undermine some of
that

04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:51.551 --> 04:34:51.561 align:start position:0%
confidence why would you put all that
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
money on the line if you know that
 
04:34:55.269 --> 04:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
another utility could do that and have a
 
04:34:57.390 --> 04:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
a very steady uh Revenue
 
04:35:01.949 --> 04:35:01.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Miss
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
Connors thank
 
04:35:10.109 --> 04:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
you next up will be Michael Lata from
 
04:35:10.119 --> 04:35:20.470 align:start position:0%
you next up will be Michael Lata from
eversource

04:35:20.470 --> 04:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.480 --> 04:35:24.029 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:35:24.029 --> 04:35:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.910 --> 04:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon uh for the record
 
04:35:28.910 --> 04:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
Michael Lata representing eversource
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
energy thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
testify before you this
 
04:35:35.670 --> 04:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon um just want to share a few
 
04:35:38.109 --> 04:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts and comments on the bill uh
 
04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
first and foremost uh we definitely
 
04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsor's goal goal to
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
look at creative uh options to develop
 
04:35:48.269 --> 04:35:48.279 align:start position:0%
additional energy resources uh it's been
 
04:35:50.551 --> 04:35:50.561 align:start position:0%
long discussed uh projections of
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
increased load due to electrification as
 
04:35:56.750 --> 04:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
well as uh data centers driven by uh
 
04:35:59.109 --> 04:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence uh driving the
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
need for additional resources to meet
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
the that projected growth um just want
 
04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
to say straight off uh that eversource
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
has no plans to develop nuclear
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
Generation Um but we do report uh
 
04:36:14.109 --> 04:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
certainly as you've heard me testify in
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
the past uh efforts by the state to
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
increase electri increase energy Supply
 
04:36:24.709 --> 04:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh and improve affordability um as I
 
04:36:26.709 --> 04:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
think the committee is well aware uh
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
small modular reactor technology is at
 
04:36:32.429 --> 04:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
its very early stages of
 
04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
commercialization um and certainly
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's a long way to go before any of
 
04:36:41.189 --> 04:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
these uh uh generation resources would
 
04:36:41.199 --> 04:36:42.189 align:start position:0%
these uh uh generation resources would
be

04:36:42.189 --> 04:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:36:42.199 --> 04:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
be
uh

04:36:43.910 --> 04:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:46.869 --> 04:36:46.879 align:start position:0%
cost come down and cost to a point where
 
04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
it would be uh make sense for a utility
 
04:36:52.349 --> 04:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
to to do an investment uh in them uh as
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
has been pointed out I would just say
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
that any development by uh a utility to
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
use the authority under this bill um
 
04:37:04.750 --> 04:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
would have to get approval of the Public
 
04:37:08.750 --> 04:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission uh under the 374 G
 
04:37:11.869 --> 04:37:11.879 align:start position:0%
process which uh as noted previously is
 
04:37:13.750 --> 04:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
is a rather High bar and only one
 
04:37:16.269 --> 04:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
utility has been successful uh in
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
utilizing that authority to date uh and
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
as has been pointed out by the
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh that's somewhat
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
of a a
 
04:37:25.949 --> 04:37:25.959 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization uh then the project
 
04:37:27.990 --> 04:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be constructed and the
 
04:37:29.470 --> 04:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
utility would have to come back to the
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to seek cost
 
04:37:34.150 --> 04:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
recovery of the cost associated with
 
04:37:36.269 --> 04:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
that construction and presumably if
 
04:37:39.390 --> 04:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
there is a Delta between the estimated
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
costs uh prior to constru ction and the
 
04:37:45.269 --> 04:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
actual built costs uh those would be
 
04:37:48.029 --> 04:37:48.039 align:start position:0%
costs that are are uh at risk of being
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
found to be imprudent um the the real
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
thrust of uh my testimony was to
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
recommend if the committee is moving
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill uh to strike uh
 
04:38:01.869 --> 04:38:01.879 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill that would
 
04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
require utilities to offer um Advanced
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear rate options but uh I did hear
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
the the bill sponsor say that uh he
 
04:38:12.150 --> 04:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
intends to bring forth amendment to do
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
that we think that that would be very
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
helpful um Advanced nuclear uh options
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
are are certainly different than
 
04:38:21.429 --> 04:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
renewable options in terms of how
 
04:38:23.070 --> 04:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
utilities would be able to comply and
 
04:38:26.551 --> 04:38:26.561 align:start position:0%
procure that um with that I'd be happy
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions the committee
 
04:38:28.719 --> 04:38:30.709 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions the committee
may

04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
have questions for Mr Lata
 
04:38:33.760 --> 04:38:35.109 align:start position:0%
have questions for Mr Lata
representative

04:38:35.109 --> 04:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:37.629 --> 04:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:38:42.230 --> 04:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr LC so if the actual cost then
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
exceed those projected costs and the Pu
 
04:38:47.789 --> 04:38:47.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't approve those higher than
 
04:38:50.429 --> 04:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
expected costs do th does that then
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
become a stranded cost no that would be
 
04:38:56.830 --> 04:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh the utilities is at risk for
 
04:38:58.990 --> 04:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
disallowance of those costs they would
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
be found imprudent and the shareholders
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
would have to to make up that difference
 
04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
essentially the Pu would not be
 
04:39:05.869 --> 04:39:05.879 align:start position:0%
approving the cost recovery of those
 
04:39:09.910 --> 04:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:13.390 --> 04:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
expenses represent ative McGee thank you
 
04:39:15.551 --> 04:39:15.561 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr Lata my
 
04:39:17.310 --> 04:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
question is around the changes that
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
would uh sort of backtrack a bit on the
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
deregulation and the removal of
 
04:39:25.510 --> 04:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
utilities participating in this the
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
generation market so the question
 
04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
basically is what kind of an effect you
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
think it would have on the competitive
 
04:39:36.269 --> 04:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
Supply Market which I think is just sort
 
04:39:38.470 --> 04:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
of starting to get to a place where
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
competition is actually playing in the
 
04:39:40.718 --> 04:39:42.030 align:start position:0%
competition is actually playing in the
region

04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
region
 
04:39:45.270 --> 04:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh if if the utilities were allowed to
 
04:39:47.070 --> 04:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
invest in
 
04:39:53.070 --> 04:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh in more expensive uh forms of energy
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh and recover those monies or a good
 
04:39:57.868 --> 04:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
portion of them from the rate payer what
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
what kind of an effect do you think that
 
04:40:00.550 --> 04:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
would have on the competitive market
 
04:40:02.430 --> 04:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
which we were trying to initiate when we
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
passed deregulation sure I I I think it
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
would depend on
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
um the how the utility would
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
utilize the output of the generation and
 
04:40:17.470 --> 04:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
certainly when you had mentioned that it
 
04:40:20.628 --> 04:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
would be uh very expensive I I think a
 
04:40:23.948 --> 04:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
prudent utility would not propose
 
04:40:25.750 --> 04:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
something that would be uh more
 
04:40:28.868 --> 04:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
expensive and a uh you know
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
functioning uh Public Utilities
 
04:40:32.948 --> 04:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
Commission went ought approve the cost
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
recovery if it was um uneconomic uh but
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of how it might impact the
 
04:40:41.590 --> 04:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
competitive market if the utility were
 
04:40:45.070 --> 04:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
to uh to construct this they could use
 
04:40:47.590 --> 04:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
the output to serve uh their customers
 
04:40:49.868 --> 04:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
or they could use the output to Simply
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
bid into the competitive market and then
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
customers would receive the benefit of
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
the revenues of those sales so it it
 
04:40:58.230 --> 04:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
depends on how the utility were to
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
structure that and as was discussed on a
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
on your bill representative you know
 
04:41:07.070 --> 04:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
that uh the impacts of utility
 
04:41:08.948 --> 04:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
investments in distributed energy
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
resources is one criteria that the
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
commission uh has to consider when
 
04:41:17.510 --> 04:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
evaluating whether to approve um these
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
Investments follow up the followup
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
question would just be then where would
 
04:41:26.550 --> 04:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
we be in terms of deregulation if we did
 
04:41:29.190 --> 04:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
this because I I think the the exception
 
04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
that currently exists in law that's
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
referenced in this bill where uh where
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
renewable generation resides saying that
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's a benefit to having people
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
adding local sustainable energy which
 
04:41:43.550 --> 04:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
also has has no cost as it goes forward
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh the generation itself
 
04:41:49.628 --> 04:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
right so it provides uh a lower impact
 
04:41:53.948 --> 04:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
on costs um what does it do I guess I'm
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out what it does
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
to our attempt at deregulation it was
 
04:41:59.830 --> 04:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
the same point that the doe brought up
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
right they said this will kind of undo
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the regulation which is
 
04:42:07.150 --> 04:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
to deregulate the utilities from
 
04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
participating in large scale generation
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'll say
 
04:42:11.840 --> 04:42:14.030 align:start position:0%
I'll say
yeah

04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
certainly efforts and initiatives to
 
04:42:19.070 --> 04:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
allow utility ownership of
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
generation is a step back from Full
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
electric restructuring I think that's
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
just a fair statement thank
 
04:42:30.910 --> 04:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington thank you
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question there's
 
04:42:33.628 --> 04:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion here about
 
04:42:35.110 --> 04:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
relative risk and you know you were
 
04:42:37.350 --> 04:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
saying that if utility went to the Pu
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
and the costs weren't just and
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable that they wouldn't be
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for those costs which which
 
04:42:44.510 --> 04:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
of course is true but I think it's a
 
04:42:46.670 --> 04:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
little different with and we site for an
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
example let's say there's two projects
 
04:42:51.390 --> 04:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
being built they're both
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
smrs uh and for whatever crazy reason a
 
04:42:56.230 --> 04:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
small plane crashes into the
 
04:42:58.470 --> 04:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
construction project in both of them
 
04:43:00.510 --> 04:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
totally beyond the control of either the
 
04:43:02.430 --> 04:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
independent Builder or the utility
 
04:43:04.430 --> 04:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
building now the independent Builder is
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
going to eat 100% of their cost unless
 
04:43:08.350 --> 04:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
they have insurance for small plane
 
04:43:11.230 --> 04:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
crashes which I doubt they would uh on
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
the other hand if the utility was in
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
that situation they could go to the Pu
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
and said this was totally beyond our
 
04:43:19.310 --> 04:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
control we had no problem we had no way
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
of knowing this was going to happen and
 
04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
we should be reimbursed for those costs
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
isn't that the way the difference in
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
Risk is it's kind of an extreme example
 
04:43:30.510 --> 04:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
but so under
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
that very hypothetical situation um you
 
04:43:38.190 --> 04:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
know I I think it's the utility can try
 
04:43:40.708 --> 04:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
to recover those costs uh obviously we
 
04:43:40.718 --> 04:43:41.590 align:start position:0%
to recover those costs uh obviously we
have

04:43:41.590 --> 04:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
anti-ip law in New Hampshire that I
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
think would make it difficult for the
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
utility to do so but you know I can't
 
04:43:52.270 --> 04:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
speak for the details of you know follow
 
04:43:55.590 --> 04:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
that level of hypothetical yeah I'm this
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
would be after the fact it was built I'm
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
not talking
 
04:44:01.708 --> 04:44:01.718 align:start position:0%
about making the case my point is I'm
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get is there at least there is
 
04:44:06.390 --> 04:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
a a process with the utility could go
 
04:44:08.590 --> 04:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe recover some of their cost
 
04:44:11.110 --> 04:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
where the independent uh construct
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
dependent a builder of the generation
 
04:44:14.390 --> 04:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
would have no option whatsoever they
 
04:44:15.708 --> 04:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
would just have to eat the cost isn't
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
that correct I I I think that's fair the
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
utility would would likely seek to
 
04:44:24.910 --> 04:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.990 --> 04:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
costs representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
04:44:31.390 --> 04:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um and thank you for being
 
04:44:34.750 --> 04:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
here um so far we've we've done a dance
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
between pu doe State of New Hampshire
 
04:44:40.150 --> 04:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the utilities for development of
 
04:44:40.160 --> 04:44:41.590 align:start position:0%
and the utilities for development of
projects

04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:44:45.150 --> 04:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
no one has mentioned furk yet um furk I
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
mean no nuclear project can be developed
 
04:44:50.910 --> 04:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
without without FK saying so so how
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
would you imagine
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
FK and NRC oh I'm sorry NRC yeah how
 
04:45:01.230 --> 04:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
would you imagine they play into this
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
dance so very much appreciate the
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
question and I I'll do my best to
 
04:45:09.788 --> 04:45:09.798 align:start position:0%
respond uh you know with the asterisks
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm not a subject matter expert
 
04:45:15.470 --> 04:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
however um I I think what this bill is
 
04:45:18.190 --> 04:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with is essentially the cost
 
04:45:22.390 --> 04:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
recovery through um as a regulated
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
public utility of the construction of a
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
plant where entities like furk the NRC
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh would be involved in the the
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
licensing um if there's interstate
 
04:45:35.830 --> 04:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
commerce involved you know a
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
transmission play here uh FK would be
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
involved but really this is this bill is
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
focus on cost recovery of construction
 
04:45:46.350 --> 04:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
and then the treatment of the electric
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
output where there are other State uh
 
04:45:53.788 --> 04:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
entities like the site evaluation
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee and federal entities that
 
04:45:58.270 --> 04:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
would govern the the construction and
 
04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
operation of of the ENT of the um you
 
04:46:06.750 --> 04:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
know hypothetical small modular nuclear
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
reactor thank
 
04:46:12.310 --> 04:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
you other question
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you seeing none we'll
 
04:46:17.310 --> 04:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
give uh the last word to Nick cof of the
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
hey good afternoon um again I'm Nick cof
 
04:46:46.510 --> 04:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
of the conservation law Foundation
 
04:46:48.990 --> 04:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate being here today um so
 
04:46:50.670 --> 04:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation is neutral
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill um but I'm here today to
 
04:46:54.270 --> 04:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
offer some suggestions on possible
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
improvements to the bill um I've handed
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
out written comments which provide more
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
detail about what I'm going to talk
 
04:47:03.190 --> 04:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
about um now Advanced nuclear it may
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
present opportunities for the state um
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
but allowing utility ownership is a
 
04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
fairly of advanced nuclear is a L large
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
departure from the state's restructuring
 
04:47:16.990 --> 04:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
law um the overall purpose of the
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
restructuring law was to reduce costs
 
04:47:22.230 --> 04:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
for consumers by harnessing competitive
 
04:47:24.190 --> 04:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
markets um in pursuant to the
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
restructuring laws as has been mentioned
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
the utility sold off their um generation
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
assets and you know as has also been
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out there are currently only
 
04:47:37.070 --> 04:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
narrow exceptions under um you the
 
04:47:40.868 --> 04:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
state's public utility laws you know um
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
the restruction large preclusion of
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
utility ownership of generation
 
04:47:47.310 --> 04:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
facilities um including for de as we've
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
talked about now that exception is much
 
04:47:51.390 --> 04:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
narrower than what we're talking about
 
04:47:55.708 --> 04:47:55.718 align:start position:0%
here so for de 5 megawatts 6% of
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
utilities cumulative load um you know
 
04:48:01.030 --> 04:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is particularly for the facility
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
size this is much bigger so 90 megawatts
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
and 15% of utili cumulative load so it's
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
it's a much much larger um exception to
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
the um restructuring law in that sense
 
04:48:17.948 --> 04:48:17.958 align:start position:0%
um and it also creates a much bigger
 
04:48:19.070 --> 04:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
risk for rate
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
payers you as has been pointed out
 
04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
utility would seek to rate rate base
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
those costs for a nuclear facility
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
recover those costs from a rate payer or
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
from the rate payers um which would
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
create substantial risks for rate payers
 
04:48:35.230 --> 04:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
um you know and this is particularly a
 
04:48:36.548 --> 04:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
big concern given that we don't know
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
what anr will cost at this point in
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
time um so I mean so a couple thoughts
 
04:48:45.430 --> 04:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
on ways to improve the bill first off I
 
04:48:47.470 --> 04:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
think it would be better to reduce the
 
04:48:48.910 --> 04:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
the size that's in the bill you know the
 
04:48:52.270 --> 04:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
90 megawatt facility and and 15% um
 
04:48:54.510 --> 04:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
cumulative load thresholds that are in
 
04:48:56.788 --> 04:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
the bill um to make them more in line
 
04:48:58.830 --> 04:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
with the current exceptions for
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
de um and then another thing I want to
 
04:49:05.070 --> 04:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
point out is that the bill is very
 
04:49:08.350 --> 04:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
explicit in amending RSA
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
374 G4
 
04:49:14.510 --> 04:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
but it does not its current draft amend
 
04:49:18.350 --> 04:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 374 G5 which includes that the
 
04:49:21.628 --> 04:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
criteria for PC approval of
 
04:49:25.310 --> 04:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
deer um you know under the under the
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
current um under the current law under
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
G5 that just says de so the bill really
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
should amend RSA 374 G5 as well to make
 
04:49:38.750 --> 04:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
sure that those criteria apply to the
 
04:49:41.788 --> 04:49:41.798 align:start position:0%
apply to anr um
 
04:49:43.230 --> 04:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
but I also want to suggest an even
 
04:49:45.270 --> 04:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
better approach to utility
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
ownership um which would be utility
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
procurement of advanced nuclear
 
04:49:54.430 --> 04:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
resources so already under RSA
 
04:49:54.440 --> 04:49:56.070 align:start position:0%
resources so already under RSA
374

04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
374
 
04:50:00.270 --> 04:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
f11 um utilities are permitted to issue
 
04:50:02.030 --> 04:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
requests for
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
proposals um to procure energy from from
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
um you know various sources as long as
 
04:50:10.150 --> 04:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's new or incremental and I think even
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
under that existing language that would
 
04:50:15.150 --> 04:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
apply to advanc nuclear so you know as
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
as I read the current law already um you
 
04:50:20.390 --> 04:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
the utilities can issue an
 
04:50:22.590 --> 04:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
RFP which you know would would include
 
04:50:25.390 --> 04:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
resources from Advanced nuclear um and
 
04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
then relying on utility procurements
 
04:50:29.430 --> 04:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
instead of utility ownership that would
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
really accomplish many of the same
 
04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
purposes of this of this bill but
 
04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
substantially reduce risks to raid
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
payers um so that's really something for
 
04:50:38.548 --> 04:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider here and I
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
think you could accomplish that with
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
very very minimal you know if if any
 
04:50:45.868 --> 04:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
amendments to um RS RSA
 
04:50:51.190 --> 04:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
374 um f11 the procurement statute um so
 
04:50:52.948 --> 04:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
yeah and some you know I recommend
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
passes the bill only if um some of these
 
04:50:57.470 --> 04:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
changes are made and happy to take any
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you uh questions
 
04:51:07.270 --> 04:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr coff for taking my
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
so you you've come up with a sort of a
 
04:51:16.948 --> 04:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
workaround uh which addresses my earlier
 
04:51:19.390 --> 04:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
question about putting the utilities
 
04:51:21.628 --> 04:51:21.638 align:start position:0%
back in the generation business right so
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
that would be a way for them to
 
04:51:27.830 --> 04:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
procure uh available energy or make
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
people aware that they would be willing
 
04:51:32.190 --> 04:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
to procure that energy uh so it might
 
04:51:34.590 --> 04:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
solve the same problem but it would not
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
put the rate payers at risk is that what
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
you're yeah I correct I mean there' be
 
04:51:40.628 --> 04:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
substantially less risk I mean there's
 
04:51:42.190 --> 04:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
some risk for procurement because you
 
04:51:43.750 --> 04:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
basically have a long-term contract
 
04:51:45.788 --> 04:51:45.798 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to purchase you know
 
04:51:47.670 --> 04:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
energy for X number of years and so that
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
does create some risk but you don't have
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
the same level of risk as you do with
 
04:51:53.750 --> 04:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
ownership which you know if if the you
 
04:51:55.868 --> 04:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
know if there's cost overruns basically
 
04:51:59.548 --> 04:51:59.558 align:start position:0%
rate pairs on the hook for that um
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah appreciate
 
04:52:03.948 --> 04:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
it representative Harrington has a
 
04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
question yeah just follow up on that
 
04:52:09.310 --> 04:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
issue um let's just say for whatever
 
04:52:11.310 --> 04:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
reason somehow it's 10 years from now
 
04:52:13.310 --> 04:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
and someone builds a nuclear reactor a
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
new one in New Hampshire SMR at 150
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
megaw is there anything in the law that
 
04:52:21.390 --> 04:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
would prohibit any new uh New Hampshire
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
utilities from negotiating a PPA with
 
04:52:26.788 --> 04:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
that uh particular company if indeed it
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
was a good deal and they could bring it
 
04:52:31.868 --> 04:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
to the Pu and the Pu approved it um I
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
mean I I don't think so I mean I think
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
RSA 374 f11 allows that you know
 
04:52:38.350 --> 04:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
provides that Authority I would note
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
that with that existing statute set to
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
sunset in um June of this year so you
 
04:52:45.788 --> 04:52:45.798 align:start position:0%
may wish to amend that you know push
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
that push that date out but um yeah I
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
mean generally procurements have been
 
04:52:50.670 --> 04:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
allowed in the past and you know that's
 
04:52:52.910 --> 04:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
something that U many utilities do in
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
other states okay follow up followup
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess my point I'm going to try
 
04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
to get across here whether it was a a
 
04:53:03.628 --> 04:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
gas fired plant a offshore wind plant a
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
uh to onshore wind um or a nuclear plant
 
04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
the utility has the ability to go out
 
04:53:12.150 --> 04:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
and negotiate a PPA that's in the best
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
interest of the customers they don't
 
04:53:15.628 --> 04:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
need any additional leg legislation to
 
04:53:17.750 --> 04:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
do that do they yeah absolutely okay
 
04:53:17.760 --> 04:53:19.868 align:start position:0%
do that do they yeah absolutely okay
thank

04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Wendy
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:53:25.948 --> 04:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
for being
 
04:53:29.590 --> 04:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
here uh okay I'm going to try to set up
 
04:53:32.110 --> 04:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
this scenario if if utilities are
 
04:53:35.310 --> 04:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to procure their their energy
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
from these nuclear um
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
facilities might that lead to many large
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
nuclear facilities located in New
 
04:53:50.270 --> 04:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for profit obviously and if so
 
04:53:53.190 --> 04:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
are there any concerns about the number
 
04:53:55.590 --> 04:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
of nuclear facilities that could result
 
04:53:57.150 --> 04:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
because of this should there be
 
04:53:59.708 --> 04:53:59.718 align:start position:0%
restrictions or something like that I
 
04:54:00.868 --> 04:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
mean are you saying that this is going
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
to encourage more you know more um
 
04:54:06.390 --> 04:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
Advanced nuclear facilities being cited
 
04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
here is that is that the question that's
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
my concern that's your concern yes um I
 
04:54:13.430 --> 04:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
I certainly think you know it could
 
04:54:15.628 --> 04:54:15.638 align:start position:0%
happen at some point I mean as as ever
 
04:54:18.030 --> 04:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
sources said um you know they don't have
 
04:54:20.830 --> 04:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
any plans to develop um Advanced nuclear
 
04:54:22.830 --> 04:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time but I mean I think
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know depending on circumstances
 
04:54:25.868 --> 04:54:25.878 align:start position:0%
there there could be an effort to site
 
04:54:29.750 --> 04:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
more anr anr here in the future sure
 
04:54:29.760 --> 04:54:32.590 align:start position:0%
more anr anr here in the future sure
thank

04:54:32.590 --> 04:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:35.230 --> 04:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions I
 
04:54:36.548 --> 04:54:36.558 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr
 
04:54:38.788 --> 04:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
crov and I'm going to close the public
 
04:54:43.708 --> 04:54:43.718 align:start position:0%
hearing on H H b710 FN and immediately
 
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
we'll open in a public hearing on HB 764
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
FN and I'll call Representative Kelly
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
Penza to introduce this legislation to
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
us a question for the chair if I could
 
04:54:58.270 --> 04:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative parshall thank you so
 
04:54:59.948 --> 04:54:59.958 align:start position:0%
much do we have numbers for the online
 
04:55:02.350 --> 04:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
testimony submissions on that last
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill I'll ask representative PL if he
 
04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.990 --> 04:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representative prenza
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
welcome back thank you Mr chair um for
 
04:55:22.350 --> 04:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
the record uh representative Kelly Penza
 
04:55:23.670 --> 04:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
straford District
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
19 um I'm here today to introduce um HB
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
764 uh I hope you've all received the
 
04:55:38.230 --> 04:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
amendment um I put this amendment in I
 
04:55:39.990 --> 04:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't know week and a half two weeks ago
 
04:55:42.190 --> 04:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
after I saw the fiscal note that came
 
04:55:45.590 --> 04:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
back um so that it has literally the
 
04:55:48.590 --> 04:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill has changed so it has cut out um
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
that entire portion of the bill um which
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
makes this uh definitely easier and more
 
04:55:59.350 --> 04:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
palatable to everyone um we had a bill
 
04:56:01.110 --> 04:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
that was introduced uh I was a
 
04:56:06.070 --> 04:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of last session and um it was
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
very extensive this bill is is pretty
 
04:56:13.230 --> 04:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
much quite simple it does um it does a
 
04:56:15.750 --> 04:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
couple different things so currently
 
04:56:17.750 --> 04:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
which um you should have received this
 
04:56:22.030 --> 04:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
as well chapter 12f which is a current
 
04:56:25.150 --> 04:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
statute has a weather modification
 
04:56:27.788 --> 04:56:27.798 align:start position:0%
experimentation um statute it's called
 
04:56:31.948 --> 04:56:31.958 align:start position:0%
12f so it repeals 12f and it puts the
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
most important part of
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
12f which uh representative Judy Aon had
 
04:56:42.510 --> 04:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
done an amendment to in um in 2021 and
 
04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
it puts it into um its own kind of uh
 
04:56:48.750 --> 04:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
part of this bill where it actually
 
04:56:52.708 --> 04:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
prohibits Geon jering um in case of of
 
04:56:55.470 --> 04:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
course there was severe drought um and
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
then there would be um you know a
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
declaration of a national emergency or a
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide emergency and then of course
 
04:57:04.868 --> 04:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
the governor would have um access to be
 
04:57:06.548 --> 04:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
able to do that if we were in that
 
04:57:09.230 --> 04:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
severe and it gives all the steps um
 
04:57:11.750 --> 04:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
which are similar to of what's in this
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
chapter 12f about what would take place
 
04:57:16.788 --> 04:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
if we did uh fall into a severe drought
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
and we needed to um have cloud seating
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
efforts in New
 
04:57:24.670 --> 04:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the other part of the bill is
 
04:57:28.510 --> 04:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
basically um prohibiting uh
 
04:57:30.510 --> 04:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
geoengineering weather
 
04:57:30.520 --> 04:57:32.270 align:start position:0%
geoengineering weather
modification

04:57:32.270 --> 04:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
modification
 
04:57:36.030 --> 04:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
um the terms Sai and SRM which is solar
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
radiation modification and Strat uh
 
04:57:40.750 --> 04:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
stratospheric air
 
04:57:44.190 --> 04:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
injection um and that we're Banning um
 
04:57:48.190 --> 04:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
in a sense or prohibiting those um those
 
04:57:52.510 --> 04:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire there last year I
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
gave unbelievable amounts of follow-up
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
testimony uh 12-page document that took
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
me hundreds of hours going back I only
 
04:58:05.628 --> 04:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
went actually back to um 1965 I could
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
have gone back to the 1930s that talked
 
04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
about um all different levels of
 
04:58:13.708 --> 04:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
administrations that have been involved
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
in this um how it's been a global effort
 
04:58:20.590 --> 04:58:20.600 align:start position:0%
from the UN to um you know the um the
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
weather Enterprise and all of this and
 
04:58:26.070 --> 04:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
so just so we could have some background
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
on this um on this whole topic
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
um folks in New Hampshire have not
 
04:58:36.750 --> 04:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
consented to this um and the piece of
 
04:58:39.548 --> 04:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
the bill here where it has a involvement
 
04:58:39.558 --> 04:58:40.670 align:start position:0%
the bill here where it has a involvement
of

04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:58:43.750 --> 04:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
now would be um and I can show you the
 
04:58:46.990 --> 04:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
document that has about 35 different
 
04:58:49.750 --> 04:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
federal agencies um that would be
 
04:58:52.150 --> 04:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
notified and I have all of the
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
background um facts from all the
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
different government set websites but
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
these are all of the ones right now it's
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
on line on the uh Amendment page two
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
line 30 all the way to um line
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
um 37 and then on page three line one to
 
04:59:16.030 --> 04:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
line 17 that would be contacted if this
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
bill uh is fortunate enough to um make
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
it to the end and um that they would be
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
contacted that New Hampshire prohibits
 
04:59:27.628 --> 04:59:27.638 align:start position:0%
this uh type of weather um
 
04:59:31.868 --> 04:59:31.878 align:start position:0%
modification and that's pretty much
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
um the whole bill at this point there is
 
04:59:37.628 --> 04:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
um there really shouldn't be uh a fiscal
 
04:59:41.070 --> 04:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
note on it um because of the Amendment
 
04:59:43.230 --> 04:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:59:46.910 --> 04:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
and uh part of the there was a concern
 
04:59:49.750 --> 04:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
about the cloud seating piece and and
 
04:59:51.788 --> 04:59:51.798 align:start position:0%
the that was the biggest concern that I
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
um that I received um from fellow
 
04:59:56.030 --> 04:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives fellow co-sponsors of
 
04:59:58.910 --> 04:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
the bill and so we took care of that
 
05:00:01.868 --> 05:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
specifically in all of the text here uh
 
05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
in regards if there was any sort of
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
State emergency and um I'm open up for
 
05:00:10.110 --> 05:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
 
05:00:12.718 --> 05:00:13.670 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing
that

05:00:13.670 --> 05:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
legislation questions for representative
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
patena representative
 
05:00:20.708 --> 05:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:00:22.230 --> 05:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I've just I'm
 
05:00:24.788 --> 05:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
looking on page two of the bill on line
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
29 maybe I'm just missing something here
 
05:00:30.030 --> 05:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
but it says and the penalties for
 
05:00:31.830 --> 05:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
violating such
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
prohibitions where do I find the
 
05:00:37.310 --> 05:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
penalties there's no penalties are you
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
in the do you have the amendment I have
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh
 
05:00:44.110 --> 05:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
page two line 29 stats geoengineering is
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited and the penalties for
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
violating such prohibitions and I'm
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
trying to find where the penalties are
 
05:00:52.510 --> 05:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill I
 
05:00:57.310 --> 05:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
don't line 29 page two oh page two yeah
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
right before he starts listing all the
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
agencies that's just a mistake from from
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
OS that it just needs to be wiped out of
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
there there are no there are no
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
penalties so all right so that cles out
 
05:01:13.708 --> 05:01:13.718 align:start position:0%
that's they they removed everything that
 
05:01:16.788 --> 05:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
was in front of that so that's why all
 
05:01:18.788 --> 05:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
right thank you she just that would be
 
05:01:21.830 --> 05:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
um that would be taken out so basically
 
05:01:23.070 --> 05:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
it should it should read the
 
05:01:23.948 --> 05:01:23.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services shall within 30
 
05:01:26.910 --> 05:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
days of the effective date of the
 
05:01:28.830 --> 05:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
section provide notice to the following
 
05:01:30.628 --> 05:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
entities that geoengineering is
 
05:01:33.270 --> 05:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited in New Hampshire bam and then
 
05:01:36.270 --> 05:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
it would go 30 to 37 and then on page
 
05:01:43.990 --> 05:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:53.270 --> 05:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions well seeing none I guess I'll
 
05:01:54.990 --> 05:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for introducing this
 
05:01:55.000 --> 05:01:56.670 align:start position:0%
thank you for introducing this
representative

05:01:56.670 --> 05:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:02:00.470 --> 05:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
PL thank you chair thank you represent
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
Pensa reading this
 
05:02:05.150 --> 05:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
over it says the
 
05:02:07.670 --> 05:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
state well you already read
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
it considering
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
these alleged chemicals dispersions of
 
05:02:18.548 --> 05:02:18.558 align:start position:0%
materials all you're asking or
 
05:02:21.070 --> 05:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
telling I got to put this in a
 
05:02:24.948 --> 05:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
question what benefit would it have to
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
us if it's being done now to allow these
 
05:02:31.390 --> 05:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
chemicals or any chemicals to be
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
dispersed what is the a positive reason
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's actually no positive reason and
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
if uh if this committee would like
 
05:02:40.990 --> 05:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
because of of course there's new
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives on this committee I'd be
 
05:02:46.708 --> 05:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
happy to submit um the 12-page document
 
05:02:49.070 --> 05:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
that I had put together I could cut out
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
specifically um those uh those chemicals
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
from and I can read them off here um
 
05:02:58.910 --> 05:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
that cause a lot of problems respiratory
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
problems um so from aluminum to sulfur
 
05:03:03.910 --> 05:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
oxide there's a whole slew of them that
 
05:03:06.990 --> 05:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
cause um some problems we have had some
 
05:03:09.788 --> 05:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
private citizens and uh I've received
 
05:03:12.030 --> 05:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
that have done this on their own and um
 
05:03:16.030 --> 05:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
where they have tested um the rainwater
 
05:03:18.990 --> 05:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
um in local labs for you know some of
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
these um entities that wouldn't be from
 
05:03:27.070 --> 05:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
um acid rain and um so a gentleman in
 
05:03:31.110 --> 05:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
Salem and a Gentleman up North so but
 
05:03:33.070 --> 05:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
those of course are anecdotal or
 
05:03:35.750 --> 05:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
whatever but um and I also should also
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
say that um Tennessee has passed similar
 
05:03:39.040 --> 05:03:40.350 align:start position:0%
say that um Tennessee has passed similar
legislation

05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:03:43.470 --> 05:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
and uh they did that last year as well
 
05:03:46.510 --> 05:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
as Florida is very close right now um to
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
thing okay further questions
 
05:03:55.310 --> 05:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
Venza for coming back with the an
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
improved Bill and it looks like you've
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know tried to work through all the
 
05:04:06.110 --> 05:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
issues my question uh has to do with
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's a number of references to the
 
05:04:09.030 --> 05:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
05:04:11.190 --> 05:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
I see a representative from Dees here
 
05:04:14.270 --> 05:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
today did you speak with Dees about any
 
05:04:15.948 --> 05:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
of the conclusions that you've made here
 
05:04:18.750 --> 05:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
or any of the activities that you will
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
be asking them to undertake during the
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
you know the research for the bill I
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
have um and he's going and he's here he
 
05:04:30.110 --> 05:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
has the amended version of it um you
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
know their concern was
 
05:04:37.390 --> 05:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
um when it was in its previous version
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
was the tracking or the tracing and of
 
05:04:42.070 --> 05:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
that and and of course a big huge line
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
item um monetarily as well so that has
 
05:04:49.070 --> 05:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
all been removed um it's very easy for
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
the Department to send a certified
 
05:04:53.750 --> 05:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
letter to those government agencies and
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's all we're asking for at this
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
point is a
 
05:04:59.470 --> 05:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
notice a notice basically saying New
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has passed this law
 
05:05:06.910 --> 05:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
followup follow up I think he has to
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
approve the followup but thank you um so
 
05:05:15.510 --> 05:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
on page two section three line 15 it
 
05:05:16.868 --> 05:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
says the Department of Environmental
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
Services shall maintain oversight of all
 
05:05:20.270 --> 05:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding activities to ensure
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
compliance with regulations and to
 
05:05:23.350 --> 05:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
assess the effectiveness of cloud
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
seeding operations that sounds like more
 
05:05:27.070 --> 05:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
than just sending a letter it sounds
 
05:05:29.628 --> 05:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
like they actually have to have no
 
05:05:31.868 --> 05:05:31.878 align:start position:0%
that's that has to do with uh the if
 
05:05:33.390 --> 05:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency and cloud seating
 
05:05:35.948 --> 05:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
is necessary okay that doesn't have
 
05:05:37.990 --> 05:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
anything to do that has to do with
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
basically taking 12 F and putting it
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
into the declared state of emergency if
 
05:05:46.270 --> 05:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
there's a catastrophic drought that has
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
everything to do with that which they
 
05:05:50.270 --> 05:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
would be part of if we needed to have
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
cloud seating it doesn't have anything
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
to do with
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
the so that L that line I'm referring to
 
05:05:59.830 --> 05:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
is section three and that you're saying
 
05:06:03.830 --> 05:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that's under a state of emergency
 
05:06:09.110 --> 05:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
piece yes if you if you read 125 c23
 
05:06:10.470 --> 05:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
exception for cloud seaing weather
 
05:06:12.670 --> 05:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
modification in caseine of of
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
catastrophic drought you have one a b c
 
05:06:18.548 --> 05:06:18.558 align:start position:0%
and d two and then you have three okay
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:25.030 --> 05:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
cool okay additional questions Vice
 
05:06:27.788 --> 05:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas as one thank you Mr chair
 
05:06:30.150 --> 05:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so just
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be clear as I'm reading through your
 
05:06:37.470 --> 05:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh it appears that uh because
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
of what's on the first page of line
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
starting on uh line 30 that the
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
amendment basically says there will be
 
05:06:49.708 --> 05:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
no geoengineering activities weather
 
05:06:52.430 --> 05:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
modification cloud seeding aerosol
 
05:06:54.030 --> 05:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
injection none
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
whatsoever not that you're asking for
 
05:06:58.948 --> 05:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
permission um or anything it just says
 
05:07:01.510 --> 05:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
there'll be none and the only exception
 
05:07:04.830 --> 05:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
would be if it's uh catastrophic drought
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
declared by the governor by way of
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
several state agencies is is that the in
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
yes follow follow
 
05:07:24.990 --> 05:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
up and so um this basically says that
 
05:07:27.830 --> 05:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's no notification there uh this is
 
05:07:30.230 --> 05:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
not saying first you have to notify us
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
or first you have to get a permit or
 
05:07:35.548 --> 05:07:35.558 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's a straight um
 
05:07:38.110 --> 05:07:38.120 align:start position:0%
there is no other option the state would
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
have no choice if this bill if this
 
05:07:42.830 --> 05:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
amendment was a passed like this
 
05:07:46.350 --> 05:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
correct um correct but no one ever
 
05:07:49.750 --> 05:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
consented to um weather modification
 
05:07:53.230 --> 05:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
experimentation in section 12f and if
 
05:07:56.548 --> 05:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
that's something that um the state wants
 
05:07:59.070 --> 05:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
to do I mean our constitution our New
 
05:08:01.230 --> 05:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution uh as well as our
 
05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
US Constitution is very clear that you
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
need to have consent of the people um
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
before you're experimenting anything on
 
05:08:08.910 --> 05:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
them and we never gave that kind of
 
05:08:12.670 --> 05:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
consent so in regards with um exemption
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
for cloud seeding in a case of
 
05:08:18.430 --> 05:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
catastrophic drought as you can see um
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
that would be in an extreme uh
 
05:08:23.310 --> 05:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
circumstance and there is notification
 
05:08:27.190 --> 05:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
to all of um you know the entire State
 
05:08:29.670 --> 05:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
all of the constituents as well as then
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
the it's mon monitored of course from
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
05:08:36.510 --> 05:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
um you have to give consent before you
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
decide you're doing any sort of
 
05:08:40.190 --> 05:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
experimentation on anyone
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:45.628 --> 05:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
thanks additional questions
 
05:08:45.638 --> 05:08:46.788 align:start position:0%
thanks additional questions
representative

05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I just wanted to follow
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
up on this because as I read this now
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
and maybe I'm missing something but it
 
05:08:54.510 --> 05:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
it gives the prohibition there on the
 
05:08:57.430 --> 05:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one on line 30 no person
 
05:08:59.430 --> 05:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
shall engage in so forth so forth and so
 
05:09:02.110 --> 05:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
on so let's say I observe someone
 
05:09:04.110 --> 05:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
engaging in this or I take some test
 
05:09:06.110 --> 05:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
when I see oh there's somebody
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
depositing something out of the sky I
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
collect samples find out it's F somehow
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
qualifies under this as being illegal
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
there apparently then is nothing I can
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
do about it I just say I've documented
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
illegal working happenings but there's
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
no recourse so I don't understand what
 
05:09:23.400 --> 05:09:26.270 align:start position:0%
no recourse so I don't understand what
it

05:09:26.270 --> 05:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
accomplishes well it actually
 
05:09:31.070 --> 05:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
accomplishes a lot so first we are
 
05:09:34.708 --> 05:09:34.718 align:start position:0%
repealing something that gave that gave
 
05:09:36.750 --> 05:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh a state Authority when they never had
 
05:09:37.948 --> 05:09:37.958 align:start position:0%
the authority because they never had
 
05:09:39.948 --> 05:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
consent of the people so that's very
 
05:09:43.270 --> 05:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
important and two um in the new
 
05:09:44.590 --> 05:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
Administration in the federal
 
05:09:46.548 --> 05:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
Administration there's been a lot of
 
05:09:48.590 --> 05:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
discussion about this there's been a ton
 
05:09:51.070 --> 05:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
of media about it um we're most likely
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to see uh an executive order about
 
05:09:56.548 --> 05:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
this um coming down the pike this is
 
05:10:00.750 --> 05:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
these are federal agencies NOS um that
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to control so the bill
 
05:10:05.548 --> 05:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
that I proposed or that was proposed
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
last session um tried to get a way we
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
could track and people could um people
 
05:10:17.110 --> 05:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
could um you know whatever put in
 
05:10:18.548 --> 05:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
complaints and all of that and there
 
05:10:21.230 --> 05:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
just isn't a pathway and there isn't a
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
pathway for Dees to do it because it
 
05:10:25.070 --> 05:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
cost it'll cost a million dollars so
 
05:10:28.548 --> 05:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
this is step one this is um basically
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
repealing something that we never
 
05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
consented to saying that it and it's
 
05:10:34.548 --> 05:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
exactly the same bill just so you know
 
05:10:36.430 --> 05:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
in Tennessee There's No enforcement
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
mechanism it pretty much makes the
 
05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
statement that it's not allowed in our
 
05:10:43.548 --> 05:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
state and so that's where we're
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
basically putting the stake in the
 
05:10:46.548 --> 05:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
ground and we're saying that it's not
 
05:10:48.788 --> 05:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
allowed and all of those agencies are
 
05:10:51.310 --> 05:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
going to get notified that are known to
 
05:10:53.310 --> 05:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
do weather modification GE engineering
 
05:10:58.470 --> 05:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
SI SRM and it's it's step one and um
 
05:10:59.948 --> 05:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
because of what's going to be happening
 
05:11:01.948 --> 05:11:01.958 align:start position:0%
I on I believe within the next two
 
05:11:04.270 --> 05:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
months on the federal side I think it
 
05:11:06.310 --> 05:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
would be really good for New Hampshire
 
05:11:08.350 --> 05:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
to have this in place to say we don't
 
05:11:08.360 --> 05:11:13.270 align:start position:0%
to have this in place to say we don't
consent

05:11:13.270 --> 05:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.230 --> 05:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh Wendy Thomas thank you
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um and thank you for presenting
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
this bill um I just am trying to figure
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
out the timeline in on page two here so
 
05:11:29.470 --> 05:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
cloud seating is a is allowed if the
 
05:11:31.948 --> 05:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
governor establishes a state of
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
emergency and then on line 12 it says
 
05:11:37.430 --> 05:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
prior to cloud seeding you have to do
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
this whole thorough Environmental
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
review doesn't that defeat um declaring
 
05:11:46.750 --> 05:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency so so is it the
 
05:11:49.390 --> 05:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and then we go to a
 
05:11:51.830 --> 05:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
review or are they doing a constant
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
review prior to declaring a state of
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
emergency thank you so I I would have to
 
05:12:03.948 --> 05:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
say that this was done with the lawyer
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
in OS and it was specific so for example
 
05:12:10.708 --> 05:12:10.718 align:start position:0%
um there's a c catastrophic drought it's
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
not as if cloud seating would happen
 
05:12:15.390 --> 05:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
within you know 2 days from that the
 
05:12:17.788 --> 05:12:17.798 align:start position:0%
governor is not a scientist doesn't work
 
05:12:19.150 --> 05:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Environmental
 
05:12:21.390 --> 05:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
Services is not a hydrogeologist or any
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
of those things so they would say they
 
05:12:26.350 --> 05:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
would put forward an emergency saying
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
that we need cloud seating and then of
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
course the department would have to be
 
05:12:33.910 --> 05:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
able to provide the data that that's
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
this basically is telling the people the
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
state shall conduct a thorough
 
05:12:40.150 --> 05:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
environmental review assessing potential
 
05:12:41.830 --> 05:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
risks and benefits and ensuring that the
 
05:12:43.868 --> 05:12:43.878 align:start position:0%
activities will not result in harm to
 
05:12:45.390 --> 05:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
the environment public health or
 
05:12:50.670 --> 05:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
Wildlife that's part of it so the the um
 
05:12:52.190 --> 05:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency for a
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
catastrophic drought and saying that we
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
the governor believes that cloud seating
 
05:12:58.830 --> 05:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
is necessary there still has to be SE
 
05:13:00.750 --> 05:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
steps that would take place it's just
 
05:13:02.548 --> 05:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
like anything else it's not as if okay
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
take out the planes it's going to happen
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so this is just it's basically
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
a um an approach that involves not only
 
05:13:12.788 --> 05:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
the entity of the stakeholders of the
 
05:13:14.270 --> 05:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
state the Department of Environmental
 
05:13:16.750 --> 05:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
Services but also the consent of the
 
05:13:19.070 --> 05:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
people thank
 
05:13:22.510 --> 05:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:13:25.868 --> 05:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
representative patens to bringing this
 
05:13:28.708 --> 05:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
bill um I just have a concern about the
 
05:13:31.310 --> 05:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
the kind of the implicit notion behind
 
05:13:33.310 --> 05:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
this that that somehow the clouds in New
 
05:13:35.830 --> 05:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just stay right above us what
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
if this concept caught on and say the
 
05:13:40.708 --> 05:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont or the state of Maine
 
05:13:42.830 --> 05:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
declares an emergency drought and they
 
05:13:44.510 --> 05:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
want to seed their clouds but the clouds
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
are coming from the south or they're
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
coming from the East they would have to
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
fly over the state of New Hampshire to
 
05:13:51.670 --> 05:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
seed their clouds or or I mean is that
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.548 --> 05:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
foresee um maybe I I I don't know I'm
 
05:14:03.430 --> 05:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
most of the time when um cloud seating
 
05:14:09.230 --> 05:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
is happening it's not necessarily um
 
05:14:10.948 --> 05:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
so if you've ever if you ever watched a
 
05:14:13.708 --> 05:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
video of the planes that are doing that
 
05:14:15.628 --> 05:14:15.638 align:start position:0%
they're not like following clouds and
 
05:14:18.270 --> 05:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
doing it like that it's basically over a
 
05:14:20.830 --> 05:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
certain geographical area uh I can send
 
05:14:23.430 --> 05:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
you a wonderful video that was done in
 
05:14:26.190 --> 05:14:26.200 align:start position:0%
Colorado that shows that so it's it's
 
05:14:28.548 --> 05:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
specific around an area it's not as if
 
05:14:31.510 --> 05:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
they're following the clouds basically
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
when the um when the chemicals or
 
05:14:38.548 --> 05:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
whatever is released um it it creates a
 
05:14:41.470 --> 05:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
cloud cover it actually and then clouds
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
form around that you know um injection
 
05:14:51.990 --> 05:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:54.788 --> 05:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
atmosphere representative McGee thank
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
Penza for indulging me I went and looked
 
05:15:02.350 --> 05:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
up uh chapter F12 which is our current
 
05:15:04.110 --> 05:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
statute on weather modification
 
05:15:05.670 --> 05:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
experimentation which I know you're
 
05:15:08.590 --> 05:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
quite familiar with and I guess what my
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
concern is is uh the statute that we
 
05:15:14.190 --> 05:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
have on the books for weather
 
05:15:14.200 --> 05:15:15.948 align:start position:0%
have on the books for weather
modification

05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
modification
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
experimentation already talks about the
 
05:15:20.470 --> 05:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
Departments and the state and the
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
governor uh and the executive Council
 
05:15:23.440 --> 05:15:24.350 align:start position:0%
governor uh and the executive Council
being

05:15:24.350 --> 05:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:15:27.350 --> 05:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
involved um in any discussions around
 
05:15:30.230 --> 05:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
how to pay for or to undertake any type
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
of uh weather
 
05:15:35.590 --> 05:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
modification um that that might require
 
05:15:37.070 --> 05:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the federal government
 
05:15:38.350 --> 05:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
which is what we see in other states
 
05:15:41.948 --> 05:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
that we know um have had cloud seating
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
programs say to get rain for droughts
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
like out in California and that kind of
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
thing um and uh so the section one talks
 
05:15:54.030 --> 05:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
about that piece of sort of like who's
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
involved and these are all elected
 
05:15:56.670 --> 05:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
people so it's not like people don't
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
have any say because these are
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives we have a representative
 
05:16:03.310 --> 05:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
government but section two says that two
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
months prior to the presentation to the
 
05:16:06.430 --> 05:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
governor executive
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
Council uh for engagement in experiment
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
mention or
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
techniques um the department or agency
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
of State participating in such
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
engagement or experimentation shall do
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
the following and then they have public
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
notice in at least four papers which is
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
similar to language that you have in
 
05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
your bill so they're required to not
 
05:16:26.628 --> 05:16:26.638 align:start position:0%
only notify the public they're also
 
05:16:29.110 --> 05:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
required to disclose to the public the
 
05:16:30.868 --> 05:16:30.878 align:start position:0%
chemical compounds and technologies that
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
will be used in the proposed weather
 
05:16:34.708 --> 05:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
modification in the state and the
 
05:16:36.708 --> 05:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
effects of the programs or
 
05:16:39.270 --> 05:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
experimentations on human health
 
05:16:41.390 --> 05:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
Wildlife wildlife habitats that may be
 
05:16:43.548 --> 05:16:43.558 align:start position:0%
affected and the sources of funding to
 
05:16:46.190 --> 05:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
perform such programs so it sounds like
 
05:16:48.270 --> 05:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
the existing statute that you propose to
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate actually has a lot of valuable
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
things in it um It also says under C of
 
05:16:56.830 --> 05:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
that statute solicit public input
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
regarding the proposed weather
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
modification program or experimentation
 
05:17:02.910 --> 05:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand why you want to
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
eliminate this statute and you think
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
that this statute is preferable is it
 
05:17:09.910 --> 05:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
because it's a Prohibition
 
05:17:11.990 --> 05:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
um actually pretty much everything
 
05:17:14.628 --> 05:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
that's in that statute is in um my
 
05:17:17.310 --> 05:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment um because it's still it's
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:17:21.948 --> 05:17:21.958 align:start position:0%
no it there's no consent in here it's
 
05:17:24.590 --> 05:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
basically um and by the way it's never
 
05:17:27.350 --> 05:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
happened um so if there has been any
 
05:17:30.590 --> 05:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
sort of experimentation that's happened
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
um most people aren't even familiar with
 
05:17:35.910 --> 05:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
this statute I have talked to um my
 
05:17:37.830 --> 05:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
executive counselor actually and another
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
executive counselor that they're not
 
05:17:41.788 --> 05:17:41.798 align:start position:0%
they weren't even familiar with this at
 
05:17:44.990 --> 05:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
all it was kind of just done in placed
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
and only um representative Aaron um felt
 
05:17:52.350 --> 05:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
that she's the one that added those
 
05:17:54.150 --> 05:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
other notifications in there they didn't
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
they didn't have anything in there
 
05:17:57.670 --> 05:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
before and that was in
 
05:18:00.548 --> 05:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
2021 um the piece that's missing is
 
05:18:03.590 --> 05:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
consent and so um any department or
 
05:18:05.708 --> 05:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
agency of the state may with approval of
 
05:18:07.430 --> 05:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council and within the
 
05:18:09.830 --> 05:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
limits of funds blah blah blah basically
 
05:18:12.990 --> 05:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
says that you can do it and that's the
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's where um that's where the
 
05:18:18.430 --> 05:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
prohibition is coming in because of that
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
so if there is a need for um cloud
 
05:18:24.990 --> 05:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
seating in the case of and that's really
 
05:18:28.270 --> 05:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
the only piece of weather modification
 
05:18:32.190 --> 05:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
that would be something that is known
 
05:18:35.470 --> 05:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
um um it's a known entity it's been
 
05:18:39.150 --> 05:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
going on for decades and um in then it's
 
05:18:42.230 --> 05:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
included in here so yeah there doesn't
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
we never consented to be um guinea pigs
 
05:18:47.548 --> 05:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
for any sort of weather modification
 
05:18:50.230 --> 05:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's why this needs to be removed and
 
05:18:55.310 --> 05:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.548 --> 05:18:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:02.190 --> 05:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:19:09.548 --> 05:19:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:09.558 --> 05:19:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:19:10.830 --> 05:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:19:10.840 --> 05:19:13.350 align:start position:0%
the
question

05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
Banning experimentation cloud seeding
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
any dispersion over New Hampshire if it
 
05:19:21.350 --> 05:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
done is not
 
05:19:26.868 --> 05:19:26.878 align:start position:0%
in I don't want to use the
 
05:19:30.510 --> 05:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
opinion is the other New England states
 
05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
environment the same as New Hampshire
 
05:19:36.070 --> 05:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
that they can do it there it's not like
 
05:19:38.350 --> 05:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
they're stopping their experimentation
 
05:19:40.110 --> 05:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
just not over New
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah not every state and I can
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants to have that not
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
every state has um We're The Unlucky
 
05:19:50.948 --> 05:19:50.958 align:start position:0%
state that has a weather modification
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
experimentation uh statute uh I don't
 
05:19:56.990 --> 05:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
believe that Vermont does but um it
 
05:19:59.150 --> 05:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter like I said
 
05:20:01.470 --> 05:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
Tennessee passed it for Tennessee
 
05:20:04.070 --> 05:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
Florida's about to pass it for Florida
 
05:20:06.910 --> 05:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
if you know Vermont wants to perform
 
05:20:08.948 --> 05:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
weather modification experiments or
 
05:20:12.110 --> 05:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding or Maine or Massachusetts
 
05:20:15.030 --> 05:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
they're welcome to do it so um this is
 
05:20:17.310 --> 05:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
basically just saying um leave New
 
05:20:23.310 --> 05:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire B and um and there's not any
 
05:20:26.070 --> 05:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
um all of the all of the chemicals that
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
are in every bit of these um the
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
dispersements they're not all by plane
 
05:20:35.030 --> 05:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
they are by drone they are by uh
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
balloons they also are by ships that um
 
05:20:41.548 --> 05:20:41.558 align:start position:0%
eject them in there and I mean I I don't
 
05:20:42.670 --> 05:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
there's people that are on this
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
committee that should remember I mean I
 
05:20:47.910 --> 05:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
sent you um every bit of information
 
05:20:50.230 --> 05:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's been going on for a very very long
 
05:20:52.788 --> 05:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
time there's lots of concerns
 
05:20:55.350 --> 05:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
internationally um Mexico actually
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
banned this specifically um because they
 
05:21:01.470 --> 05:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
were letting off balloons to block the
 
05:21:05.990 --> 05:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
sun um and so this isn't you know this
 
05:21:08.830 --> 05:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
isn't some um madeup thing it's been
 
05:21:11.230 --> 05:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
going on for a long time in the 1930s
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
they used it in the military um to
 
05:21:16.350 --> 05:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
create because they knew um they could
 
05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
do that in Wartime situations and so
 
05:21:21.868 --> 05:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
we've had the technology for a long time
 
05:21:23.390 --> 05:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you guys are familiar
 
05:21:27.030 --> 05:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
with chaff um you can actually see chaff
 
05:21:29.670 --> 05:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
on um meteorologist notice but
 
05:21:32.150 --> 05:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
definitely out on the coast so uh it's
 
05:21:34.948 --> 05:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
very familiar in California for example
 
05:21:38.270 --> 05:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
um where it it looks very different so
 
05:21:41.070 --> 05:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
if you see if you're looking a um on a
 
05:21:43.230 --> 05:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
weather report and you can see the color
 
05:21:45.030 --> 05:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
they know because it's basically it's
 
05:21:47.070 --> 05:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
got heavy metals in it which is put on
 
05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
there that's a um chaff is a military
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
term I put that in my documentation so
 
05:21:54.190 --> 05:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff that's not good
 
05:21:55.868 --> 05:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
it's not good for the soil it's not good
 
05:21:57.628 --> 05:21:57.638 align:start position:0%
for people uh it's not good for
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
respiratory things it's not good for our
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
environment um you know I'm on
 
05:22:03.390 --> 05:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture I wish this
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
bill came to our committee um because I
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
think people are more aware of it there
 
05:22:10.628 --> 05:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
um I've been receiving messages from
 
05:22:12.910 --> 05:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
people all over the country um I have
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
talked to reps in South Carolina North
 
05:22:18.270 --> 05:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
Carolina New York all of these reps are
 
05:22:20.548 --> 05:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
putting in similar legislation and like
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
I said um the federal government right
 
05:22:26.030 --> 05:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
now is looking at this because they've
 
05:22:28.948 --> 05:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
they've um really um not paid attention
 
05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
to this and there's a lot of people
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
making a lot of money on on you know
 
05:22:35.628 --> 05:22:35.638 align:start position:0%
just trying to either whether it be
 
05:22:40.270 --> 05:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
block the Sun or um or create um certain
 
05:22:43.310 --> 05:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
weather episodes because everything goes
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
into um when we try to play God
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
everything goes into a certain thing you
 
05:22:50.270 --> 05:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
affect one thing there's a there's a
 
05:22:50.280 --> 05:22:51.628 align:start position:0%
affect one thing there's a there's a
there's

05:22:51.628 --> 05:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
a an effect a you know a triple down
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
effect or a trickle down effect for
 
05:22:58.868 --> 05:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
everything else and that's why I believe
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
that this is this is the way to do it uh
 
05:23:03.628 --> 05:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
it won't be a cost to anyone in the
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
state and um and since you know
 
05:23:09.430 --> 05:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
supposedly they haven't been doing other
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
modification experimentation um because
 
05:23:14.590 --> 05:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard of it um in regards
 
05:23:16.510 --> 05:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
with that there should be no problem in
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
passing this prohibition on it
 
05:23:19.628 --> 05:23:19.638 align:start position:0%
especially since we know it's going to
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
be coming from up top very soon in the
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
next couple
 
05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
months okay further
 
05:23:29.830 --> 05:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
05:23:31.628 --> 05:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this
 
05:23:33.990 --> 05:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislation let's hear next from New
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees I'll call on Mike
 
05:23:36.558 --> 05:23:42.948 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees I'll call on Mike
Fitzgerald

05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:47.548 --> 05:23:47.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:49.948 --> 05:23:49.958 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald members of the committee
 
05:23:51.868 --> 05:23:51.878 align:start position:0%
Michael Fitzgerald assistant director of
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
the air Resources Division Department of
 
05:23:53.600 --> 05:23:54.750 align:start position:0%
the air Resources Division Department of
Environmental

05:23:54.750 --> 05:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
05:23:56.430 --> 05:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
Services uh I want to thank
 
05:23:58.150 --> 05:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative Penza for reaching out to
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
us this afternoon and providing us with
 
05:24:02.510 --> 05:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
a copy of the amendment um so I will
 
05:24:06.350 --> 05:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
address most of my remarks to the uh to
 
05:24:08.670 --> 05:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
the potential Amendment uh assuming that
 
05:24:10.910 --> 05:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's um something that the committee
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
is going to consider uh we did provide a
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the original Bill and as
 
05:24:17.390 --> 05:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative poent indicated it would
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
have required significant resources so
 
05:24:24.390 --> 05:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
um uh in and I have only had the
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
amendment for an hour and I've had two
 
05:24:28.548 --> 05:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
other hearings that I've been in so uh
 
05:24:30.910 --> 05:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just just beginning to absorb it but
 
05:24:33.548 --> 05:24:33.558 align:start position:0%
uh um it does seem as representative
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
Penza stated to eliminate a significant
 
05:24:39.150 --> 05:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
amount of the the uh effort and
 
05:24:40.868 --> 05:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
resources that would have been required
 
05:24:43.510 --> 05:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the department in the original bill
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I do note that uh page as was noted
 
05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
previously page two line 12 does say the
 
05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
state shall conduct a thorough
 
05:24:53.868 --> 05:24:53.878 align:start position:0%
environmental review I'm not sure who
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
the state is what who would be
 
05:24:58.390 --> 05:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
responsible but I assume that would be
 
05:25:00.670 --> 05:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
something that the under this situation
 
05:25:00.680 --> 05:25:01.548 align:start position:0%
something that the under this situation
of

05:25:01.548 --> 05:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:25:04.350 --> 05:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
emergency um uh for allowing cloud
 
05:25:06.390 --> 05:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
seating that um the governor would make
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
some some sort of designation
 
05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know what kind of
 
05:25:12.910 --> 05:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
resources would be necessary to do that
 
05:25:14.470 --> 05:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
but it's not directed at at our
 
05:25:17.868 --> 05:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
department specifically so um I'm just
 
05:25:22.230 --> 05:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
just noting that um section three uh
 
05:25:25.990 --> 05:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
again I think it's rather unlikely um we
 
05:25:30.150 --> 05:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
don't see a lot of uh cloud seating to
 
05:25:33.628 --> 05:25:33.638 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge uh here I'm not
 
05:25:35.548 --> 05:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
addressing the other aspects that
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza uh bill the
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um we're addressing but uh
 
05:25:44.190 --> 05:25:44.200 align:start position:0%
cloud seating for weather modification
 
05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
um when and specifically to address
 
05:25:48.990 --> 05:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
drought um we're we're not aware of New
 
05:25:51.310 --> 05:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been in in serious drought
 
05:25:53.628 --> 05:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
conditions over the past several years a
 
05:25:55.948 --> 05:25:55.958 align:start position:0%
number of times there are specific
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
requirements I think it's in St RSA 485
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
but I'm not uh the drought expert that's
 
05:26:04.590 --> 05:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
our Water Division I'm I'm with the air
 
05:26:07.230 --> 05:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
division um there are some specific
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for the governor in in
 
05:26:14.030 --> 05:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
addressing draw emergencies and so on um
 
05:26:17.510 --> 05:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
so uh that uh should probably be be
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
looked at as well um as far as the
 
05:26:23.628 --> 05:26:23.638 align:start position:0%
notice of prohibition uh I don't see
 
05:26:25.390 --> 05:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
again representative penzo stated
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
correctly that it does not seem
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
particularly burdensome or honorous to
 
05:26:33.070 --> 05:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
us um it's just a matter of of uh draft
 
05:26:34.830 --> 05:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
drafting a letter and sending it out to
 
05:26:38.868 --> 05:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
the agencies required here so um
 
05:26:42.150 --> 05:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
I would note that uh uh this is an issue
 
05:26:44.270 --> 05:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
that is of concern to many citizens we
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
do get a lot of complaints um we do get
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of calls and concerns and um um
 
05:26:53.190 --> 05:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
again the department has no particular
 
05:26:55.350 --> 05:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
authority to address uh these types of
 
05:26:58.030 --> 05:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
emissions right now um but again and
 
05:27:02.270 --> 05:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
this this bill would not um uh put that
 
05:27:05.548 --> 05:27:05.558 align:start position:0%
Authority upon us uh the the amendment
 
05:27:07.590 --> 05:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
as I understand it would no longer put
 
05:27:08.910 --> 05:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
that upon us
 
05:27:11.990 --> 05:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh I think that's basically all of
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
my comments I'd be happy to address any
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh if
 
05:27:19.990 --> 05:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're and I also have uh Dave Healey
 
05:27:23.270 --> 05:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
with us who's our chief scientist and
 
05:27:25.230 --> 05:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
meteorologist um again we don't have a
 
05:27:26.830 --> 05:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
lot of familiarity with this type of
 
05:27:29.830 --> 05:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
work but um Dave is here and if there
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
are questions I might ask him to come up
 
05:27:34.788 --> 05:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
and answer help us I'm
 
05:27:38.910 --> 05:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
sorry okay questions for Mr Fitzgerald
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
Vice jar Thomas thank you Mr chairman
 
05:27:43.708 --> 05:27:43.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question more
 
05:27:45.948 --> 05:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
Curious and since you do have air in
 
05:27:47.868 --> 05:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
your name I'll ask you this uh this
 
05:27:51.390 --> 05:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
question how do you know what the
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
maximum altitude would be for cloud
 
05:27:57.230 --> 05:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
seeding to be effective at all and would
 
05:28:00.788 --> 05:28:00.798 align:start position:0%
that still be within the New Hampshire
 
05:28:03.628 --> 05:28:03.638 align:start position:0%
airspace uh well if you're referring to
 
05:28:06.830 --> 05:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
Aaron my name as Airhead maybe
 
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
then um but uh uh no I don't have any
 
05:28:12.230 --> 05:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
particular familiarity with cloud
 
05:28:15.390 --> 05:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
seeding procedures or or information
 
05:28:18.910 --> 05:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
again RSA 12f is is not specific to our
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
department um currently so um I I I we
 
05:28:25.788 --> 05:28:25.798 align:start position:0%
could certainly try to find some
 
05:28:27.270 --> 05:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
information and get back to you on it
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:33.708 --> 05:28:33.718 align:start position:0%
now representative Harrington has a
 
05:28:35.470 --> 05:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman than for
 
05:28:37.070 --> 05:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
take my question I guess uh you would
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
mention that you got a number of
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
complaints and phone calls on this I was
 
05:28:43.030 --> 05:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
wondering how would you deal with a law
 
05:28:45.310 --> 05:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
like this that says all this stuff is
 
05:28:46.830 --> 05:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited and then they're going to say
 
05:28:48.310 --> 05:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay what are you going to do about it
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
Mr uh air director you can to say we're
 
05:28:52.270 --> 05:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
going to do absolutely nothing because
 
05:28:53.948 --> 05:28:53.958 align:start position:0%
we have no authority to do anything is
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
that I just seems to set you up for the
 
05:28:59.470 --> 05:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
Fall Guy it it it is a little uh a
 
05:29:02.350 --> 05:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
little difficult but um I you know our
 
05:29:05.110 --> 05:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
our response in these situations is
 
05:29:11.070 --> 05:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
generally the RFA the rsa's that we uh
 
05:29:14.750 --> 05:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh enforce and and carry out um we do
 
05:29:16.628 --> 05:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
them with the authority that's provided
 
05:29:18.350 --> 05:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
to us by the legislature so if the
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
legislature chose to Pro to approve an
 
05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
RSA that had a a uh proabition on
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
something but no violation or whatever
 
05:29:33.430 --> 05:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
that would be our answer is um we we yes
 
05:29:35.910 --> 05:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
it is prohibited no we have no authority
 
05:29:39.708 --> 05:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
to address it
 
05:29:39.718 --> 05:29:43.830 align:start position:0%
to address it
further

05:29:43.830 --> 05:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
05:29:50.590 --> 05:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you next I'll call up did you
 
05:29:52.590 --> 05:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
have one uh representative I was just
 
05:29:54.190 --> 05:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could ask any questions
 
05:29:55.948 --> 05:29:55.958 align:start position:0%
of the meteorologist since he has
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
expertise in the in the cloud realm
 
05:30:00.868 --> 05:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
whereas Mr Fitzgerald is not an expert
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
that be permitted Mr Fitzgerald we uh
 
05:30:06.030 --> 05:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
Dave you want to join us he brought him
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
along you know m loves company uh uh so
 
05:30:13.590 --> 05:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
I don't is this to address this the
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
question about cloud seating and Heights
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
and so on yes I think that the
 
05:30:20.110 --> 05:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
atmospheric stuff that's not your
 
05:30:23.150 --> 05:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
specialty yeah I yeah I I would say and
 
05:30:26.030 --> 05:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to Dave after but I would say
 
05:30:26.040 --> 05:30:27.310 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to Dave after but I would say
that

05:30:27.310 --> 05:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:32.070 --> 05:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
obviously activities that occur uh at
 
05:30:35.470 --> 05:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
significant height 20 30,000 ft they
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
could occur in Ohio and those
 
05:30:41.470 --> 05:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
uh those emissions we we regularly deal
 
05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
with what's known as Air transport of of
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
pollutants from the Midwest um and so uh
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we have a monitoring station
 
05:30:50.910 --> 05:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
on top of Mount Washington and a
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
monitoring station at the top of Pacman
 
05:30:55.150 --> 05:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
adok to to measure those high level
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
emissions um but uh again Dave I don't
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
know if you have any familiarity with
 
05:31:05.110 --> 05:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding or anything to to add
 
05:31:07.910 --> 05:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah in well in the in the uh Rec
 
05:31:09.990 --> 05:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
research that I did to to prepare for
 
05:31:13.150 --> 05:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
for this hearing um and this is very
 
05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
limited research I should say but I I
 
05:31:19.470 --> 05:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
think I saw um altitudes of 12,000 to
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
13,000 ft for uh cloud seeding to be
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
effective but again that's just brief
 
05:31:27.390 --> 05:31:27.400 align:start position:0%
research that I did to to try to get
 
05:31:30.788 --> 05:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
ready for this meeting um but yeah Mike
 
05:31:33.390 --> 05:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
is correct to just to build on his point
 
05:31:35.910 --> 05:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
um you know Smoke Stacks from power
 
05:31:39.030 --> 05:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
plants in the Ohio River Valley that are
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know a th000 or 2,000 ft hot tall
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
they release pollutants that can be
 
05:31:46.788 --> 05:31:46.798 align:start position:0%
transported to our part of the country
 
05:31:52.310 --> 05:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:54.750 --> 05:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
currents followup I guess the question I
 
05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
would have is then who is responsible
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
for that level of the atmosphere if if
 
05:32:00.990 --> 05:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
we actually have people that are in
 
05:32:03.750 --> 05:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
charge of various pieces because it
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
seems like that it's the authority that
 
05:32:08.470 --> 05:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering about just you can't
 
05:32:09.990 --> 05:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit something like you say if a
 
05:32:13.150 --> 05:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
smoke stack in Ohio is creating what's
 
05:32:15.150 --> 05:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
happening in that band of the atmosphere
 
05:32:17.510 --> 05:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
whose jurisdiction is
 
05:32:21.190 --> 05:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
it well those types of sources um you
 
05:32:23.628 --> 05:32:23.638 align:start position:0%
know they're regulated by the Clean Air
 
05:32:28.510 --> 05:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
Act and then um the states also you know
 
05:32:30.190 --> 05:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
Under the Umbrella of the Clean Air Act
 
05:32:34.350 --> 05:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
enforce their own rules but
 
05:32:36.990 --> 05:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's you know it's a state
 
05:32:38.350 --> 05:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
federal partnership
 
05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
how we regulate those types of emission
 
05:32:45.830 --> 05:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
sources yeah I I would just add the uh
 
05:32:49.390 --> 05:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
we regularly meet with uh with EPA and
 
05:32:51.310 --> 05:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
with with other states we've had a
 
05:32:54.190 --> 05:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
number of efforts um uh as I mentioned
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
the ozone transport region um and
 
05:33:01.070 --> 05:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
various other um uh Clean Air Act
 
05:33:03.910 --> 05:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
requirements but um we certainly can't
 
05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
tell Ohio what to do but the EPA can can
 
05:33:09.628 --> 05:33:09.638 align:start position:0%
tell them and and the Clean Air Act does
 
05:33:12.150 --> 05:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
have Provisions that require states to
 
05:33:14.628 --> 05:33:14.638 align:start position:0%
address Interstate transport of
 
05:33:17.150 --> 05:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
pollutants uh and so we work very
 
05:33:19.548 --> 05:33:19.558 align:start position:0%
carefully with the EPA region and with
 
05:33:23.070 --> 05:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
the EPA on a national basis in in how to
 
05:33:25.030 --> 05:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
address emissions coming into our state
 
05:33:31.708 --> 05:33:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.948 --> 05:33:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:39.830 --> 05:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:41.910 --> 05:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
shell thank you Mr
 
05:33:44.230 --> 05:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
chair I guess my question
 
05:33:47.230 --> 05:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
is under what conditions do you need to
 
05:33:50.070 --> 05:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
have for cloud seating to work and in
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
the drought we frequently have the
 
05:33:53.270 --> 05:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
conditions that would allow cloud
 
05:33:58.510 --> 05:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:02.830 --> 05:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
work yeah again um cloud seating is is
 
05:34:04.830 --> 05:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
not just it's not in the air resources
 
05:34:10.628 --> 05:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:13.750 --> 05:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
um I I know and I know those activities
 
05:34:16.350 --> 05:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
go on um and there's nothing new about
 
05:34:19.868 --> 05:34:19.878 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding and um it does go on in
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
other parts of the world and I think uh
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
West you know States out
 
05:34:27.548 --> 05:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
west but um to my to my knowledge in the
 
05:34:29.910 --> 05:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
research I I've done it it's not
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
something that happens frequently in
 
05:34:34.030 --> 05:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
this part of the country so so I just
 
05:34:36.590 --> 05:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
don't really have a good answer for that
 
05:34:36.600 --> 05:34:38.470 align:start position:0%
don't really have a good answer for that
question

05:34:38.470 --> 05:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:34:40.270 --> 05:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
probably all our knowledge is uh based
 
05:34:44.190 --> 05:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
on cloud seating.com um
 
05:34:46.670 --> 05:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
so we really don't have a have a lot of
 
05:34:50.390 --> 05:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
expertise in that Arena followup please
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
followup I sort of tried to lead you
 
05:34:54.670 --> 05:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
into into the situation where Cloud
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
seatings only going to work when you
 
05:34:59.310 --> 05:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
have super saturated conditions in the
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
atmosphere if the air is not super
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
saturated you can seed all you want and
 
05:35:07.430 --> 05:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
there will be no rain so that's what I
 
05:35:09.750 --> 05:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
was looking for yeah do we have
 
05:35:12.510 --> 05:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
typically those conditions of saturation
 
05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:29.230 --> 05:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
probably we don't know we don't know
 
05:35:34.750 --> 05:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we just just just don't have
 
05:35:36.788 --> 05:35:36.798 align:start position:0%
the uh expertise on on cloud seating to
 
05:35:39.628 --> 05:35:39.638 align:start position:0%
be able to give you a good answer we'd
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
be happy to take a look at that and get
 
05:35:43.590 --> 05:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
back to you on something if we
 
05:35:47.670 --> 05:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
can so I have a question if you look at
 
05:35:51.390 --> 05:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
the last line of page one line 32 the
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
amendment or
 
05:35:59.310 --> 05:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
um yes the amendment okay last line page
 
05:36:03.628 --> 05:36:03.638 align:start position:0%
one yes it says that no person shall
 
05:36:07.868 --> 05:36:07.878 align:start position:0%
engage in activities involving the
 
05:36:10.150 --> 05:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
intentional release of polluting
 
05:36:14.230 --> 05:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
emissions would that prevent for example
 
05:36:14.240 --> 05:36:17.788 align:start position:0%
emissions would that prevent for example
crop

05:36:17.788 --> 05:36:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
dusting I believe there are uh specific
 
05:36:25.708 --> 05:36:25.718 align:start position:0%
crop um dusting I believe the Department
 
05:36:29.548 --> 05:36:29.558 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture has regulations um uh
 
05:36:33.150 --> 05:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
regarding that uh we don't we would not
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
regulate crop dusting uh unless there
 
05:36:38.110 --> 05:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
was a uh
 
05:36:41.548 --> 05:36:41.558 align:start position:0%
uh toxic emissions uh that met the
 
05:36:45.628 --> 05:36:45.638 align:start position:0%
requirements of um our statute uh the
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
toxics control act so um I know we have
 
05:36:51.390 --> 05:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
had we've been in touch we've had
 
05:36:55.350 --> 05:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
complaints about um pesticide spraying
 
05:36:58.990 --> 05:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
applications at in on apple trees and in
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
large Orchards and so on and those
 
05:37:03.628 --> 05:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
drifting into other areas and and we've
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
traditionally worked with the Department
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture on those to uh uh uh
 
05:37:11.390 --> 05:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
address them under their uh
 
05:37:14.510 --> 05:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
perview thank you yes further questions
 
05:37:16.708 --> 05:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas uh thank you Mr
 
05:37:19.708 --> 05:37:19.718 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to piggy back off off
 
05:37:21.670 --> 05:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
that last question for my clarification
 
05:37:24.910 --> 05:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
I know is not your fielded but and then
 
05:37:27.430 --> 05:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
am I to assume that if if crop dusting
 
05:37:29.948 --> 05:37:29.958 align:start position:0%
is taking place I assume whatever is
 
05:37:32.628 --> 05:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
used in the chemicals for crap dusting
 
05:37:35.830 --> 05:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
is allowed under the EPA Air Act I would
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
think uh and if if that's true then they
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
would not be considered pollutants and
 
05:37:45.470 --> 05:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
would not uh come under this bill if was
 
05:37:47.830 --> 05:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
passed I would certainly tend to agree
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
with that that if uh that if EPA had
 
05:37:52.548 --> 05:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
approved them as under the pesticide uh
 
05:37:59.150 --> 05:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
control uh act and um uh then uh it's
 
05:38:01.310 --> 05:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's you know probably an activity that
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
is would not be regulated by us under
 
05:38:07.708 --> 05:38:07.718 align:start position:0%
the Clean Air Act
 
05:38:09.350 --> 05:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire does have its own
 
05:38:11.788 --> 05:38:11.798 align:start position:0%
toxic Control Act
 
05:38:11.798 --> 05:38:13.470 align:start position:0%
toxic Control Act
that

05:38:13.470 --> 05:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:17.430 --> 05:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
um you know is is is a separate
 
05:38:19.708 --> 05:38:19.718 align:start position:0%
requirement so it's possible that
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
something could be approved by EPA but
 
05:38:25.310 --> 05:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's subject to our toxic Control Act um
 
05:38:27.910 --> 05:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
and again this is a gray area because
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
our our Act is generally um aimed at
 
05:38:36.030 --> 05:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
stationary sources um power plants and
 
05:38:38.190 --> 05:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
the chemical Manufacturing facilities
 
05:38:41.390 --> 05:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing um we don't have a
 
05:38:42.788 --> 05:38:42.798 align:start position:0%
lot of authority to the best of my
 
05:38:44.910 --> 05:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge to regulate emissions from
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
aircraft or you know uh pesticide
 
05:38:51.590 --> 05:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
spraying that sort of thing um we we'd
 
05:38:52.948 --> 05:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
have to work closely with the Department
 
05:38:56.350 --> 05:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture to ensure that there was
 
05:39:01.070 --> 05:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
um you know joint um control appropriate
 
05:39:01.080 --> 05:39:03.750 align:start position:0%
um you know joint um control appropriate
joint

05:39:03.750 --> 05:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:07.628 --> 05:39:07.638 align:start position:0%
control okay additional questions
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
sing none I'll thank you thank you very
 
05:39:14.310 --> 05:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
much and invite Steven KF to come talk
 
05:39:19.788 --> 05:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:32.350 --> 05:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:35.708 --> 05:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
KF press the red button
 
05:39:37.910 --> 05:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
please thank you good to see you all
 
05:39:40.190 --> 05:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
again I passed out my resume again so
 
05:39:42.990 --> 05:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
you know my credentials and the audience
 
05:39:44.670 --> 05:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
knows them
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
um U my credentials as a toxicologist
 
05:39:49.548 --> 05:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
I'm currently retired from a long career
 
05:39:51.548 --> 05:39:51.558 align:start position:0%
as a risk assessor evaluating impacts to
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
human and ecological Health my job was
 
05:39:55.788 --> 05:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
essentially to determine the relative
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
risks of industrial missions on human
 
05:39:59.990 --> 05:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
health and Wildlife and I have sampled
 
05:40:02.190 --> 05:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
and evaluated all types of environmental
 
05:40:04.190 --> 05:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
media and I worked in many states and
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
with many types of state and federal
 
05:40:08.390 --> 05:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Agencies
 
05:40:11.230 --> 05:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
I'm here to strongly support HP 764 I
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
was made aware of this issue when I
 
05:40:14.750 --> 05:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
retired in
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
2019 about four out of seven days every
 
05:40:19.990 --> 05:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
week I look up to see plumes of micro
 
05:40:22.628 --> 05:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
and nanop particulates streaking across
 
05:40:24.628 --> 05:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
the sky behind all different types of
 
05:40:26.110 --> 05:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
high altitude
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
aircraft these plumes start out looking
 
05:40:30.708 --> 05:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
quite sharp and defined like
 
05:40:32.830 --> 05:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
contrails but then they persist
 
05:40:34.750 --> 05:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
gradually diffusing out horizontally
 
05:40:37.310 --> 05:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
across the sky as they hygroscopically
 
05:40:39.310 --> 05:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
absorb more and more water vapor which
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
is what cloud seeding normally does by
 
05:40:45.150 --> 05:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
the end of the day just like clockwork
 
05:40:47.190 --> 05:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
the sun is blotted out by a thick Haze
 
05:40:49.350 --> 05:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
more often than not the end result will
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
be an entirely overcast sky or Worse It
 
05:40:54.590 --> 05:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
Will Rain the following day now some of
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
you may be skeptical about this but I
 
05:40:58.670 --> 05:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to not only look up
 
05:41:01.030 --> 05:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
but to look up throughout the day and
 
05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
watch the progression of these plumes
 
05:41:06.030 --> 05:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
how do we know these are not contrails
 
05:41:08.230 --> 05:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
first you will see many of these plumes
 
05:41:11.548 --> 05:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
stop and start kind of like Morse code
 
05:41:14.270 --> 05:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
you will not see this staggered pattern
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
if it was normal jet exhaust second I
 
05:41:19.070 --> 05:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
have videotaped aircraft at similar
 
05:41:21.708 --> 05:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
altitudes one with a normal contrail
 
05:41:23.830 --> 05:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
which disappears as fast as it is formed
 
05:41:25.468 --> 05:41:25.478 align:start position:0%
but another alongside it with a
 
05:41:27.708 --> 05:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
persistent geoengineered
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
plume which then evolves into a thick
 
05:41:33.070 --> 05:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
lateral Cloud third I can show you many
 
05:41:35.948 --> 05:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
photographs in which these plumes Will
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
Rain Down visible Trails of particulates
 
05:41:41.310 --> 05:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
a phenomenon which I call Feathering
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
fourth there are thousands of photos and
 
05:41:46.310 --> 05:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
videos all over the Internet which shows
 
05:41:48.548 --> 05:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
Skies as a virtual checkerboard of
 
05:41:51.150 --> 05:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
persistent aircraft plumes even if you
 
05:41:53.670 --> 05:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe this is a true phenomenon
 
05:41:56.270 --> 05:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
should normal air traffic result in 90%
 
05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
of our incident sunlight to be blocked
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
out for the majority of each day I'm 71
 
05:42:05.030 --> 05:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
years old and I can tell you with 100%
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
confidence that normal air traffic never
 
05:42:09.548 --> 05:42:09.558 align:start position:0%
ended up destroying a sunny day on so
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
many occasions some of you might
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
remember deep blue skies as well as
 
05:42:16.110 --> 05:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
bright cottony white cumulous clouds
 
05:42:18.788 --> 05:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
which are not seen anymore since I have
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
retired I have sunk over $5,000 into
 
05:42:25.110 --> 05:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
buying an advanced dark field microscope
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
I have spent $2,000 to become certified
 
05:42:30.430 --> 05:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
as a certified live blood analyst and
 
05:42:32.270 --> 05:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm about to purchase a very expensive
 
05:42:35.070 --> 05:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
ICP Mass spectrometer which can measure
 
05:42:37.948 --> 05:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
very minute concentrations of met and
 
05:42:41.150 --> 05:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
water now why would I do this because
 
05:42:43.030 --> 05:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
since retirement I have been beyond
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
shocked to find out that the toxic
 
05:42:47.270 --> 05:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
metals and chemicals we are seeing rain
 
05:42:49.390 --> 05:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
down from the sky which have never been
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
seen in precipitation throughout my long
 
05:42:54.830 --> 05:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
career aluminum barium stonum those type
 
05:42:58.150 --> 05:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
of metals are also showing up in our
 
05:43:00.510 --> 05:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
blood in fact it's even worse than that
 
05:43:03.310 --> 05:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
it is truly orwellian to say this but we
 
05:43:05.030 --> 05:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
are also starting to see what what are
 
05:43:07.070 --> 05:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
known as self assembling nanotchnology
 
05:43:09.430 --> 05:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
techology not only in human blood but
 
05:43:10.990 --> 05:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
this technology is also seen in the
 
05:43:14.350 --> 05:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
blood of wildlife squirrels rabbits deer
 
05:43:18.750 --> 05:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
dogs cats you name it our surface soil
 
05:43:21.070 --> 05:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
surface water soil and most Foods also
 
05:43:23.468 --> 05:43:23.478 align:start position:0%
contain these visible structures now
 
05:43:25.390 --> 05:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
being an expert in sampling and Analysis
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
I can tell you with certainty that the
 
05:43:29.510 --> 05:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
level of contamination in a human or an
 
05:43:32.150 --> 05:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
animal is always directly proportional
 
05:43:34.990 --> 05:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
to the proximity to that Source
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
consequently since almost all
 
05:43:38.350 --> 05:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
environment Al media are
 
05:43:40.510 --> 05:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
contaminated the only possible source
 
05:43:42.510 --> 05:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
for this contamination is from
 
05:43:44.590 --> 05:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
geoengineering activities which has been
 
05:43:48.030 --> 05:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
going on since the 1960s probably
 
05:43:50.548 --> 05:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
earlier than that in fact there are many
 
05:43:52.750 --> 05:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
scientific papers that show direct
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
correlations between the adulteration of
 
05:43:57.110 --> 05:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere and contamination in
 
05:43:58.270 --> 05:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
humans and
 
05:44:00.990 --> 05:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
Wildlife and that is my testimony for
 
05:44:03.430 --> 05:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
today I appreciate you listening and
 
05:44:05.390 --> 05:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
your time and I just encourage you all
 
05:44:08.628 --> 05:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
to look up more often more frequently
 
05:44:11.070 --> 05:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions questions
 
05:44:13.390 --> 05:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
Club representative
 
05:44:19.110 --> 05:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
kapan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:44:23.788 --> 05:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
Mr K for coming in um I am curious about
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
your data on what you call the
 
05:44:28.468 --> 05:44:28.478 align:start position:0%
self-replicating nanotechnology or self
 
05:44:31.310 --> 05:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
something nanotechnology where where
 
05:44:33.230 --> 05:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
where can we see that or where is that I
 
05:44:36.030 --> 05:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
would direct you to so I'm a member of
 
05:44:39.350 --> 05:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
Dr David David Nixon's micronauts Group
 
05:44:41.230 --> 05:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
which is an international microscopy
 
05:44:43.910 --> 05:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
group I would direct you to Dr David ni
 
05:44:48.430 --> 05:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
Nixon's website uh Dr Anna milal Shia is
 
05:44:51.270 --> 05:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
um on her substack is um doing
 
05:44:54.310 --> 05:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
tremendous work just mindboggling work
 
05:44:58.190 --> 05:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
showing uh these uh self assembling
 
05:44:58.200 --> 05:45:00.868 align:start position:0%
showing uh these uh self assembling
particles

05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
particles
 
05:45:03.468 --> 05:45:03.478 align:start position:0%
um uh there are a bunch of other
 
05:45:05.430 --> 05:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
substacks uh you could go to
 
05:45:08.788 --> 05:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
geoengineering watch. .org uh I'm not
 
05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
sure they they would have that but and
 
05:45:13.310 --> 05:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
you know if you wanted to talk offline
 
05:45:15.510 --> 05:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy
 
05:45:17.708 --> 05:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
to you could come down to my house I
 
05:45:19.830 --> 05:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
could sit you down for a blood sampling
 
05:45:22.990 --> 05:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
analysis and maybe even show show them
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
blood I'll give you the I'll give you
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
the blood sampling analysis for
 
05:45:34.788 --> 05:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
free thank
 
05:45:40.948 --> 05:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:43.628 --> 05:45:43.638 align:start position:0%
glub well I guess there's no more thank
 
05:45:46.150 --> 05:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
you sir for giving us your perspective
 
05:45:48.070 --> 05:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
next up is Melissa white of
 
05:45:51.468 --> 05:45:51.478 align:start position:0%
Peterboro just put money in the meter so
 
05:45:54.030 --> 05:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
if you can go to the next one oh okay
 
05:45:56.910 --> 05:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
next up is Rick Fazio of the business
 
05:46:03.990 --> 05:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
Association good afternoon everyone uh
 
05:46:09.430 --> 05:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
ch Vose Vice chair Thomas and committee
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
members for the record I'm Rick Fabrizio
 
05:46:14.390 --> 05:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh senior director of advocacy and
 
05:46:16.030 --> 05:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
public affairs for the business and
 
05:46:18.070 --> 05:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
industry Association New Hampshire
 
05:46:21.150 --> 05:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce just uh
 
05:46:23.150 --> 05:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
learned of the amendment earlier this
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
afternoon um we were opposed to the
 
05:46:28.030 --> 05:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
original version because of the
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
inclusion of electromagnetic radio
 
05:46:33.750 --> 05:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
frequency and micro microwave radiation
 
05:46:36.190 --> 05:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
with the removal of that we would go to
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
a neutral position but I thought it was
 
05:46:41.430 --> 05:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
important to state that as fact in case
 
05:46:43.948 --> 05:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
in any part of the process a move was
 
05:46:47.190 --> 05:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
made to restore references to the
 
05:46:49.310 --> 05:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic radio frequency and
 
05:46:52.150 --> 05:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
microwave radiation I'm happy to take or
 
05:46:53.548 --> 05:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions you might
 
05:46:53.558 --> 05:46:58.510 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions you might
have

05:46:58.510 --> 05:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:01.830 --> 05:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
so questions for Mr
 
05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
fio representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:47:08.030 --> 05:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr FAO for being here
 
05:47:10.868 --> 05:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
um I you submitted testimony which I
 
05:47:13.430 --> 05:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
glanced over briefly so I understand
 
05:47:17.070 --> 05:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
that your exceptions were based on um is
 
05:47:21.390 --> 05:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
it Cellular use of there might be some
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
overlap with existing technologies that
 
05:47:27.310 --> 05:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
the electromagnetic radio frequency is
 
05:47:30.030 --> 05:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
primarily used for wireless communic
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
telecommunications which actually
 
05:47:34.628 --> 05:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
includes in certain cases television
 
05:47:38.990 --> 05:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
radio wireless cell service um as well
 
05:47:43.830 --> 05:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:45.948 --> 05:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
Communications additional questions
 
05:47:48.548 --> 05:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
representative Matson thank you Mr
 
05:47:52.350 --> 05:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker um vice sh chair sorry um you
 
05:47:54.030 --> 05:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
said that you know a little bit about
 
05:47:55.708 --> 05:47:55.718 align:start position:0%
the cloud seeding can you tell me what
 
05:47:59.110 --> 05:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
altitude they usually I I I certainly
 
05:48:01.670 --> 05:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
did not oh sorry so I was just wondering
 
05:48:03.310 --> 05:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea what altitude they
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
usually do this Cloud SE in hearing the
 
05:48:08.110 --> 05:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
references someone said 12 to 13,000 ft
 
05:48:10.190 --> 05:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
while someone else had mentioned perhaps
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
as high as 30 35,000 ft and had made
 
05:48:15.948 --> 05:48:15.958 align:start position:0%
that point that at that height you start
 
05:48:19.150 --> 05:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
to you know if you did it here at 30,000
 
05:48:22.270 --> 05:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
ft it might be off the coast but no I
 
05:48:25.708 --> 05:48:25.718 align:start position:0%
just had really uh looked up that um
 
05:48:25.718 --> 05:48:26.708 align:start position:0%
just had really uh looked up that um
weather

05:48:26.708 --> 05:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
weather
 
05:48:30.510 --> 05:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
modification uh does not use radio
 
05:48:33.468 --> 05:48:33.478 align:start position:0%
frequencies and and certainly not D in
 
05:48:39.150 --> 05:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.160 --> 05:48:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
additional

05:48:42.110 --> 05:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:45.390 --> 05:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr faio
 
05:48:49.390 --> 05:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.270 --> 05:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
Peterboro hi there thank you for having
 
05:49:01.350 --> 05:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
us today uh my name is Melissa white I
 
05:49:03.990 --> 05:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
live in Peterboro um I appreciate the
 
05:49:07.230 --> 05:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss hb76 for with you
 
05:49:08.670 --> 05:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me for being out of breath I just
 
05:49:11.868 --> 05:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
had to feed my meter um and thank you
 
05:49:14.910 --> 05:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
representative Penza for this great bill
 
05:49:20.708 --> 05:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
um so couple things um I know that um
 
05:49:23.670 --> 05:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
you already read the statutory or the
 
05:49:27.430 --> 05:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
stat the the um legal EAS of the weather
 
05:49:27.440 --> 05:49:28.750 align:start position:0%
stat the the um legal EAS of the weather
modification

05:49:28.750 --> 05:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
modification
 
05:49:33.670 --> 05:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
experimentation um Bill U or law 12- F1
 
05:49:36.070 --> 05:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
um but it says any department or agency
 
05:49:37.590 --> 05:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
of the state May with the approval of
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council and within the
 
05:49:41.708 --> 05:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
limits of appropriated funds or by means
 
05:49:44.190 --> 05:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
of gifts donations or grants engage in
 
05:49:47.230 --> 05:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
and within the limits of appropriated
 
05:49:48.868 --> 05:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
wait sorry I read that part undertake
 
05:49:50.830 --> 05:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
experimentation in the techniques and
 
05:49:53.230 --> 05:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
methods for weather modification and may
 
05:49:55.350 --> 05:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
cooperate therein in the federal
 
05:49:57.830 --> 05:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
government with authorized agencies of
 
05:49:59.708 --> 05:49:59.718 align:start position:0%
other states and with interested persons
 
05:50:01.110 --> 05:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
and organ
 
05:50:03.270 --> 05:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
organizations so basically it's saying
 
05:50:05.990 --> 05:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
that any interested party can undertake
 
05:50:08.510 --> 05:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
an experiment ation in the techniques
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
and and methods for weather
 
05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
modifications so even if you think it's
 
05:50:14.430 --> 05:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
not happening now you can see again from
 
05:50:17.910 --> 05:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
the documents Federal documents that um
 
05:50:19.830 --> 05:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
you have been given by representative
 
05:50:21.468 --> 05:50:21.478 align:start position:0%
Penza or she will give you if you
 
05:50:23.230 --> 05:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
haven't received them already that it
 
05:50:25.670 --> 05:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
will happen in the future because state
 
05:50:29.868 --> 05:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
law allows it and because of that state
 
05:50:34.030 --> 05:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
law 12- F1 must be repealed in its
 
05:50:36.750 --> 05:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
entirety the last line of the law the
 
05:50:39.590 --> 05:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
full law says that the state will
 
05:50:42.110 --> 05:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
solicit public input regarding the
 
05:50:44.590 --> 05:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
proposed me weather modification program
 
05:50:46.590 --> 05:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
or experimentation
 
05:50:49.590 --> 05:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
but soliciting public input is not the
 
05:50:50.910 --> 05:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
same as
 
05:50:53.830 --> 05:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
consent I host a social Media Group with
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
almost 2,000 members here in New
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not everyone's from New
 
05:51:00.430 --> 05:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let's say 1500 are but not
 
05:51:02.270 --> 05:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
that many people could come today
 
05:51:05.230 --> 05:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
because we work and we received very
 
05:51:08.548 --> 05:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
short notice of this hearing so I just
 
05:51:11.788 --> 05:51:11.798 align:start position:0%
want you to know that none of us consent
 
05:51:14.788 --> 05:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
to being experimented on and that is the
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
goal of
 
05:51:20.510 --> 05:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
764 um and I also wanted to just point
 
05:51:24.990 --> 05:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
out that um a lot of the questions seem
 
05:51:27.708 --> 05:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
to be getting way off um way away from
 
05:51:32.670 --> 05:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
the topic or or of the actual bill um so
 
05:51:34.830 --> 05:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
the the goal of the bill is to
 
05:51:38.310 --> 05:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
repeal uh 12- F1 and that's that's
 
05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
pretty much it um and regarding the idea
 
05:51:46.590 --> 05:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
that you know crop dusting could be
 
05:51:48.110 --> 05:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
considered intentional release of
 
05:51:50.190 --> 05:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
polluting emissions it says specifically
 
05:51:53.150 --> 05:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
in those lines that it's in regards to
 
05:51:55.110 --> 05:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
geoengineering that solar radiation
 
05:51:57.430 --> 05:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
modification involving the intentional
 
05:51:59.548 --> 05:51:59.558 align:start position:0%
release of of polluting emissions so
 
05:52:01.230 --> 05:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
that is all connected to geoengineering
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's not about crop dusting or you know
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
other other activities so so
 
05:52:10.350 --> 05:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
um again I'm a little rushed so I hope I
 
05:52:13.548 --> 05:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
made sense and thank you all for your
 
05:52:15.750 --> 05:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
time well thank you appreciate you
 
05:52:18.270 --> 05:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
coming all the way from Peterboro
 
05:52:18.280 --> 05:52:19.350 align:start position:0%
coming all the way from Peterboro
questions

05:52:19.350 --> 05:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
for yes representative McGee Mr chairman
 
05:52:24.430 --> 05:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here and thank
 
05:52:27.390 --> 05:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
you for making the time um I just wanted
 
05:52:32.590 --> 05:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
to go back to 12f uh one because I see
 
05:52:36.830 --> 05:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
where it says um at the end of section
 
05:52:39.190 --> 05:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
one that there can be cooperation with
 
05:52:40.788 --> 05:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
the federal government authorized
 
05:52:42.270 --> 05:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
agencies or other states and with
 
05:52:44.590 --> 05:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
interested persons and organizations but
 
05:52:46.830 --> 05:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
that's not who's allowed to do this it's
 
05:52:48.230 --> 05:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
the the beginning of the sentence says
 
05:52:51.868 --> 05:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
any department or agency of the state
 
05:52:54.868 --> 05:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
may with the approval of the governor
 
05:52:57.548 --> 05:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
and councel so it isn't anybody that can
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
do this I mean the language is very
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
specific okay and so I just wanted to
 
05:53:02.868 --> 05:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
clarify that because I don't I don't
 
05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
think the intent of the people who put
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
this in place originally
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
um intended for it to be that anyone
 
05:53:13.788 --> 05:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
could do this without Authority from the
 
05:53:16.510 --> 05:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
state the governor the council so okay
 
05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
yeah excellent thank you um yeah that's
 
05:53:21.990 --> 05:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
there was no question so you don't have
 
05:53:26.548 --> 05:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
to respond okay any uh questions for
 
05:53:26.558 --> 05:53:27.788 align:start position:0%
to respond okay any uh questions for
Miss

05:53:27.788 --> 05:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
05:53:31.628 --> 05:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
White seeing none thank you very much
 
05:53:43.070 --> 05:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:46.150 --> 05:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and welcome to
 
05:53:49.270 --> 05:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
St thank you for your time today I kind
 
05:53:50.670 --> 05:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
of listening to everybody else didn't
 
05:53:53.310 --> 05:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
write my own thing picking up the
 
05:53:56.150 --> 05:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
slack we have a ring developing around
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
our equator because most of us believe
 
05:54:01.030 --> 05:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
the Earth is round and that's the
 
05:54:05.590 --> 05:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
centrifugal force moving these micro uh
 
05:54:07.468 --> 05:54:07.478 align:start position:0%
Nano particles
 
05:54:10.750 --> 05:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
to the center of our equator just with
 
05:54:13.350 --> 05:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
kinetic energy so even though we don't
 
05:54:15.548 --> 05:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
see it linger here it still hangs out
 
05:54:17.430 --> 05:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
there and it is blotting out the sun
 
05:54:19.990 --> 05:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
permanently with a ring like
 
05:54:22.430 --> 05:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
Saturn so this is we're going to be
 
05:54:24.750 --> 05:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
accountable to other countries and
 
05:54:27.150 --> 05:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
Nations and New Hampshire going along
 
05:54:29.390 --> 05:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
with it puts their Neco on that line
 
05:54:31.468 --> 05:54:31.478 align:start position:0%
saying well we agree with it cuz we're
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
letting it happen here too so we want to
 
05:54:35.708 --> 05:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
quickly remove ourselves from
 
05:54:37.948 --> 05:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
cooperating with any of this because
 
05:54:41.110 --> 05:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's genocide if you didn't know I know
 
05:54:42.910 --> 05:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
people keep saying things like burum
 
05:54:44.510 --> 05:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
salts but you got to understand that is
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
10,000 times more toxic than lead and
 
05:54:50.788 --> 05:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
you're breathing it all right now the
 
05:54:52.190 --> 05:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
stuff in this the nanop particles
 
05:54:55.150 --> 05:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
actually cross your brain barrier and
 
05:54:56.590 --> 05:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
other things that they're adding to
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
these mixtures not all of them there's
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
different sets of goop that they dump on
 
05:55:05.830 --> 05:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
us but they are putting uh MN a
 
05:55:08.788 --> 05:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
messenger your ribonucleic acid now if
 
05:55:10.030 --> 05:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know what that is that's a
 
05:55:13.070 --> 05:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
stranded DNA that they're using aids to
 
05:55:14.948 --> 05:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
connect to your body through gain a
 
05:55:17.548 --> 05:55:17.558 align:start position:0%
function so they can control and read
 
05:55:19.628 --> 05:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
your thoughts and
 
05:55:21.788 --> 05:55:21.798 align:start position:0%
bodies and they say we won't ever need
 
05:55:23.788 --> 05:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
an election because they'll know what
 
05:55:26.830 --> 05:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
our answer is already through Ai and
 
05:55:29.110 --> 05:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
that is the interface that they are
 
05:55:32.548 --> 05:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
dumping in the clouds so with that being
 
05:55:34.590 --> 05:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
said I don't think I have to elaborate
 
05:55:36.830 --> 05:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
on how legal or unlegal it is you're
 
05:55:38.670 --> 05:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
going along with
 
05:55:41.910 --> 05:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
genocide they're poisoning our crops the
 
05:55:44.030 --> 05:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
aluminum makes it so crops don't absorb
 
05:55:46.868 --> 05:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
water unless you they have a patent on a
 
05:55:49.468 --> 05:55:49.478 align:start position:0%
specific type of seed in California and
 
05:55:51.548 --> 05:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
if you buy their seed your stuff will
 
05:55:54.350 --> 05:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
grow me as a farmer I've already noticed
 
05:55:56.708 --> 05:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
the difference last year in the size of
 
05:55:59.628 --> 05:55:59.638 align:start position:0%
our crops their seed versus our heirloom
 
05:56:02.310 --> 05:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
which is always worked in gilmington
 
05:56:04.868 --> 05:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
it's different now already and I watch
 
05:56:07.868 --> 05:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
these planes leave from Portland and
 
05:56:11.788 --> 05:56:11.798 align:start position:0%
they drive straight down the Gil the the
 
05:56:14.590 --> 05:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
lowen ridge headed straight to Vermont
 
05:56:16.430 --> 05:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
you watch them dump it out in the same
 
05:56:18.910 --> 05:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
flight pattern every time and they are
 
05:56:21.230 --> 05:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
blasting it with radio waves CU you can
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
see the waves in the clouds as they
 
05:56:26.430 --> 05:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
light them up the way this works is it
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
heats up the Nano particles that like
 
05:56:30.910 --> 05:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
the aluminum that is in there and that
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
heat creates a thinner place in the
 
05:56:35.390 --> 05:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and that stalls weather or
 
05:56:37.350 --> 05:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
makes it go around they literally move
 
05:56:39.910 --> 05:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
rainstorms to or from places you say
 
05:56:42.990 --> 05:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
it's dry out it's cuz they made it dry
 
05:56:44.548 --> 05:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
it's not raining it's not cuz there's no
 
05:56:45.830 --> 05:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
water up there it's because they moved
 
05:56:48.990 --> 05:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
it around you and harp uses a barge that
 
05:56:52.590 --> 05:56:52.600 align:start position:0%
floats this gigantic trillion watt laser
 
05:56:54.628 --> 05:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
out around and they are off your coast
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
and they shoot it from anywhere on Earth
 
05:56:58.350 --> 05:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
they want to float these things it's not
 
05:57:00.390 --> 05:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
just the infrastructure that's in Alaska
 
05:57:02.110 --> 05:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just the one that's down in
 
05:57:03.990 --> 05:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico it's not just the one up in
 
05:57:05.830 --> 05:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
Norway it's not the one in Germany we
 
05:57:08.110 --> 05:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
have them floating around the world
 
05:57:10.548 --> 05:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
blasting our atmosphere I ran for
 
05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
governor last year and I came in third
 
05:57:14.990 --> 05:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the Republican primary and this is
 
05:57:17.548 --> 05:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
one of the legs of the stool I went on
 
05:57:21.070 --> 05:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
this getting rid of voting machines and
 
05:57:23.750 --> 05:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
stop poisoning us unv voluntarily with
 
05:57:27.110 --> 05:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
these mandated vaccines that are poison
 
05:57:29.788 --> 05:57:29.798 align:start position:0%
poison folks and this stuff in the air
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
is the same stuff that's in the vaccine
 
05:57:35.548 --> 05:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
in some of these Blends so you are not
 
05:57:38.270 --> 05:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
doing it willingly but by not making
 
05:57:41.390 --> 05:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
laws against it you're complicit so
 
05:57:42.910 --> 05:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time if anybody has a
 
05:57:45.670 --> 05:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
question I'd be happy to answer
 
05:57:52.190 --> 05:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:54.270 --> 05:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
anybody all right thank you very much
 
05:57:57.788 --> 05:57:57.798 align:start position:0%
for hearing my reality thank you next up
 
05:57:59.788 --> 05:57:59.798 align:start position:0%
is Bob
 
05:58:03.628 --> 05:58:03.638 align:start position:0%
mccl who um is from Grant grout Hill or
 
05:58:03.638 --> 05:58:10.150 align:start position:0%
mccl who um is from Grant grout Hill or
grill

05:58:10.150 --> 05:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:12.190 --> 05:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
how are you
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
doing we're good how are you goad thank
 
05:58:15.990 --> 05:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
you for having me
 
05:58:18.670 --> 05:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives I got a couple things to
 
05:58:20.390 --> 05:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
add as
 
05:58:25.350 --> 05:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
well um HB 1700 when Jason put that
 
05:58:28.230 --> 05:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
through last year I believe maybe you
 
05:58:31.070 --> 05:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
guys don't really know but it went viral
 
05:58:34.628 --> 05:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
across social media across the country
 
05:58:36.230 --> 05:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
people are making videos about it they
 
05:58:37.990 --> 05:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
were super excited for it to be going
 
05:58:39.070 --> 05:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
through and everybody was looking
 
05:58:42.510 --> 05:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
towards New Hampshire as you know you
 
05:58:45.788 --> 05:58:45.798 align:start position:0%
guys are doing that I like it you know
 
05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
and uh it felt good to see that in New
 
05:58:50.548 --> 05:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and all these people making
 
05:58:53.310 --> 05:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
the videos but jumping on top of that
 
05:58:54.670 --> 05:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a big deal when it
 
05:58:56.548 --> 05:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
comes down to all this because what
 
05:58:58.510 --> 05:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
Kelly was talking about earlier
 
05:59:00.430 --> 05:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
obviously we're going through a lot
 
05:59:04.510 --> 05:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
of uh executive orders and they're going
 
05:59:06.430 --> 05:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
ping ping ping and nobody knows what's
 
05:59:07.788 --> 05:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
going to happen and they're like the
 
05:59:09.708 --> 05:59:09.718 align:start position:0%
most wackiest things you know like uh
 
05:59:11.590 --> 05:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
getting rid of paper straws if who knew
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
that was going to be an executive order
 
05:59:15.830 --> 05:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
but it was and I'm going to tell you
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
right now we are in a Big Clock Earth is
 
05:59:22.628 --> 05:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
a part of it the sun is the center of it
 
05:59:26.310 --> 05:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
and there's planets flying all over and
 
05:59:27.868 --> 05:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
if you guys paid attention a little bit
 
05:59:29.310 --> 05:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
you notice that there was a bunch of
 
05:59:31.230 --> 05:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
planets that lined up over the
 
05:59:35.310 --> 05:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
last actually they're still lined up and
 
05:59:36.910 --> 05:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
these planets are all made out of
 
05:59:39.150 --> 05:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
different materials and they all Vibe at
 
05:59:43.510 --> 05:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
different Vibes Metals gases rocks we're
 
05:59:47.190 --> 05:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
in a big Cosmic clock and uh we we're
 
05:59:50.070 --> 05:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to be vibing with these big
 
05:59:54.110 --> 05:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
Celestial planets but how would you stop
 
05:59:56.110 --> 05:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
that maybe spray the skies with
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
different metals and hit them with
 
06:00:00.990 --> 06:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
frequencies like 5G might sound a little
 
06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
wacky but when you get down to it you
 
06:00:06.310 --> 06:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
realize that everything's vibrational
 
06:00:08.708 --> 06:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
uh on top of this I just want to say uh
 
06:00:10.830 --> 06:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sick of these hazy sunsets in the
 
06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
summertime I lay out in the sun by the
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
water quite a bit and uh I pay attention
 
06:00:19.468 --> 06:00:19.478 align:start position:0%
to the Sun and I pay attention to all
 
06:00:22.310 --> 06:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
the clouds and I'm sick of it I know
 
06:00:23.788 --> 06:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
everybody's sick of it and it's not like
 
06:00:26.830 --> 06:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
you guys can stop them from doing it and
 
06:00:28.670 --> 06:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
probably are like what is that even
 
06:00:31.830 --> 06:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
talking about but you know what really
 
06:00:34.590 --> 06:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
it's like a big Collective and like he
 
06:00:36.430 --> 06:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
Kelly was talking about the executive
 
06:00:38.070 --> 06:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
orders are going to start coming through
 
06:00:39.510 --> 06:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
who knows if there's going to be one for
 
06:00:42.670 --> 06:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
that but like I said I used I always lay
 
06:00:44.590 --> 06:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
out in the sun all the time and I
 
06:00:47.070 --> 06:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
noticed during the Trump presidency that
 
06:00:49.070 --> 06:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
there was less Chemtrails during that
 
06:00:52.270 --> 06:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
time than there is during the Biden
 
06:00:58.468 --> 06:00:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:00.948 --> 06:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
more nope that's
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
it oh wait one more we've been finding
 
06:01:08.390 --> 06:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
that in Alzheimer's patients there's
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
massive amounts of aluminum deposits in
 
06:01:12.590 --> 06:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
these brains and it's messing with the
 
06:01:14.990 --> 06:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
neurons and if they're spraying aluminum
 
06:01:16.708 --> 06:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
down and everybody's breathing it in
 
06:01:20.830 --> 06:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's like the best way to intake it
 
06:01:24.468 --> 06:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:27.190 --> 06:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
maybe any
 
06:01:27.200 --> 06:01:31.910 align:start position:0%
maybe any
questions

06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:34.350 --> 06:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
questions apparently not that's thank
 
06:01:48.150 --> 06:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:50.350 --> 06:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
okay next up we'll call on
 
06:01:54.670 --> 06:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:58.590 --> 06:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
wheeler welcome representative to
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
st&amp; thank you chairman Vos members and
 
06:02:04.708 --> 06:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
Friends of the Science Tech house at
 
06:02:06.830 --> 06:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
Science and Technology committe I don't
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
often come here cuz I don't have a PhD
 
06:02:12.750 --> 06:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
so I just uh try to leave this to you
 
06:02:16.430 --> 06:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
guys now people when they first hear
 
06:02:19.468 --> 06:02:19.478 align:start position:0%
about this they say oh my God what a
 
06:02:23.390 --> 06:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theory what a crazy crackpot
 
06:02:25.270 --> 06:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
ridiculous conversation I don't even
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
know why I'm here but then you actually
 
06:02:30.548 --> 06:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
take the time to do the research not on
 
06:02:33.350 --> 06:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
infowars.com but just on the government
 
06:02:35.310 --> 06:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
websites and what information is
 
06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
available to to the public right now and
 
06:02:39.030 --> 06:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's clear that our skies are being
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
poisoned and I'm here not as somebody
 
06:02:45.230 --> 06:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
who knows why or knows what's going on
 
06:02:48.670 --> 06:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
but somebody just to say we should
 
06:02:50.590 --> 06:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
address this the state should actually
 
06:02:52.990 --> 06:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
take the time to address this if it is
 
06:02:55.270 --> 06:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
going on I'm positive it's illegal
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
because nobody voted on it and I think
 
06:03:02.468 --> 06:03:02.478 align:start position:0%
that RSA 12K should be repealed I think
 
06:03:02.478 --> 06:03:03.548 align:start position:0%
that RSA 12K should be repealed I think
that

06:03:03.548 --> 06:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:03:06.990 --> 06:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
12f thank you so many numbers 12f should
 
06:03:07.000 --> 06:03:07.708 align:start position:0%
12f thank you so many numbers 12f should
be

06:03:07.708 --> 06:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
repealed and I think that we should
 
06:03:11.230 --> 06:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
clean up our skies so that they can be
 
06:03:13.670 --> 06:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
blue skies again um you know there's a
 
06:03:16.030 --> 06:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
lot of pollution going on in this world
 
06:03:17.788 --> 06:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
and I think that if we were to move
 
06:03:19.788 --> 06:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
forward with cloud seeding or any of the
 
06:03:19.798 --> 06:03:21.750 align:start position:0%
forward with cloud seeding or any of the
other

06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:03:24.750 --> 06:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
um programs or projects that people who
 
06:03:26.430 --> 06:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
have a lot of wealth and a lot of money
 
06:03:28.510 --> 06:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
would like to move forward on then we
 
06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
leave ourselves in a dangerous position
 
06:03:32.990 --> 06:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
so I would urge the members of the
 
06:03:35.788 --> 06:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
science technology committee to look in
 
06:03:37.468 --> 06:03:37.478 align:start position:0%
to this and to continue to do what they
 
06:03:40.708 --> 06:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
can to potentially repeal 12f and to
 
06:03:42.868 --> 06:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
address some of these other uh concerns
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
in here and I would also say to look
 
06:03:48.670 --> 06:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
into the concerns around radiation uh
 
06:03:52.628 --> 06:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
from the Wi-Fi bands and 5G Technologies
 
06:03:54.110 --> 06:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
everyone says oh that's a crackpots
 
06:03:56.190 --> 06:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theory but again you look
 
06:03:59.070 --> 06:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
into it the Wi-Fi radiation bands they
 
06:04:01.510 --> 06:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
do have an effect on people and the more
 
06:04:03.310 --> 06:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
that we're allowing these Wi-Fi bands to
 
06:04:05.948 --> 06:04:05.958 align:start position:0%
go unregulated unaffected by the
 
06:04:07.510 --> 06:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
government the more we're putting our
 
06:04:11.868 --> 06:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
people at harm uh I'm here because I I
 
06:04:15.990 --> 06:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
have a military family I grew up under
 
06:04:16.000 --> 06:04:17.670 align:start position:0%
have a military family I grew up under
the

06:04:17.670 --> 06:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:04:20.708 --> 06:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
strong character of somebody who I won't
 
06:04:22.110 --> 06:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
say his name because he'd be upset if I
 
06:04:24.868 --> 06:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
did in a public space but he was special
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
ops and he is
 
06:04:29.948 --> 06:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
um uh that's all I'll say that's all I
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
can say I suppose but let me just say
 
06:04:34.990 --> 06:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
let me just say this is something that
 
06:04:37.190 --> 06:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
should be looked into into much more and
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
you don't need a 21-year-old or crazy
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorists to tell you that
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
you can look into a number of the other
 
06:04:49.110 --> 06:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
public well documented official records
 
06:04:51.670 --> 06:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
that exist of of this going on this has
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
been something that has been posited
 
06:04:55.310 --> 06:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
since the early
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
1930s uh and it's a practice that has
 
06:05:00.670 --> 06:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
been employed since that time so I thank
 
06:05:03.230 --> 06:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
the committee for the time I have to get
 
06:05:05.430 --> 06:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
back to committee as Kelly knows you
 
06:05:05.440 --> 06:05:06.190 align:start position:0%
back to committee as Kelly knows you
know

06:05:06.190 --> 06:05:06.200 align:start position:0%

but I'm going to apologize ahead of time
 
06:05:35.788 --> 06:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
for not being able to totally
 
06:05:41.350 --> 06:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
decipher the the name I think it's Ro
 
06:05:46.030 --> 06:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
iar does that sound like somebody who's
 
06:05:50.910 --> 06:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
here Rea starts with r starts with an r
 
06:05:54.030 --> 06:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
first name is our last name is e or
 
06:05:56.230 --> 06:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
maybe F and you filled out a pink card
 
06:05:59.310 --> 06:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
so that should narrow it down is it Rosa
 
06:06:03.990 --> 06:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:13.788 --> 06:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:17.510 --> 06:06:17.520 align:start position:0%

can press the button please thank you
 
06:06:32.628 --> 06:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
Risa R IA Evans EV ANS OHA Evans okay so
 
06:06:35.070 --> 06:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you to the committee for um
 
06:06:37.350 --> 06:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
considering ing this issue which I do
 
06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
think is one of the most important
 
06:06:41.788 --> 06:06:41.798 align:start position:0%
issues of our time and to representative
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
Penza for coming back with a wonderful
 
06:06:46.110 --> 06:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
bill this year um I wasn't planning to
 
06:06:49.750 --> 06:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
testify but the discussion about RSA 12f
 
06:06:51.150 --> 06:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
just made me want to say a couple of
 
06:06:54.750 --> 06:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
things about that so 12 F1 so I think
 
06:06:55.830 --> 06:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's really
 
06:06:58.948 --> 06:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
important in this statute um that allows
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
weather modification is that there is
 
06:07:04.070 --> 06:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely no requirement of any risk
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis there's no requirement
 
06:07:10.270 --> 06:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
that there be any benefits at all indeed
 
06:07:11.708 --> 06:07:11.718 align:start position:0%
let alone a requirement that the
 
06:07:14.468 --> 06:07:14.478 align:start position:0%
benefits outweigh the risks and so you
 
06:07:17.390 --> 06:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
know RSA 12 F1 really leaves us as
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
sitting ducks in New Hampshire so that's
 
06:07:21.948 --> 06:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
just I think the absence of any cost
 
06:07:23.990 --> 06:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
benefit requirement of a cost benefit
 
06:07:26.270 --> 06:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
analysis or benefit is just reason alone
 
06:07:29.708 --> 06:07:29.718 align:start position:0%
to to you know repeal that Statute in
 
06:07:33.548 --> 06:07:33.558 align:start position:0%
the section of the um amended um HB 764
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
that does allowed um CL seating in the
 
06:07:39.110 --> 06:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
cases of an emergency a drought there's
 
06:07:42.270 --> 06:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
a requirement that the that the state
 
06:07:44.750 --> 06:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
make a finding you know that there will
 
06:07:47.350 --> 06:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
not be harm to they have to assess the
 
06:07:49.310 --> 06:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
potential risks and benefits and ensure
 
06:07:51.150 --> 06:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
that the activities will not result in
 
06:07:53.150 --> 06:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
harm to the environment so there's a
 
06:07:55.030 --> 06:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
clear Improvement in terms of the
 
06:07:57.390 --> 06:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
activities that are allowed in the you
 
06:08:00.590 --> 06:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
know in the in the proposed bill so so I
 
06:08:01.708 --> 06:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
just wanted to talk because I think
 
06:08:03.350 --> 06:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion before about
 
06:08:04.310 --> 06:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know what are what are the
 
06:08:06.030 --> 06:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
differences and I think you know the
 
06:08:08.110 --> 06:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
other difference of course is that the
 
06:08:10.468 --> 06:08:10.478 align:start position:0%
the existing statute allows us to be
 
06:08:12.670 --> 06:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
experimented on without without any
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
consent and the activities that are
 
06:08:17.990 --> 06:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
allowed in the in the proposed Bill are
 
06:08:20.110 --> 06:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
just in case of emergency when you know
 
06:08:21.270 --> 06:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
when there's a finding that those
 
06:08:22.910 --> 06:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
activities will benefit the people of
 
06:08:24.350 --> 06:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also not harm the
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
environment so um so then stepping aside
 
06:08:30.150 --> 06:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
from the statutes I just want to follow
 
06:08:31.990 --> 06:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
up on what um several people have
 
06:08:33.868 --> 06:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
testified to about the importance of
 
06:08:36.510 --> 06:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
looking up at our skies really with an
 
06:08:38.990 --> 06:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
open mind with curiosity and with
 
06:08:41.270 --> 06:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
honesty um I have been watching the
 
06:08:44.430 --> 06:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
skies with dismay for over 10 years
 
06:08:46.510 --> 06:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
really not wanting to believe what I
 
06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
have seen I can remember and some of you
 
06:08:50.430 --> 06:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
on this committee are old enough to
 
06:08:52.910 --> 06:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
remember this too lying on my back on
 
06:08:55.190 --> 06:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
the beach looking up into a deep blue
 
06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
sky and seeing those billowy cumulus
 
06:09:00.468 --> 06:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
clouds that are so beautifully defined
 
06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
you know they're just like like these
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
these these things you just you on
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
unbelievably beautiful and specific and
 
06:09:10.830 --> 06:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
clear so you look up at the sky now and
 
06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
try to try to remember the last time
 
06:09:15.590 --> 06:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
that there was a crystal clear blue day
 
06:09:18.350 --> 06:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
with a few really well-defined clouds
 
06:09:20.910 --> 06:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
that behaved the way clouds behave the
 
06:09:23.468 --> 06:09:23.478 align:start position:0%
way they're supposed to behave you just
 
06:09:25.510 --> 06:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
you have to look up and another another
 
06:09:27.468 --> 06:09:27.478 align:start position:0%
sign that you're seeing a geoengineered
 
06:09:30.070 --> 06:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
sky is that the clouds don't behave the
 
06:09:32.510 --> 06:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
way that real clouds behave real clouds
 
06:09:35.430 --> 06:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
are orderly they float on air currents
 
06:09:36.948 --> 06:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
they they they just have an order in
 
06:09:38.510 --> 06:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
them which is why so many artists have
 
06:09:39.910 --> 06:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
painted them but if you look at the
 
06:09:42.468 --> 06:09:42.478 align:start position:0%
skies now they're what I call chimeras
 
06:09:44.670 --> 06:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
they're just clouds going in every
 
06:09:46.390 --> 06:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
direction because they weren't put there
 
06:09:49.030 --> 06:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
by Nature they're not natural so it
 
06:09:51.948 --> 06:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
really is happening as hard as it is to
 
06:09:54.590 --> 06:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
accept um so you have an opportunity to
 
06:09:56.390 --> 06:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
do something about this and I really
 
06:09:58.270 --> 06:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
urge you to take it up because this is
 
06:10:00.830 --> 06:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
really a you know a a a historic
 
06:10:02.830 --> 06:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank
 
06:10:09.110 --> 06:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:13.070 --> 06:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
Raa seeing none thank you last word on
 
06:10:16.270 --> 06:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation goes to Jason
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
Gard who I believe was the author of the
 
06:10:21.350 --> 06:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard last year so welcome
 
06:10:25.110 --> 06:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
back uh The Honorable Jason geard uh
 
06:10:27.750 --> 06:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you but I I wish there was a poliy
 
06:10:29.510 --> 06:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
you could choose if you have the
 
06:10:31.230 --> 06:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
honorable title or not I just find that
 
06:10:33.868 --> 06:10:33.878 align:start position:0%
kind of weird nobility kind of thing but
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that not no offense to um
 
06:10:38.270 --> 06:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
Jason Gart out of norfield and I just
 
06:10:39.590 --> 06:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to come in today I left work
 
06:10:41.670 --> 06:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's so I'm kind of dressed as I am
 
06:10:43.628 --> 06:10:43.638 align:start position:0%
but I work outside so I build houses up
 
06:10:45.628 --> 06:10:45.638 align:start position:0%
on Squam Lake and winaki and it's very
 
06:10:46.830 --> 06:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
beautiful up there I think it's nice
 
06:10:48.190 --> 06:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
being up in the
 
06:10:51.150 --> 06:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
mountains and I'm outside all day long I
 
06:10:52.468 --> 06:10:52.478 align:start position:0%
mean that's what I'm I'm on a roof or
 
06:10:55.110 --> 06:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
doing whatever so I have I don't want to
 
06:10:58.070 --> 06:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
tr say that my personal experience is
 
06:11:00.670 --> 06:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
greater than your expertise everybody in
 
06:11:02.670 --> 06:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
the room is definitely smarter than I am
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
but at the same time when you see
 
06:11:08.310 --> 06:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
these CL these condensation Trails
 
06:11:09.868 --> 06:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
coming out of these airplanes that
 
06:11:12.990 --> 06:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
behave differently as the much better
 
06:11:14.788 --> 06:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
verse speaker before me
 
06:11:19.230 --> 06:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned you you're required to believe
 
06:11:22.190 --> 06:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
essentially the government bureaucrats
 
06:11:24.830 --> 06:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
and as we found out through recent uh
 
06:11:27.270 --> 06:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
recent releases through the whole Doge
 
06:11:31.990 --> 06:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
thing paid you know media sources on the
 
06:11:33.390 --> 06:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
narrative that we're currently
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing and I just find that highly
 
06:11:37.510 --> 06:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
problematic in the fact that we have
 
06:11:39.030 --> 06:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
these commit these committees set up
 
06:11:41.230 --> 06:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
through the state house and as a state
 
06:11:43.430 --> 06:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative you are the oversight for
 
06:11:44.750 --> 06:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of the government but also
 
06:11:46.750 --> 06:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
you're a check on the federal government
 
06:11:49.390 --> 06:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
we're not just supposed to be we Sorry
 
06:11:51.910 --> 06:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
formerly but it's not just a rubber
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
stamp kind of a gig this is actually a
 
06:11:56.070 --> 06:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
pretty serious Endeavor and I just think
 
06:11:57.230 --> 06:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
when you have this many people who are
 
06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
willing to take off their time from work
 
06:12:01.110 --> 06:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
living so forth and I understand you
 
06:12:02.310 --> 06:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
guys are here but that's a different
 
06:12:04.830 --> 06:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
story you get $100 but we need to really
 
06:12:07.230 --> 06:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
take seriously and and wonder what's
 
06:12:10.830 --> 06:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
going on and is it worth my time to and
 
06:12:13.310 --> 06:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
as I can say at least for myself and
 
06:12:15.230 --> 06:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
many people here if any one of you on
 
06:12:16.750 --> 06:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
the committee said I want some evidence
 
06:12:18.190 --> 06:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
on this this and this or I want you to
 
06:12:20.270 --> 06:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
show me people would bend over backwards
 
06:12:21.628 --> 06:12:21.638 align:start position:0%
we got a guy will to give out blood
 
06:12:23.788 --> 06:12:23.798 align:start position:0%
samples which sound a little crazy but I
 
06:12:26.708 --> 06:12:26.718 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's it's really it's really
 
06:12:28.510 --> 06:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
indicative of the way that New Hampshire
 
06:12:30.910 --> 06:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
is where people care about each other
 
06:12:32.468 --> 06:12:32.478 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what this comes down
 
06:12:34.670 --> 06:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
to we had the government tell just
 
06:12:36.430 --> 06:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
sidetrack I'm coming back we had the
 
06:12:37.830 --> 06:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
government tell us that fluide was the
 
06:12:40.350 --> 06:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
best thing ever now we know it's
 
06:12:42.708 --> 06:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
basically retarding children's
 
06:12:44.270 --> 06:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities I mean that's
 
06:12:47.548 --> 06:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
a serious thing and it took a long time
 
06:12:49.070 --> 06:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I know multiple bills came through
 
06:12:50.468 --> 06:12:50.478 align:start position:0%
and got shot down in that period of time
 
06:12:51.910 --> 06:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
not blaming you guys but just saying
 
06:12:54.350 --> 06:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
that I I just worry where we're on this
 
06:12:56.468 --> 06:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
hole well we'll wait till we know for
 
06:12:58.868 --> 06:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
sure that this is going on I mean we
 
06:13:02.430 --> 06:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
have operation large area coverage in
 
06:13:05.190 --> 06:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
1957-58 by the US Army chemical Corps
 
06:13:07.430 --> 06:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
they involved spraying large areas from
 
06:13:10.270 --> 06:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
Wikipedia zinc cadum sulfide over cities
 
06:13:11.788 --> 06:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
including St Louis got hit really bad
 
06:13:14.030 --> 06:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's some it came out in the news
 
06:13:15.548 --> 06:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
around decade ago they were looking into
 
06:13:16.628 --> 06:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
it again and they're saying if it's
 
06:13:19.468 --> 06:13:19.478 align:start position:0%
radioactive as well but the point being
 
06:13:21.270 --> 06:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
is we have a government that will
 
06:13:23.670 --> 06:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
experiment on us it's it's basically a
 
06:13:27.390 --> 06:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
fact at this point so I believe that you
 
06:13:28.590 --> 06:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
as another element of government but
 
06:13:32.070 --> 06:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
closer to me should investigate this
 
06:13:34.190 --> 06:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
seriously reach out to people who were
 
06:13:35.910 --> 06:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
much smarter than I am and maybe even
 
06:13:37.548 --> 06:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
smarter than the people in his room and
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
find out what's going on because we
 
06:13:42.110 --> 06:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
really we're suffering here we're
 
06:13:43.750 --> 06:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
suffering here and I think people are
 
06:13:45.670 --> 06:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
actually literally dying from storms
 
06:13:47.270 --> 06:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
that are being manipulated we can talk
 
06:13:50.750 --> 06:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
about project Cirrus back in the 50s
 
06:13:52.628 --> 06:13:52.638 align:start position:0%
where they seated a hurricane off the
 
06:13:54.030 --> 06:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
coast of North Carolina well it was in
 
06:13:55.990 --> 06:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
North Carolina anyway made a hook back
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
into Mainland caused a bunch of damage
 
06:14:01.230 --> 06:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
and death Army denied it for a long time
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
finally admitted it and yeah we're just
 
06:14:06.310 --> 06:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
we getting into a weird place I just
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
wanted two quotes I'll read and then
 
06:14:10.150 --> 06:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
I'll leave you guys alone this is from
 
06:14:11.750 --> 06:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
President John F Kennedy addressing the
 
06:14:14.548 --> 06:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
United Nations in 1961 we shall propose
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
further Cooperative efforts between all
 
06:14:18.030 --> 06:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
nations in weather prediction and
 
06:14:21.190 --> 06:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
eventually in weather control
 
06:14:23.110 --> 06:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
1961 they just haven't been sitting
 
06:14:24.708 --> 06:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
around we as you see we waste billions
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
of dollars on crazy things so second
 
06:14:28.708 --> 06:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
quote is it lays the predicate and
 
06:14:30.230 --> 06:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
foundation for the development of a
 
06:14:31.990 --> 06:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
weather satellite that will permit man
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
to determine the world's Cloud layer and
 
06:14:36.350 --> 06:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately to control the weather and he
 
06:14:38.070 --> 06:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
who controls the weather will control
 
06:14:40.430 --> 06:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
the world that was Lyndon Baines Johnson
 
06:14:42.628 --> 06:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
at Southwest Texas State Texas State
 
06:14:44.788 --> 06:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
University in 1962 and if you guys get a
 
06:14:46.948 --> 06:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
chance that video clip is really crazy
 
06:14:49.110 --> 06:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
the way he has this really kind of Dr
 
06:14:52.030 --> 06:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
Evil thing going on it's really creepy
 
06:14:53.468 --> 06:14:53.478 align:start position:0%
so anyway um I want to thank you for
 
06:14:55.628 --> 06:14:55.638 align:start position:0%
your time and I really would encourage
 
06:14:57.030 --> 06:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
anybody if you if you want to reach out
 
06:14:58.510 --> 06:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
to anybody here I know most of people
 
06:15:01.110 --> 06:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
here you can contact me or them directly
 
06:15:02.628 --> 06:15:02.638 align:start position:0%
and let's just look into this seriously
 
06:15:04.468 --> 06:15:04.478 align:start position:0%
Tennessee made a step in the right
 
06:15:06.750 --> 06:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
direction I disagree with Kelly on this
 
06:15:07.868 --> 06:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
I think there should be a penalty
 
06:15:10.150 --> 06:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
provision even if it's $1 and I kind of
 
06:15:11.868 --> 06:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
get the concept if you put a penalty
 
06:15:13.948 --> 06:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
provision in and you establish liability
 
06:15:15.670 --> 06:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
the lawsuits the lawsuits will start
 
06:15:18.430 --> 06:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
flooding in but that's the point courts
 
06:15:19.830 --> 06:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
are how we're supposed to handle our
 
06:15:21.628 --> 06:15:21.638 align:start position:0%
problems not through mobs in the street
 
06:15:23.868 --> 06:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
and so forth we should litigate these
 
06:15:25.468 --> 06:15:25.478 align:start position:0%
things take experts from both sides and
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
figure out what's going on and I think
 
06:15:28.070 --> 06:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's what this really comes down to in
 
06:15:29.788 --> 06:15:29.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways is nobody wants to be
 
06:15:35.190 --> 06:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
caught liable for the harm so thank you
 
06:15:37.110 --> 06:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
well thank you and I apologize for
 
06:15:40.150 --> 06:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
calling you honorable but I appreciate
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
that I didn't intend to insult you by
 
06:15:46.310 --> 06:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
doing that so no questions I guess for
 
06:15:49.150 --> 06:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
Mr Gard well that being the last pink
 
06:15:52.670 --> 06:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
card that I have I think this uh public
 
06:15:55.990 --> 06:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
hearing is now complete so I will can I
 
06:15:58.310 --> 06:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
say one thing real quick yes
 
06:16:00.510 --> 06:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza will allow you to
 
06:16:02.548 --> 06:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
come back and just real quick be real
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
quick thank you okay so I just wanted to
 
06:16:08.150 --> 06:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
to follow up on the speaker that came in
 
06:16:12.510 --> 06:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
um uh from The Business Association so
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
when so in the original bill of 764
 
06:16:21.468 --> 06:16:21.478 align:start position:0%
before I pulled out um they used um they
 
06:16:25.948 --> 06:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
used the HB 1700 from last session they
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
used that in the description so even in
 
06:16:32.150 --> 06:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
the original bill of 764 it didn't have
 
06:16:35.468 --> 06:16:35.478 align:start position:0%
anything about um microwave radiation or
 
06:16:39.750 --> 06:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
any of that so um so and she realized
 
06:16:42.270 --> 06:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
that she screwed up but she said okay
 
06:16:43.788 --> 06:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
well you're you're most likely going to
 
06:16:46.430 --> 06:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
do an amendment so I never changed the
 
06:16:48.670 --> 06:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
description um and of course everything
 
06:16:50.468 --> 06:16:50.478 align:start position:0%
came as we all know when we were Bill
 
06:16:54.270 --> 06:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
filing so um in the previous version it
 
06:16:56.548 --> 06:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
never it never talks about you know
 
06:16:58.390 --> 06:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic radio frency or
 
06:17:00.708 --> 06:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
microwave radiation in in the original
 
06:17:03.030 --> 06:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill either so that was a mistake from
 
06:17:05.190 --> 06:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
OS they just pulled the exact same
 
06:17:07.948 --> 06:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
description from U from HP 1700 I just
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
wanted the committee to know that and
 
06:17:12.230 --> 06:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
I'm glad the speaker said we're all good
 
06:17:14.990 --> 06:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
with the bill or you know no position so
 
06:17:17.230 --> 06:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
that's really good um I just wanted to
 
06:17:19.750 --> 06:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
make that a note so so you're saying
 
06:17:22.628 --> 06:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
that the title of the bill the title of
 
06:17:24.910 --> 06:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
the bill in the amendment is now fixed
 
06:17:27.628 --> 06:17:27.638 align:start position:0%
but before when it came out it that was
 
06:17:31.590 --> 06:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
from that's the exact same um yeah she
 
06:17:34.070 --> 06:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
didn't grab my title she put everything
 
06:17:36.070 --> 06:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
else in but she told she pulled the
 
06:17:39.310 --> 06:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
title from the bill from HP 1700 so
 
06:17:41.030 --> 06:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's why of course that other speaker
 
06:17:43.150 --> 06:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
when they were going to oppose it was
 
06:17:44.948 --> 06:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
con you know was concerned because it
 
06:17:47.110 --> 06:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
was just in the title but it wasn't
 
06:17:48.628 --> 06:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
there wasn't anything in the bill that
 
06:17:51.670 --> 06:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
talked about it anyway so so the
 
06:17:54.150 --> 06:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
scheduling notice that we had for
 
06:17:57.390 --> 06:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
today's public hearings had two titles
 
06:18:00.270 --> 06:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
that were incorrect due to something
 
06:18:05.270 --> 06:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
that OS did correct well okay good
 
06:18:05.280 --> 06:18:06.350 align:start position:0%
that OS did correct well okay good
thank

06:18:06.350 --> 06:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:18:09.670 --> 06:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
you all right with that we'll close the
 
06:18:12.510 --> 06:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
06:18:17.150 --> 06:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
764 FN and that will conclude unless
 
06:18:20.230 --> 06:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
there are uh activities the committee
 
06:18:23.190 --> 06:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
would like to conduct representative
 
06:18:25.628 --> 06:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
PL uh thank you chair there was a
