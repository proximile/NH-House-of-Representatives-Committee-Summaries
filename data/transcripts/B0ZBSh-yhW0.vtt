beneficiaries of Public Works
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
employees this bill was inspired by a
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
family who lost a father a husband and
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
they hoped that no other family would
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
encounter the financial difficulty that
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
they encountered after their loss of
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
their family
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
member um this also is uh a bill that
 
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640 align:start position:0%
adds the importance of of um how
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous of a job Public Works jobs C
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
lives on the line for our
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
safety and this bill would uh be
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
parallel to the ones we passed recently
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
for other
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
professions um and it was um passed in a
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan manner in both
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%

committee uh year ago passed 15 to4 and
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
then the house on a Voice vote in the
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
Senate uh when it was voted upon on its
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
committee I have a question Madam chair
 
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.310 align:start position:0%
committee I have a question Madam chair
yes

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
representa thank you just a moment while
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
I turn on
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
my video so that I'm Not Invisible to
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
the other members and attenders
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to know that
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
um um that uh the testimony in addition
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
to what represent Schulz has just
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
indicated uh spoke about the fact that
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh these people
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
um she already mentioned they first they
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
are First Responders and that they are
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
subject to uh considerable danger um out
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
on the roadway in many cases are
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
operating heavy equipment
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
question so I'm I'm wondering um
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
what the opposition first question what
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
was the opposition if any to this bill
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
when it was heard in our committee last
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
time I don't remember I do know that the
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
majority of folks voted for it and I the
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
four who voted against I don't know I
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
don't believe there was a Minority
 
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.389 align:start position:0%
don't believe there was a Minority
Report

00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
followup follow there are four other
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
people wishing to testify representative
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
Schmidt perhaps they will answer your
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
question questions may I ask it's a
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
simple question uh what kind of numbers
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
are we talking about that would be
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
entitled to this benefit uh if it were
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
provided uh that's a very good question
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh I would hope
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
zero uh unfortunately this profession in
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
approximately one person dies um every
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
year or
 
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair um
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
can everyone hear me all
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
right okay um I will just add that uh I
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
I served on the subcommittee that worked
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
on this bill last term and we had
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
several meetings to address various
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
questions um particularly pertaining to
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
some of the language in the bill uh we
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
met several times and ended up crafting
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
a bill that as representative Schultz
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
said passed this committee then
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately passed both bodies House and
 
00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959 align:start position:0%
Senate unfortunately it got rolled into
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
one of the Omnibus bills and its fate
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
became clouded due to that but um I
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
personally felt that it it really um we
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
worked on it enough to get it crafted to
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
the point where it was going to do the
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
job uh I will state in answer sort of to
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid's question that we
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
did hear that there were perhaps one or
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
two employees a year um excuse me one
 
00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
employee every year or two who would
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
fall in into this category and I would
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
point out further that the language in
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
the bill states that it's going to be up
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner of the Department of
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
Safety to
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
investigate each one of these deaths to
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
be sure that the
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
circum fit the
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
qualifications that are required by the
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
bill so it's not just going to be oh
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
this guy died by the side of the road he
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
gets the benefit it will be investigated
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
and part of that is due to the fact that
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
we heard from the family members uh who
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
testified previously that that was one
 
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
of their concerns they never really got
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
details about how their loved one died
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the death
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
benefit this will provide a little
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
closure for those
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
families I think that's about all that I
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
questions um mother uh excuse me uh
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman I do have a question if I
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
may representative
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
O'Brien go
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
ahead um thank you for taking my
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
question uh when you say that the uh
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
commissioner is g to investigate every
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
single one will they be Prejudice
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
because accidents do happen such as uh
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the example if this employee wasn't
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
wearing his safety vest or something
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
like that would that deem make him thus
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
ineligible even though the tragedy did
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
exist and may beyond the cause of the
 
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.230 align:start position:0%
exist and may beyond the cause of the
safety

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
vest I would say rep I would say
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative that that would be one of
 
00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:51.670 align:start position:0%
representative that that would be one of
the

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
considerations that uh the commissioner
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
or whoever he assigns to investigate the
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
accident would look
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
into um if someone were
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
negligent and contributed to their own
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
death I'm sure that would be taken into
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
consideration our main concern is the
 
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
fact that right now at the scene of an
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
accident you have usually police and
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
fire um people cleaning up afterwards if
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh a a vehicle comes by and plows into
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
them they get this benefit but the
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
Public Works guy who is there sweeping
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
up the glass in the street gets killed
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the same accident and his family
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
benefit thank
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
right seeing no other
 
00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:50.630 align:start position:0%
right seeing no other
questions

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to call Marty Marty Carlin
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.789 align:start position:0%
 
system

00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
and Madame chairman just this is Pam
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
just to interject while you're sort of
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
between speakers I I wanted to let you
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
know that representative Judy has called
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
in but I'm unable to promote him to the
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
panelist side because I believe he
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
called in using the public attendee
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
phone number so I can enable him to
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
speak um from where he is or I'm also
 
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
sending him I'm hoping he's listening um
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sending him his personal uh you know
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
the information to call in and become a
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
that good morning everyone Madame chair
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
only but I I don't have any
 
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.029 align:start position:0%
only but I I don't have any
audio

00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
audio
 
00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
oh all right thank you we'll have to
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
now I I I made it to the participant
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
side if you want if I should start
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
speaking now Madam chair this is Marty
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair uh for the
 
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
record my name is Marty Carlin uh
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system um just as a technical
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
matter I just just wanted to let the
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee know you probably know this
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
from yesterday but there's a little bit
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
of a lag when you're moving from the
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
watching side to the participating side
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
so that's why there was a little dead
 
00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:51.559 align:start position:0%
time uh for my bik I just want to speak
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
to there's two parts to this bill House
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 536 the first in in most prominent
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
piece is the uh death benefit and that I
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that that is not
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Retirement System
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
benefit that's a separate statute and
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
just to speak briefly to section two um
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
which does affect the retirement system
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
in a very small way this uh section two
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh removes a offset to a
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
death benefit paid to a beneficiary um
 
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
if they are also receiving a regular a
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
monthly benefit from workers comp as a
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
result of the debt
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
um that uh offset only exists currently
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
for group one members um it already is
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
um doesn't exist for group two so this
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill would bring parody to group one and
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
group two uh you know uh by removing the
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
offset um from group one uh currently no
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
one is affected by this um offset um
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
fortunately um you know there aren't a
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
lot of line of duty deaths in group one
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh so um you know it wouldn't have a
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
significant ific fiscal impact um you
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
know removing this provision and um
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
typically folks the beneficiaries may be
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
receiving a workers comp benefit for a
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
period of time and then uh settle and
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
receive a lump sum um so it is it isn't
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
a a very big occurrence for us to apply
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
this offset um talking to our veterans
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
in the benefit side they've can probably
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
count on one hand how many times this
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
has happened so this is a very minor
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
change to our law and it only uh creates
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
parity between group one and group two
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
i' be glad to answer any questions if
 
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
any yes represent Roy thank you Tak my
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
question when you say parody between
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
group one and group two does that mean
 
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
all members of group one or just the
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
members who would fall under this um
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
under this Deb
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
benefit uh thank you representative
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
the um this this would affect all group
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
one me all group one members who die in
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
death see none thank you very much Mr
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
nor there we go I was muted um good
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
committee um thank you so very much for
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
allowing me this opportunity to testify
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
on health Bill 536 today I um I work for
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
the National Council on occupational
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
safety and health as representative
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
Schultz said and our mission is to
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
advance worker health and safety through
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
training education research and
 
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.590 align:start position:0%
training education research and
advocacy

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
um we support House Bill 536 because
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
while there is no monetary amount which
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
can compensate families for the loss of
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
a loved one All Families experience
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
Financial disruption when a loved one is
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
killed on the job um and I have written
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
testimony which I will email to the
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee and I don't really want to
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
read that however there were two points
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony that I would
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
like to make um one is that the state of
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has acknowledged for
 
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
decades in Department of Labor
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that public
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
employers are responsible for ensuring a
 
00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:28.360 align:start position:0%
safe workplace but but they've only
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
recently put this responsibility into
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
statute it's in RSA 277 col 1
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
B5 um but unfortunately we don't have a
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive system to ensure that
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
public employers follow generally
 
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
accepted safety procedures um as um
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
organizations in the private sector are
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
required and because of the lack of
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
resources devoted to training oversight
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
and whistleblower protections public
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
employees are actually at greater risk
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
of injur injur injury death um and
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
illness than their counterparts in the
 
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.549 align:start position:0%
illness than their counterparts in the
private

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
sector um and then the other thing that
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
is in my written testimony that I wanted
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
to point out is that Public Works
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
employees are defined as First
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
Responders in section two of the
 
00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security Act of
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
2002 um I think it's section six us code
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
101 because they provide immediate
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
Support Services during prevention
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
response and Recovery operations and so
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
this bill adds Public Works employees to
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
the list of First Responders entitled to
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
the death benefit under RSA
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
21 you guys probably know this better
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
than I do so but I really um I wanted to
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
spend a few minutes this morning talking
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
to you about my friend Allison Wooten
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
who could not be here today because of
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
work um
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and um she said she she
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
was tra she travels a lot for work and
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
she said she would try to listen so I
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
hope she um is okay with me speaking on
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
her behalf she did send me an email with
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
her thoughts on this bill um but what I
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is to to begin by telling
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
you how I met Alison Wooten um I met her
 
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.590 align:start position:0%
you how I met Alison Wooten um I met her
in

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
2017 I was at that time working for the
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire affiliate of my
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
organization and um she and her uh
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
children and other members of her family
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
came to a memorial dinner that the New
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Kosh and other Kos groups and
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
organizations around the country hold um
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
the last week of April which is
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
considered workers Memorial week to
 
00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:42.919 align:start position:0%
commemorate um the specific dinner in
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is to commemorate the um
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
those New Hampshire workers who um have
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
been killed on the job and we invite
 
00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
families from or we invite families um
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
that we can reach it's it's not an easy
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
task to track down everybody but to
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
attend a memorial and let them know that
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
their loved ones are not
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
forgotten and the thing that I remember
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
so specifically this was in April 2017
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
and Allison's husband Tom um was K was
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
died on the job in July of 2016 so this
 
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
is 10 months later and yet what I
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
remember was this sense you could almost
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
touch but you were afraid to touch them
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
because their pain was radiating off of
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
them they the the pain that this family
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
felt now you obviously it was somewhat
 
00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:35.799 align:start position:0%
heightened because of the
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
circumstances but
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
um and I remember at the time I had only
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
really started working with the families
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
of um workers killed on the job um not
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
long before and I remember being afraid
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
to even speak to Allison because I
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
didn't want to break her she she just
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
seemed so fragile
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
um and she didn't stay long I'll admit
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
and she cried anyway even though I
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
hardly spoke to her at all and um but
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
what I've come to learn is part of the
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
grieving process is to talk to people
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
about their loved ones and um I have
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
talked at length with Allison won and
 
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200 align:start position:0%
her daughter Samantha about Tom who was
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
a worker for the Northfield Department
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
of Public works when he was acting as a
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
flagger on July 21st
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
2016 and the public works department
 
00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:39.399 align:start position:0%
several members were moving a tractor or
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
moving a trailer um from one place to
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
another and they did this twice a year
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
and instead of putting the trailer on
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
the back of a truck designed to carry
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
this type of trailer the Department of
 
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
Public Works in an effort to save money
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
carried the trailer between two bucket
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
loaders like a two trucks like this and
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
it was you know going down the road and
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
they had Tom and I believe another
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
gentleman who were wearing their safety
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
vests by the way
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
um flagging traffic around this because
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
it was a very slow moving obviously and
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
um something came loose and Tom went to
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
secure it and he was crushed between the
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
trailer and the the truck that was
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
um as a person who works in the field of
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
workplace safety in health there are a
 
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
lot of things that I can say about this
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
that I won't because it's not
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate to this um situation however
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
make no mistake that Tom's death was a
 
00:28:50.669 --> 00:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
workplace fatality it was a workplace
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
trauma and he is has become a statistic
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
and so um I don't want him to remain a
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
statistic for you because this bill
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
really is about people and it's
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
about how do you make up for the loss of
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
a human being of a human life
 
00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:13.110 align:start position:0%
a human being of a human life
and

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
um you know Allison and Sam have become
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
friends of mine and I'm friends with
 
00:29:22.509 --> 00:29:22.519 align:start position:0%
them on Facebook and because of that
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
I've seen posts that they have on Tom's
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
birthday or on the anniversary of his
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
death and I feel like I know him a
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
little bit he um was an avid Sportsman
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
he liked snowmobiling and hunting and
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
fishing and um he was handy and he and
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
Alon came to New Hampshire because it
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
was their dream to live here in New
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and his job at the DPW was
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
sort of a semi-retirement job that he
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
enjoyed a lot it got he got to use a lot
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
of his skills and abilities and um you
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
know and he
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
did yes thank you Miss Nord I muted you
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
because although this
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
is fascinating it's not really relevant
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
to the bill so would you please confine
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony to how it affects this
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
particular Bill thank you very much
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
certainly Madam chair and I guess I
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
believe that it is relevant because it's
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
to understand the loss that
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
families experience and it's not just a
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
financial loss although Allison did lose
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
Tom's income and then when she was in
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
this situation of trauma where her
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
husband had just been killed and her
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
entire life plan has been
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
disrupted she's asked to make a choice
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
between accepting workers compensation
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
payouts or pension benefits or you know
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
there are so many decisions that come at
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
these families and not not only are they
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
in a financial pickle many of them from
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
the loss of income from the person who
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
was killed on the job but they are also
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
in an emotional state that is very
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
fragile and delicate um as any of you
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure can imagine it would feel to
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
lose your father your um your spouse
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
your any loved one really um and so this
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
bill does not make up for what Allison
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
lost it can't there is no person and
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
I've spoken since that time that I met
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
her I've spoken to
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
countless um family members who have had
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
have lost a loved one tragically on at a
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
in a workplace Fatality and not a single
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
one of them says yeah I got $100,000
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
from the state because my husband was
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
killed but what this can do and Allison
 
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
the reason that she asked me what she
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
could do and I approach representative
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
Schultz is
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that there
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
are Financial repercussions and it
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that the person who worked
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
for us as a community public workers
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
public employees um that they have value
 
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:25.480 align:start position:0%
and that their work has dignity and that
 
00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:28.519 align:start position:0%
we as a state appreciate and respect
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
that and I apologize for my tangent and
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
I will take any questions I will do my
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%

00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
when we ask why Public Works employees
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
why are we considering them I want you
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
to consider two two reasons I said a
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
more more accurately seven of the 10
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
most deadly occupations in the world are
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
part of our routine tasks that's reason
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
number one reason number two is when
 
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
conditions are at their worst when the
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
rivers are raging the roads are washing
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
out the floods are coming or have come
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
or we're in the middle of and we're
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
telling everybody else to stay home your
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
public works and do folks are coming to
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
work to safely close those roads re-root
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
just for no was sitting in that
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
okay please pleas thank you my name is
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative Daryl abis I I'm from
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County District 8 which is
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
Salem and I'm introducing this bill may
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
look familiar we did have this last year
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
I did pass in this committee with pass
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation Amendment 181 I believe
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
it passed the house floor with a roll
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
call vote of 275 to
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
41 the reason why I brought this
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
legislation I filed this bill last year
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
and refiling it is
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
we will high frequency of suicide wec in
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
our First Responders and believe in
 
00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:35.799 align:start position:0%
2018 it was eight First Responders that
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
committed suicide in the state of
 
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
newford which was much higher than the
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
TR and this higher rate of suicide
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
amongst First
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
Responders has been attributed to
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
PTSD suicide is a common symptom
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide or suicide thoughts
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
are often associated with
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
PTSD and the reason it's the PTSD is
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
associated with the high stress First
 
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
Responders L work it what this would do
 
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
creates that presumption that if the
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
first responder were to pass away by way
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
of suicide that he would be considered
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
related to their
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
profession there's no difference that if
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
a first responder suffer a physical
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
wound but sub subsequently come to that
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
wound several months later that can be
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
considered a line of duty death as well
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
we do have presumptions like um such as
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
with work workers from involving we
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
passed Bill a few years ago involving
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
fire fighters who diagnosed with cancer
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
because of their exposure to potential
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
Hazard chemicals there was a presumption
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
that the cancer was wa
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
to this policy is was been adopt already
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
by the United States military and so
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's been implemented and used
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
before and I understand this bill some
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
of the concerns I often hear with this
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill and at first glance is that this
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
bill would reward or encourage suicide
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's a fair question and
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't fault anyone for asking it but
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
I will say that based on what the line
 
00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
benefits are if someone were to do the
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
math I will say that often someone who
 
00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.549 align:start position:0%
math I will say that often someone who
is

00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
suicidal from what I understand they
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
they would not do the ma if they did
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
from an echnical perspective they
 
00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:25.950 align:start position:0%
from an echnical perspective they
actually

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't make sense for them to do
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
that whether it's their pension paying
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
them or whether they're working they
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
would make more money alive I don't
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
believe this would encourage or reward
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
suicide by by any of this what this does
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
is it simply provides a line ofy de
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
benefits to the surviving family of the
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
first respond
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately circum their
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
question Bry uh thank you for taking my
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
question represent um can you tell us
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
the history of this bill was this year
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
last year and
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
how so this was filed I this was filed
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
last year the second year last term it
 
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
was amended in in this committee it did
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
pass was an off pass with an amendment
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation of 181 in the committee
 
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
and then we actually voted on this I
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
believe on the marathon session we had
 
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
at 4: a.m. I think we voted on it and
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
that day it did pass that it was a roll
 
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
call and the roll call vote was 275 to
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
41 it then went on to the Senate it was
 
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
never act on in the Senate because of
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
the so this is just a refiling of that
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
now this is the filed version with the
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
amendment and that was my follow this is
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
the amended version from last yes thank
 
00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:50.710 align:start position:0%

these numbers are growing every year for

example in
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
2019 we had an all-time low in the
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
nation of 89 line of duty debts for
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
police officers however we had an

all-time high of recorded and
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%

suicides in the
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
country and is also I believe
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
representative abis also mentioned the
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
fact that the United States military has
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
recognized the necessity of paying out
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
benefits to survivors and the military
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
$400,000 uh payout for uh the survivors
 
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
of a suicided uh military
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
member as far as other uh first
 
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
respondents are concerned there's a
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
study out a recent study that shows that
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
more firefighters themselves died by
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
Suicide than in the line of duty deaths
 
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
beginning in
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
2017 it found that 103 firefighters and
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
140 police officers died by Suicide that
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
year compared to 93 firefighters and 129
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
officer line of duty deaths in
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
2018 in closing we would ask simply that
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
the committee find this still ought to
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
pass and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
question um I'm I'm sorry I should have
 
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
taken my hand down it was a question for
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
the last bill the last
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
speaker is he still around or by any
 
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:47.240 align:start position:0%
chance I believe so please ask your
 
00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:52.950 align:start position:0%
chance I believe so please ask your
question

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.549 --> 00:58:57.559 align:start position:0%
um um my question was last last year or
 
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
two years ago the um Edna added a
 
00:59:06.029 --> 00:59:06.039 align:start position:0%
sentence into that bill and um it's
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
still there in in the current version of
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
the bill and I just wanted to ask him if
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
he um felt comfortable with that
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
sentence or if maybe he he maybe thinks
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
it it's um can cause some issues in
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
terms of defining when the benefit
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
Goldstein I'm I'm actually not familiar
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
with which sentence you're referring to
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
but I do have the bill in front of me if
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.029 --> 00:59:50.039 align:start position:0%
reference I'm I'm sorry that question
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
was intended for the prime
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative fellows
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
representative abis specifically said
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
that he chose to to submit the the
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
amended version and that's what this is
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
he supports
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy has a question
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
for chief
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
Goldstein thank you for taking my
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
question Chief is is it it's my
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
understanding there's a currently a
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
death benefit a federal death benefit
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
for police officers killed in the line
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
of duty
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
and if if that's correct does it
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
currently recognize suicide or not uh
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
there is a death benefit uh quite
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't know if it does uh I can
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
certainly find out for you and uh would
 
01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:40.359 align:start position:0%

of that training includes information
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
about their own mental wellness and um I
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
first taught um about suicide of police
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
not just by police at the police academy
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
in 2008 we've continued to do that since
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
then um I uh Chief Goldstein is a tough
 
01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
act to follow I don't have much more to
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
add than what he has said other than
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
that you know the current Department of
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
Defense policiy to pay a death benefit
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
um and that that is not narrowly
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
interpreted to mean the person is on
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
duty at the time of death and I believe
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
that's the additional um sentence that
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
was added to uh by this committee last
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
year um and you know would reiterate the
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
information he said about the numbers um
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
and also uh which are more closely I
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
think aign for law enforcement but um
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
we're starting to get a better handle on
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
fire and EMS and those numbers are quite
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
high as well and uh just that um First
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
Responders put risk their lives every
 
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.990 align:start position:0%
Responders put risk their lives every
day

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
um often placing their wellbeing before
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
that of their of their families for our
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
wellbeing and families are the hardest
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
hit by a suicide death and I would urge
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
Goldstein may have some information as
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
well one of the um one of the biggest
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
challenges that we face is a culture of
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
um not asking for help among our um
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
first responder community and some of
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
that is um historical in nature relative
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
to the the jobs that they have and the
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
perception that if uh they ask for help
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
that it could negatively impact on their
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
careers there's been a lot of effort to
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
change that uh chief Goldstein is uh has
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
is and has been a leader in our state
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
around that um but there are um first of
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
all for anybody that um that is a state
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
employee for instance in Fire EMS um
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
there is uh Employee Assistance programs
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I believe most departments have that
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
as well but more importantly What's um
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
what's been developed in the last few
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
years particularly among the law
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community um but now
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
starting to see for fire and EMS our
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
peer support programs where trained um
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
police officers are not trained not to
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
be counselors but to be peer support um
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
for their fellow um fellow officers
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
there is there was was legislation
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
passed that provides confidentiality for
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
that so there's an extensive and
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
building network of peer support within
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
the state there are also um specialized
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
impatient units for instance um mlan
 
01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
Hospital in Boston has a first responder
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
um inpatient unit that's exclusive for
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
um for First Responders needing um
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
inpatient psychiatric care and then uh
 
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
Chief Goldstein also mentioned and he's
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
been a lead on the critical incident
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
stress debriefing teams and they will
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
respond after a critical incident to
 
01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
provide support and debriefing and again
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
it's predominantly peers um to uh to
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
some of these different
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
departments thank you very much I I know
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for um particularly
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
police and firefighters who uh deal with
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
deaths of um children many times on the
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
job and I know that's one of the issues
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%

01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I'd like to call
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%

I also represent the professional
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters of New Hampshire uh on the
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
commission to study incidents of
 
01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder and First
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
Responders uh during my remarks I'm
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
going to focus on firefighters and the
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
family of firefighters but this in no
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
way detracts from the serious effect
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
suicide is having on our other First
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
Responders and their families I've been
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
affected both personally and
 
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
professionally by firefighter suicide I
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
have friends that have uh completed
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
suicide and being being a firefighter
 
01:07:58.029 --> 01:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
peer supporter I have learned more than
 
01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
I ever thought I would about firefighter
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
suicide uh for me HB 91 is not just
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
about the members who lose to Suicide it
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
is about their families and helping take
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
care of a family that is suffered the
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
devastating loss a family quite often
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
makes sacrifices due to the nature of
 
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.349 align:start position:0%
makes sacrifices due to the nature of
the

01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
job and the uh and the impact it has on
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
family life I have also witnessed the
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
toll that suicide takes on other members
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
of fire department of their fire
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
departments often times their first
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts are of how they can help the
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
family and to help make sure the family
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
is supported both emotionally and
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
financially the passage of HB 91 will
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
help to alleviate some of the stress
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
worry and grief of firefighters
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
suffering with the loss of their friend
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
and fellow
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
firefighter knowing that the family will
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
receive the line a du death
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
benefit research shows that rates of
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
PTSD and acute stress are high among
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
firefighters research research also
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
shows that firefighters suffer with PTSD
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
have higher rates of suicides as opposed
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
to the general population through the
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
passing of of the PTSD bill for First
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
Responders and the state of New
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.799 --> 01:09:15.630 align:start position:0%
 
made

01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
questions can I just uh I just like
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
would like to add a little bit
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
more uh as as this time researchers
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledge there is very little data on
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
firefighter suicide and its effects on
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
family and the community uh this may be
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
result of stigma surrounding suicide the
 
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
PTSD Bill and hp91 will provide much
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
needed assistance in the short term in
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
the long term my hope is that by the
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire recognizing the
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
problem of firefighter suicide through
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
passing HB 91 more data will be made
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
available by families and fire
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
departments for further research into
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
firefighter suicide this will lead to
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
better suicide awareness training and
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention for other states
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
first for our state's First Responders
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%

you today in support of HB 91 relative
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
to the death benefits of First
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
Responders who die from suicide uh I
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
would ask that you see my written
 
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that I have submitted uh more
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
in depth on this subject um but I do
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
want to talk about uh a little bit about
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
the buildt here uh in the fire service
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
culture we've long been inspected to
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
portray a tough guy image the iconic
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
scene of firefighters doing the hard
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
physically demanding and dramatic work
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
easily comes to mind and this is
 
01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
oftentimes contrary to what the men and
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
women in this fire service are truly
 
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
feeling and
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
experiencing uh the PTSD the nightmares
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the depression just to name a few
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
all have a cumulative effect on the body
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
Brain according to the Journal of
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
Occupational Health approximately 20% of
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters and paramedics have
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
PTSD according to a 2015 Florida State
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh Florida State University study nearly
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
half of the firefighters surveyed uh
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
which was about
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
46.8% have thought about suicide 19.2%
 
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
of those had suicidal plans and 15.5%
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
had made suicide attempts because of
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
this impact on firefighters we have
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
worked tremendously hard to provide more
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
support in this area in 2015 the
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%

support program for its
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
members we have created uh a peer
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
support program much like this here in
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh that's made up of fire
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
service peers and mental health
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
clinicians and you heard about uh
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
Brother Wilson's testimony on this very
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
subject this focuses on active listening
 
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
skills suicide awareness and prevention

Behavioral Health Care Providers the
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
program has been invaluable for many of
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
our members who've been battling a wide
 
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
variety of be behavioral health issues
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
and uh again I welcome you to look at
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
our written testimony where you you'll
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
find more details on this program
 
01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
specifically uh we do recognize that we
 
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
have far more work to do in regards to
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
awareness and prevention um but we
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
believe that we've built a strong
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
foundation with this program
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh tragically we continue
 
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
to see many of our brothers and sisters
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
continue to lose their battles with
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder often
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
times Revolt uh resulting in an increase
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
in harmful behaviors that include
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
substance abuse self harm or
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
suicide we Face the harsh reality that
 
01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
despite our be best efforts of awareness
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
and prevention in providing a
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
a helping hand or a shoulder to cry on
 
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
there are simply some instances where
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
we're unable to make the save and in
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
these instances our responsibility turns
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
to the families of th those loved ones
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
lost those are the very same families
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
who support their loved one throughout
 
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
the many nights weekends and holidays
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
away from home many times 24 or 48 hours
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
at a time we owe it to these families to
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
provide some level of dignity and relief
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
in their life and while it won't bring
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
those loved ones back it will help to
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
ensure those families can begin to heal
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%

Division of State Police and that
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
follows a 32-year career where I retired

testimony but I do have a couple of
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
comments I think what we've heard from
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh this morning has been
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
incredibly um uh informative and I think
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
it's come from the right people but just
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
to add a couple of comments um I think
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
first of all the Department of Safety
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
Division of State Police is supporting
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
hp91 and I really want to thank each and
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
every one of you for the time uh
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative as for putting this
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
forward uh this is something that
 
01:16:57.629 --> 01:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
clearly gets looked at and I I was
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
involved over 15 years ago with putting
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
a peer counseling unit together with
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
State Police which was the fair the
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
first organized peer counseling unit in
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
in the state at the time and the one
 
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
thing that I think is is being left out
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to mention is the success
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
stories that we have in treating
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress and in treating
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh the incidents that affect
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
all First Responders and the saves that
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
we have although we have had many
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
suicides in my certainly in the last 35
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
years that I've been involved in being a
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
first responder and Public Safety there
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
has been many more that we have helped
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
and especially in the last few years so
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
the one thing that I think came of this
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to make sure everybody
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
heard was there were several questions
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
is this something that's going to uh
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to push people towards uh
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
you know death by Suicide is it
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
something that is going to it's going to
 
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
impact people that way you know the
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
answer in my my humble opinion is
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
clearly no what we have is we have more
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
people reaching out for help than ever
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
we have more help available to people we
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
have uh not only commissions and I serve
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
on the post-traumatic stress commission
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
and we were able to uh to pass some
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
legislation or help to get some
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
legislation passed last year with the
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
help of all of you uh to make a
 
01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
presumption for uh post-traumatic stress
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
as related to workman's comp which was
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
enormous um and when it relates to what
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
First Responders deal with and what
 
01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.709 align:start position:0%
First Responders deal with and what
drives

01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
drives
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh to that desperation to that point
 
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
where uh you know death by Suicide is
 
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
even something that's considered so I I
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted to let you know that there
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
is a lot going on and the uh Su the
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
state Suicide Prevention Council many
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
years ago U and I've been part of it for
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
over a decade started a law enforcement
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we've moved that and
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
since I have chaired it we have moved
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
that to the First Responders
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we're also going to
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
make uh we're going to bring in veterans
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
so veterans and First Responders and the
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
reason I say that is because there is an
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of attention that this
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
is getting Nationwide for the right
 
01:19:02.350 --> 01:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
reasons and you've heard testimony about
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
people unable to um to talk about it
 
01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
having to be the strong people as First
 
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
Responders unable to help ourselves all
 
01:19:12.669 --> 01:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
of those things are true but there is a
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
pivotal change and I think this bill
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
being where it is in today's society and
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
in in not only law enforcement the fire
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
service uh EMTs are dispatch Personnel
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
Communications Personnel all of that
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
matters and there could not be a more
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
timely uh application of this bill so I
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
really imploy you to fully support hp91
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
and know that behind uh all the concern
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
that comes from this committee and comes
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
from the representatives that brought
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
this bill forward are a group of people
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
both active retired and still in uh the
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
first responder community that have
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
recognized the issue that realize what
 
01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
the solution is and that are working
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
together uh like they've never worked
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
together before um so I I implore you to
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
to support it I thank you for all of the
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts I thank everyone for their
 
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
testimony today this is this has been an
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
incredible hearing and to get this to
 
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
the point where it has not only last
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
legislative season but to see it come
 
01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
back is is really heart warning for
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
families because in the end that's
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
really what we're talking about is the
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
collateral benefit for families uh that
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
have lost First Responders whether line
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
of do or death by Suicide and we all
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
know uh that there's many people left
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%

asked to be a co-sponsor on this bill
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%

representative trer and he has asked uh
 
01:24:07.149 --> 01:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
this committee to retain it because he
 
01:24:07.159 --> 01:24:08.910 align:start position:0%
this committee to retain it because he

01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%

working on three different amendments
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
that I knew of and therefore we wouldn't
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
be ready to properly evaluate
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%

and I'm here today to speak in
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
619 um while nhma recognizes the very
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
sign significant responsibility carried
 
01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
out by dispatchers across the state and
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
the critical Services they provide uh
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
particularly over the past year nh's
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislative policy positions oppose any
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
expanded benefits that would increase
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
current or future employer contribution
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
costs and just referencing the newly
 
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
certified employer contribution rates
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
which become effective on July 1st
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
dispatchers are currently classified in
 
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
group one employees which is uh
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
14.06% of payroll is the employer cost
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
and that would increase if they were to
 
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
be included as group two police to
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
33.88 per of payroll or for fire to
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
32.99 per of payroll uh which is more
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
than double the current employee rate
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
taking these rates and applying them to
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
annual ra wages which could range um an
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
estimated of40 to $60,000 for
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
dispatchers The increased cost to a town
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
or city resulting from this legislation
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
would range from 7,800 to 12,000 per
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
year per individual dispatcher and while
 
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
the impact of this bill would be
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
relatively minimal to a smaller
 
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
municipality it could be significant uh
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
very significant for larger cities who
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
have a number of both police and
 
01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:22.910 align:start position:0%
have a number of both police and
firefighters

01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
dispatchers but more concerning to nhma
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
is that by expanding the positions
 
01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
currently qualified in the
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
re of police and fire for this one
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
position uh dispatchers now it could set
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
a precedent and open the door for future
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
expansion of the group two membership
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
which of course would result in even
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
greater future additional employer cost
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
and with the loss of the state's share
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
of employer costs municipalities would
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
be required to assume 100% of the
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
increase in costs and for those reasons
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh we respectfully request you to vote
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
HB 619 and expedient to legislate that's
 
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
that's all I had to say thank you very
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
time any questions from the committee
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
represent lro I didn't have time to do
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
this research on my own I apologize for
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
that it's a simple question what's the
 
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
defining feature of a Group Two member
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a group one member group
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
one members um include police and
 
01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
teachers I'm sorry I said police group
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
one are employees of um employees and
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
fire

01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
follow Associated members of fire
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
departments such as maintenance
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
personnel and dispatches are explicitly
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
excluded from two may I follow up and
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question by the
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
way way but what is the I'm not asking
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
for a list of who's included in this
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
group I'm U I'm really after what are
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
the defining features of that group is
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
it risk to life is it uh hazardous
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
materials that's what I'm trying to get
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
at uh I I it's defined in RSA
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
7 which defines the requirements for
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
group one okay I'll we'll discuss it
 
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
after the he thank you
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
all right um thank you
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
jerkin thank you madam chair everybody
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh once again Jim Durkin
 
01:29:43.149 --> 01:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
legislative director foras me uh 4,000
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
public sector workers are under our
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
Union in New Hampshire including about
 
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
50 emergency dispatches working in 12
 
01:29:53.229 --> 01:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire municipalities in one
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
County and uh I'm here today on their
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
behalf to ask for your support for HB
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
619 which you know essentially would
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of years that'd be
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
required to work and what is widely
 
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
recognized as one of the most stressful
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
jobs in public service as a union
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
representing hundreds of Dispatchers in
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
four New England states we often refer
 
01:30:16.910 --> 01:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
to these professionals as the first of
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
our First Responders that's because they
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
are the very first people responsible
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
for helping others during the most
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
difficult tragic uh moments of their
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
lives Retirement Group classifications
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
and the justifications behind them vary
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
from state to state but in general
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
they're based on physical abilities and
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
emotional stress levels that ultimately
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
lead to very real physical problems and
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
the goal is to provide people with an
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to retire and enjoy some
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
decent healthy years before the toll of
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
the job results in debilitating health
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
problems that impacts their quality of
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
life and ultimately shortens that life
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh quick quick example in Massachusetts
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
our Corrections Officers are allowed to
 
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
retire with 50% of their pay after 20
 
01:30:59.310 --> 01:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
years regardless of their age and the
 
01:31:00.910 --> 01:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
idea is to get them into a new
 
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
occupation before they hit their 50s
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
because if they work Beyond 55 most are
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
dead before they hit the age of 62 and
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
but you know most people understand that
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
Corrections and police endure high
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
levels of stress they don't need to be
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
convinced but few realize how much
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
stress our dispatches endure every
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
single day on the job uh over time that
 
01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
emotional stress again manifest itself
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
in the form of physical ailments heart
 
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
disease high blood pressure it's because
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
the day is never routine or the same
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
within a single hour they can be found
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
handling an opioid overdose a fatal
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
crash and a house fire then when the
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
call ends they're required to do it all
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
over again every single day and they
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't just take and root the call
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're required to calm the caller as
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible and when needed
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
they're required to give immediate
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
life-saving advice over the phone until
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
emergency Personnel arrive they spend
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
their entire shifts dealing with people
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
in the most Panic moments of their lives
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
and those people's lives are dependent
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
on how quickly and efficiently they
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
react their dispatcher a few seconds of
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
delay or hesitation can mean the
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
difference between life or death so in
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
closing I want to say that a lot of our
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
dispatchers wanted to be here to share
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
some of their stories but most are
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
either on the job now resting up for the
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
second shift or sleeping after a long
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
shift so I'll end with one story told to
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
me years ago that still haunts me to
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
this day uh this particular dispatcher
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
took a call from an elderly gentleman
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
who awoke from a fire alarm and called
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
911 to ask for help because his only
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
exit from his third four apartment was
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
blocked by the
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
fire the dispatcher told me he knew
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
there was no hope for the man so he
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
stayed on the line with him he listened
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
in horror and Agony to his screams until
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
the fire took him and the line went dead
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry to have burden you with
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
the story but I felt compelled to tell
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
it with the hope that it'll give you
 
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
some understanding as to why this
 
01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:53.119 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed and why these
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
brave men and women need your help and
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know in particular to to to
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
stress that this shouldn't be about cost
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh it really really shouldn't so I thank
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
you for your time your consideration and
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
also all of you for your continued
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
dedication to Public Service during
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
fellows uh thank you um Mr Durkin can
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
you tell me if there are any other
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
states that put Dispatchers in the same
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
retirement uh not that I'm aware of in
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
our region representative uh we are
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
pursuing this we have quite a lot in
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh we came very close

pandemic a lot of a lot of good
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%

correctly uh the prime sponsors asked
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
for this bill to be retained because it
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
has some problems that is that uh is
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%

chair would be it and work on it over
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
the summer when we can get progress this
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%

welcome are there any other
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
none Madame chairman the representative
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
Traer is has has uh rejoined us and
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
we've labeled him by his full name so
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
he's easier to find on the
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
committee good morning I could not hear
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
question ask whether you to speak to the
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
committee considering we've already
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
to no at this point basically I am going
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
to ask that the bill be retained I feel
 
01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more research needs to
 
01:36:27.070 --> 01:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
be done before we bring the bill
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
forward thank you very much thank
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
you no one else has their hands raised
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
so I will close the
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
619 and open the hearing on House Bill
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
274 and call Representative O'Brien who
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.280 --> 01:37:07.229 align:start position:0%
 
sponsor

01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.239 --> 01:37:18.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
in that case representative Cushing is a
 
01:37:30.719 --> 01:37:43.149 align:start position:0%
in that case representative Cushing is a
co-sponsor

01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:43.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%

01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%

I'm also a proud sponsor of uh House
Bill

01:38:13.790 --> 01:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
274 what let me cut to the chase because
 
01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
the hour is late but basically what
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
is trying to get back what was once part
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the retirement system as you all know
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
they used to
 
01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.109 align:start position:0%
they used to
contribute

01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
contribute
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
35% you got wean down in tears go down
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
to basically zero when that occurs and
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
you don't really fix the whole complete
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
structure that means somebody's going to
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
make up to
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
35% and those people that are making it
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
up have been some of the stakeholders
 
01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
themselves members of that are paying
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
currently paying into the retirement
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
system but also this came down to each
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
individual City and town so that they
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
would be responsible to pay uh that
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
35% now I can speak about the city of
 
01:39:19.390 --> 01:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
Nash this has brought up uh about a $2
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
million charge
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh to pay into the uh the pension system
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
where does that money come from well
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
money as we all know money doesn't grow
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
from trees so it comes from the
 
01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so one could say by the state
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
alleviating the responsibility of
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
35% has cost an additional tax to the
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of all communities throughout
 
01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:46.870 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of all communities throughout
the

01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
state it is the hope of complying with
 
01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
that uh uh we can alleviate that let's
 
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
look what cities and towns and all
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
across our state are going through uh I
 
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
can say in the that's common Al all
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are paying into this
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
but also I can speak for Manchester and
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
ashaa the homeless population the opioid
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
problems the other different things that
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
come up that kind of eat into the
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
taxable structure and now on top of it
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
you got to pay into the retirement
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
system so therefore the intention of
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
this to sum it all up is trying to get
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
the state back into realizing that
 
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities need the help with the co
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
that'ss around right now municipalities
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
need a relief this is no longer anything
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
that municipalities can absorb they need
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
to help to get back to some degree and
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully within the 15% that uh will
 
01:40:55.709 --> 01:40:55.719 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the municipal burden
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
into the retirement C and uh Madame
 
01:41:02.669 --> 01:41:02.679 align:start position:0%
chair if I can ask I would uh hope you
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
have on your speakers list uh the people
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
that can really get into the Weeds on
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
this much better than I can would be his
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh honor the mayor of the city of Nashua
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
James dcas and his CFO John Griffin so
 
01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
if you could recognize him at some point
 
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
when you're ready to speak would greatly
 
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
conclude I look for representative for
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
Mr John just because he signed up to
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%

01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
we have a handout on this one uh NHS
 
01:43:06.589 --> 01:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
Bill brief HB 274 if you have that uh
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
with you it just provides a little bit
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
of a background history on the state
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
contribution subsidy for local costs of
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
teachers police and fire uh which was
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh eliminated back in 20 12 I believe um
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
and also just a summary of the fiscal
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
note that's attached to the bill uh
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
which would show the state cost uh at a
 
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
5% contribution for local employers uh
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
for those three member groups um this is
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
not an Actuarial bill or has will have
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
no impact on employer contribution rates
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
for nhrs uh this is simply somebody else
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
will be paying uh you know some a share
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
of the local cost to nhrs but the you
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
know the total net amount coming in will
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
be the same uh I'd be glad to answer any
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
have I don't see any questions from the

support of HB 274 and I have also
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee written
 
01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
testimony restoring the state's share of
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
employer costs for police teachers and
 
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
firefighters has been a longstanding
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
policy of nhma While most political
 
01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions in New Hampshire also
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
participate in the retirement system for
 
01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.270 align:start position:0%
participate in the retirement system for
their

01:44:54.270 --> 01:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
employees participation is mandatory
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
under statute for police fire and
 
01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
teacher members the state's contribution
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
which was originally 40% in 1967 before
 
01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
being reduced to 35% in 77 was also
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
mandatory the legislation amending the
 
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
statute in 20111 to eliminate completely
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
the state's 35% share for police fire
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
and feuture employer cost has been one
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the largest fiscal impacts upon
 
01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities in Des in decades in just
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
the eight-year period from 2013 to
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
2020 the elimination of the state share
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
has amounted to an increase in the
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
employer contributions required to be
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
paid by political subdivisions of over
 
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.830 align:start position:0%
paid by political subdivisions of over
$720

01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
$720
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
million the current 6 billion unfunded
 
01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
liability which was amortised over 30
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
year period ending in
 
01:45:55.270 --> 01:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
2039 is required to be paid through the
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
employer contributions and the state
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
also had a 35% share in paying this
 
01:46:00.239 --> 01:46:02.430 align:start position:0%
also had a 35% share in paying this
long-standing

01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
long-standing
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
obligation the elimination of the state
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
share of the employer cost has
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
downshifted this state level financial
 
01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the local taxpayers
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
whose Municipal County and local school
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
property tax rates have all increased
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
over the past eight years to raise the
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
property tax revenue necessary to fund
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
the additional 729 million in Municipal
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
School District and County employer
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
costs which are mandatory for police
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
firefighters and teachers although a 5%
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
17.66% share estimated to be
 
01:46:49.149 --> 01:46:49.159 align:start position:0%
12362 million this bill would provide
 
01:46:51.589 --> 01:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
some immediate and needed relief to
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions and help offset
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
the major rate increase which becomes
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
effective July 1st we respectfully ask
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
that you vote in favor of HB 274 and
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
again thank you for your
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none mayor
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
dones um well thank you madam chair and
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I uh see um
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
Mike O'Brien representative Mike O'Brien
 
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
who's also on city government with me so
 
01:47:28.109 --> 01:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
uh I'm glad to be before
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
you we are asking here that the state as
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
you just
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
heard uh return to contributing a small
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
amount towards Municipal
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
pensions now the problem here is that
 
01:47:43.310 --> 01:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns across New
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are the victims of a broken
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
promise the way the state retirement
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
system was formed the way way the reason
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
that so many municipalities are in the
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
system and and basically all
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities are part of it is that
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
when the is that the state
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
promised that in order and induce the
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
communities to enter the system by
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
promising that if the communities
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
entered the state would pay first 45
 
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
well 40% as you just heard would pay
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
40% and of course that was
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
a very an attractive inducement and most
 
01:48:26.189 --> 01:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
in all cities and towns basically joined
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
the state retirement system that was
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
reduced to 35 but that was you know a
 
01:48:33.589 --> 01:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
very modest reduction and probably
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
didn't upset too many people or at at
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
the time back in the back in the
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
70s uh then as you've already heard uh
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
both from the previous speakers in
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
around 2011 the amount of the
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
contribution was reduced to zero this
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
has worked an incredible hardship on
 
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
cities and towns across the state the
 
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
result of a big increase in
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
costs um has meant always means I think
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with local budgets
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
always means a combination of a tax
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
increase with a reduction of
 
01:49:16.589 --> 01:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
services so there's no question that we
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know not only have local taxes been
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
driven up because of this but also
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
quality of
 
01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
schools police protection and other
 
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
other services provided by cities and
 
01:49:30.910 --> 01:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
towns has also been affected again most
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
cities and towns handle a big increase
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
by kind of
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
balancing uh some tax increase with some
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
Services now what has happened is that
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
you'll hear more about this this
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon but that the retirements and
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
and so over the years as a result of
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
decisions made at the state level not by
 
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
the local communities somehow the system
 
01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:56.669 align:start position:0%
the local communities somehow the system
got

01:49:56.669 --> 01:49:56.679 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
underfunded and this was a result of
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
probably making decisions to extend
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
benefits the system couldn't afford uh
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
to not you know maybe the management of
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
assets maybe the U not charging back you
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
know some years ago what should have
 
01:50:11.239 --> 01:50:12.030 align:start position:0%
know some years ago what should have
been

01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
charged and so as a result of the
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
decision to reduce
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
the assumed rate of return which is that
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
that part of it is mandatory you know
 
01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
they they have to use fiduciary
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make that decision but
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
as a result of being of that decision
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
being made communities are now being hit
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
come July 1
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
2021 with another huge increase for us
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
in Nashville and I just give you our
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
figures not because we are different or
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
more important or anything else but just
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
to give you some this is the numbers I
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
know our increase is four4 m million do
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
which is already a 2% uh tax increase
 
01:50:57.069 --> 01:50:57.079 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers of nashille on top of
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
a reduction of school aid uh so this is
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
this is a very big hit and
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
the this hit comes at a at exactly the
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
wrong time I we were struggling with the
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
covid-19 The increased costs decreased
 
01:51:16.510 --> 01:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
revenues as a result of that pandemic uh
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
the prospect that real estate values in
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
the commercial areas
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
could certainly go down as a result of
 
01:51:25.069 --> 01:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
the pandemic raising residential
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
property taxes so this is working a huge
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
hardship and of course we have
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
additional costs related to The Learning
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
Gap that is resulting because aren't
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
going to school things like that so the
 
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
5% bill which you have before you would
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
not completely offset the increase that
 
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh is being made by uh as a result of
 
01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
the reduction in thetive return it might
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
reduce that impact by about uh you know
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
half so for Nashville maybe we would the
 
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
increase would be two million rather
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
than four but as I said at the beginning
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
all of the cities and towns whom you
 
01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
represent are the victims of a broken
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
promise again I'll just give you Nash's
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
figures that broken promise has already
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
cost the the citizens of Nasha $74
 
01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.629 align:start position:0%
cost the the citizens of Nasha $74
million

01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:21.639 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:52:24.109 --> 01:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh money that could be I mean we could
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
the new Middle School we cash almost if
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
we had that money back so we're asking
 
01:52:32.229 --> 01:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
some you to help us with some relief
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
here uh taxpayers and communities across
 
01:52:38.069 --> 01:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
the state really need this and of course
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
I am certainly available for questions
 
01:52:44.069 --> 01:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
committee

01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:54.830 align:start position:0%
committee
representative

01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair Mr
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
Mayor I know you have not been
 
01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
mayor for a substantially long time but
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
do you recall the city of NASA ever
 
01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
objecting in the
 
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
1990s when the bill seemed to go
 
01:53:17.189 --> 01:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
away when what when the bill from the
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
state when the state legislature decided
 
01:53:24.109 --> 01:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
to give a moratorium on the bill to into
 
01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
the pension system in the 1990s I mean
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
this this current situation we're in is
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
is a combination of of faults and errors
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
if you will and well my my answer is
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
first of all I wasn't in city government
 
01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
then but right I mean in a way why
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
should they I mean they're relying on
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to run this
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
system we're not part of the running
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
they say that they don't need money what
 
01:53:53.310 --> 01:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
how would anyone question that so um
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that was a huge huge mistake and
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers at the
 
01:54:01.149 --> 01:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
time I'm sure benefited from it but that
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
was 25 years ago and um again what are
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
we you know what what communities across
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
the state are told this the retirement
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
system doesn't need money by the people
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
who supposedly know what they're
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
doing um we don't have a sex separate
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
Actuarial analysis or anything like that
 
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
we don't you know who what do we know so
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
okay um you don't need the money so why
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
charge us but so that that mistake was I
 
01:54:33.629 --> 01:54:33.639 align:start position:0%
don't think you can blame the
 
01:54:35.470 --> 01:54:35.480 align:start position:0%
communities for a decision like that
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I hope you can
 
01:54:53.239 --> 01:54:54.310 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I hope you can
hear

01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:54:58.830 --> 01:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
me yes great um my name is Dennis Corgan
 
01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm uh testifying as a member of of
 
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
the public opposed to HB
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
274 I'm also speaking on behalf of the
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
Granite State taxpayers I'm a board of
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
directors member of GST and we are the
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
oldest Statewide taxpayer group in New
 
01:55:20.109 --> 01:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm a retired pension actuary
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
and I was appointed by Governor cunu to
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
be on the uh desial Commission in 2017
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
as a public expert member when we
 
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
studied the New Hampshire retirement
 
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
system and recommended legislative
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
changes we are here to oppose HB 274 and
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
I've sent uh some written testimony but
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
I mistakenly sent as an attachment I'd
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
be glad to resend that as a body of an
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
email if that's more convenient for you
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
we have two main concerns about uh this
 
01:55:56.030 --> 01:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
bill the first is that by shifting part
 
01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
of the cost of funding these these um
 
01:56:03.149 --> 01:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal pensions to the state there'll
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
be inevitably a tendency to increase
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
benefits on the part of the plan
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
sponsors the
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
towns because uh in that way um they can
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh increase benefits without having to
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
pay the full value of uh the F the full
 
01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
cost of these
 
01:56:26.430 --> 01:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
improvements the second uh item I'd like
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
to mention is that uh the increase from
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
a 0% State share to a 5% State share is
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
a is an enormous step but the ratchet
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
effect will inevitably mean that moving
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
from 5% to larger uh percentage shares
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
will come they'll be very difficult to
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
resist the calls for that and I noted um
 
01:56:54.910 --> 01:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative o'ban was already talking
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
15% so I would urge the committee to
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
vote in expedient to legislate on this
 
01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd be glad to take any
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any thank you Mr
 
01:57:16.750 --> 01:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
Griffin yes uh Madam chair can you hear
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you me Madam chair
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name for
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
the record is John L Griffin I'm the
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
Chief Financial Officer for the city of
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
Nashua and I'm pleased to prepare these
 
01:57:34.990 --> 01:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
remarks for you folks and we'll follow
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
up with an email as indicated uh by m
 
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
dones we are in difficult times for two
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
reasons one is the increase in the
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
employer rates for the city pursuant to
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the assumed rate of
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
return that number as projected in
 
01:57:58.069 --> 01:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 is a $4.4 million increase so
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
if the committee and the legislature put
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
in a 5% contribution that would be 1.2
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
million off that 4.4 so that's the
 
01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
specifics in that regard a
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
15% uh contribution would be 3.7 million
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
not quite equal to the U increased
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the reduction of the return
 
01:58:23.950 --> 01:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh assume rate of return uh another this
 
01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
is a big item for the city of Nashua we
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
anticipate spending about 25 million
 
01:58:32.069 --> 01:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
this year in contributions for police
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
fire teachers and
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
employees number is going to be 29
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
million plus in fiscal
 
01:58:43.709 --> 01:58:43.719 align:start position:0%
22 and as mayad Don just indicated every
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
2 million increase in costs or decrease
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
in revenue is
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
1% on the tax rate so we're struggling
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
at this point in time given the pandemic
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
and um any any relief that we could get
 
01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
would certainly uh help us weigh those
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
balances that we make every year between

I just noticed I've had about a dozen
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of written testimony on these
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
bills in my
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
email sent it to the entire committee so
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
that should be uh available to all of us
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
comment Adam Cher what is the where's
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
the location of your microphone because
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
you are extraordinarily hard to
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
hear I'm sorry I couldn't understand
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
you I'll I'll try to do it without my
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
accent the location of your
 
02:00:50.669 --> 02:00:50.679 align:start position:0%
microphone Carol it's very difficult to
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
hear you it's too far away from
 
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
you okay is that
 
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
better much better better you for for
 
02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.589 align:start position:0%
better much better better you for for
the

02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
feedback Madam chair if I can um just as
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
a matter of feedback uh I don't know
 
02:01:12.189 --> 02:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
about anyone else but I can hear the
 
02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
folks who are testifying remotely much
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
better than any of you who are speaking
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
room uh I don't know if that's something
 
02:01:26.069 --> 02:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
that the tech folks could work on but
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
just like I said as a matter of feedback
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
if if everybody else that's uh listening
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
in remotely agrees with that I think
 
02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's something that hopefully can be
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
remedied 100% agree thank you did um
 
02:01:44.550 --> 02:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
Madam Madam chair I would also like to
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
ask that um because the remote people
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
are so so much louder I have to turn the
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
volume down when I'm listening to them
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then to hear people in your room I
 
02:01:59.470 --> 02:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
have to turn it up again so if you could
 
02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
when you ask the if you say when are
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
there any more questions for the speaker
 
02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
if you could wait like you know 10
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
seconds or so to give people just a
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
chance to you know hear what's going on
 
02:02:16.270 --> 02:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
and to uh get their hand up that would
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
be useful too thank you I will have the
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
tech people come in and balance the
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
volumes we had to boost the volume of
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
the remote people earlier because we
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear you
 
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a learning
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
experience since there don't appear to
 
02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
be any more comments on House Bill 274
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the hearing we resume
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
at5 on the ACT House Bill
 
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
130 and we will attempt to get our
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
technical issues solved in the meantime
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.880 --> 02:05:37.470 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
Madame chairman I think I see you there
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
but um you're muted so you can't talk to
 
02:05:44.669 --> 02:05:44.679 align:start position:0%
me but Scott Kelly's on his way he
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:08:55.549 align:start position:0%
 
minute

02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
want Morning
 
02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
has okay how do I sound
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
here it sounds good it's certainly not
 
02:09:13.629 --> 02:09:13.639 align:start position:0%
um too loud at all but it's I I could
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
hear most of what was going on it's just
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
that um I think it's sometimes a
 
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire might have turned
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
you know turned your head or you know
 
02:09:25.390 --> 02:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
sort of turned away from the mic but
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
when you spoke right on it it was loud
 
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:29.030 align:start position:0%
when you spoke right on it it was loud
and

02:09:29.030 --> 02:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:31.950 --> 02:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
clear I will have to behave better I
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
know it's it's and you're looking around
 
02:09:35.950 --> 02:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
at the you know hands in the room or
 
02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
whatever else it's it's um it's
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
definitely a a learning process okay so
 
02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
so you will share your screen with the
 
02:09:50.990 --> 02:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
can you hear me right here I can loud
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
and clear
 
02:09:59.229 --> 02:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
or loud and clear but but you know
 
02:10:03.149 --> 02:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
you've got a nice strong voice too right
 
02:10:05.310 --> 02:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
well I move the
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
room mic right front as well she'll have
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
both mics
 
02:10:15.629 --> 02:10:15.639 align:start position:0%
okay still good that's
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
good one thing we need to talk about
 
02:10:21.549 --> 02:10:21.559 align:start position:0%
Scott um we had our first testimony from
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
a from an in-person member you know a
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
member of another committee came in and
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
testified and he didn't have we didn't
 
02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
have a setup for him to testify so he
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
just sort of stood near the table and he
 
02:10:35.709 --> 02:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
was the hardest speaker for me to
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
hear okay so I don't know what the
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
solution to that is I'm just throwing it
 
02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
out where we are having you know he was
 
02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
a chairman of I think criminal justice
 
02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
and they're meeting in another room this
 
02:10:49.629 --> 02:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
morning so he came in to to um speak to
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
his bill in
 
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
Edna okay um so the committee yesterday
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
put a table out in the middle and when
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to speak they the table
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
and I do

02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:46.790 align:start position:0%
you know I didn't expect
that

02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:48.750 --> 02:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
I think the chairman knew about it but
 
02:38:51.269 --> 02:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
um she I hadn't
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
heard I'll set up a station
 
02:38:56.950 --> 02:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
anyway that would be perfect that would
 
02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:59.590 align:start position:0%
anyway that would be perfect that would
be

02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:01.750 --> 02:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
great I
 
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I I don't know I don't want to
 
02:39:06.269 --> 02:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
mess up the the mic system especially if
 
02:39:09.510 --> 02:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:23.429 align:start position:0%
 
I

02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:26.269 --> 02:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
okay so all the sound fine
 
02:39:28.510 --> 02:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
now it sounds great where you're
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
standing I think people need to project
 
02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
some you know I don't know if that's
 
02:39:35.230 --> 02:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
part of
 
02:39:37.830 --> 02:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
it right I move mic's closer to some
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
people so I
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:44.640 --> 02:39:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
Scott

02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay so you think you're all set with
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
me yes I am thank you okay I'm gonna
 
02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:14.550 align:start position:0%
me yes I am thank you okay I'm gonna
mute

02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:14.560 --> 02:54:43.269 align:start position:0%
 
myself

02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.279 --> 03:34:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:34:29.630 --> 03:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly happy with having the
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
print out prior to uh
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh from 30 minutes before FL that seems
 
03:34:40.750 --> 03:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
to work yeah I mean there was like
 
03:34:42.349 --> 03:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
complaint that somebody had registered
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
and they weren't on the list it's
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
because he registered late so yeah Don
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
just didn't register as Donas he
 
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
register National mayor and my eyes just
 
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
skip right over that right and you know
 
03:34:55.750 --> 03:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
like representative travier came on at
 
03:34:55.760 --> 03:34:57.189 align:start position:0%
like representative travier came on at
Doug

03:34:57.189 --> 03:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
Doug
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
T you know I didn't know his first name
 
03:35:02.670 --> 03:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
this is so reminiscent of all the
 
03:35:04.750 --> 03:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
headline hollering about the
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinations you got millions going on
 
03:35:10.349 --> 03:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
what do you expect yes some are going to
 
03:35:13.830 --> 03:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
thought out die that's too bad but come
 
03:35:17.830 --> 03:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
on I yeah it's I think we've got a a
 
03:35:19.870 --> 03:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
decent system and people are learning
 
03:35:21.830 --> 03:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it'll get
 
03:35:24.510 --> 03:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
better wonderful
 
03:35:29.469 --> 03:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
you Pam have we solved the the technical
 
03:35:47.630 --> 03:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
morning I believe so they were in trying
 
03:35:52.590 --> 03:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
to equalize the
 
03:35:56.429 --> 03:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
volumes my problem was not put right by
 
03:35:59.229 --> 03:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
the microphone is my problem and we'll
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
do what we
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
can right well if it's as simple as
 
03:36:06.910 --> 03:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
moving the microphone closer to you that
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
would be great I mean you are hard to
 
03:36:13.110 --> 03:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
hear if you're if if for for those of us
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
who are on the
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
zoom we can hear each other fine but we
 
03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
just can't hear you too well and Terry
 
03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
we can hear fine but we but he does talk
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
very much so it doesn't make any
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
difference yes well
 
03:36:29.630 --> 03:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's I can hear Tony I can hear Tony
 
03:36:31.710 --> 03:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
leus pretty well
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
too and and the there are a bunch of the
 
03:36:36.189 --> 03:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
the new people I don't know where they
 
03:36:39.229 --> 03:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
are I don't see them on the zoom but I
 
03:36:41.510 --> 03:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
can hear them every once no while but
 
03:36:43.150 --> 03:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's not happening
 
03:36:46.349 --> 03:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
is the the speaker is not is not popping
 
03:36:50.269 --> 03:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
up on the the main screen all the time
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
with that's one of your settings in your
 
03:36:55.710 --> 03:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
Zoom you
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
have and and speaker mode I'm seeing
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
those so yeah I think that's something
 
03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:02.710 align:start position:0%
those so yeah I think that's something
with

03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:37:06.189 --> 03:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
your contr peter I can't
 
03:37:08.790 --> 03:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
help okay well I I didn't know I I had
 
03:37:12.830 --> 03:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
an option there forgot I got my video
 
03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
on so but they're not talking much
 
03:37:18.670 --> 03:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
anyway so it's not a big
 
03:37:23.710 --> 03:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:25.950 --> 03:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
Carol I hope
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
so okay as far as you're concerned
 
03:37:35.950 --> 03:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:39.389 --> 03:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
150 that's where the extra few pounds
 
03:37:39.399 --> 03:37:40.950 align:start position:0%
150 that's where the extra few pounds
are

03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:37:44.349 --> 03:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
I didn't realize that move over you like
 
03:37:46.830 --> 03:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:46.840 --> 03:38:09.309 align:start position:0%
 
I

03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:09.319 --> 03:38:12.429 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:38:12.429 --> 03:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:14.550 --> 03:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
I've got them you got them already this
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
one just
 
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
arrived is this 130
 
03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yourself I'm very
 
03:38:24.309 --> 03:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
organized impr all printed out in
 
03:38:27.870 --> 03:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
sequence with my nasty comments already
 
03:38:30.429 --> 03:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
already okay well I
 
03:38:32.830 --> 03:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
didn't I knew they would be here so I
 
03:38:36.150 --> 03:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
didn't do that it it appears that
 
03:38:39.110 --> 03:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson has developed the
 
03:38:41.030 --> 03:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
need for a shade
 
03:38:44.309 --> 03:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
dentist I thought maybe he had plastic
 
03:38:56.429 --> 03:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%

spat between these two agencies for a
 
03:43:07.550 --> 03:43:07.560 align:start position:0%

03:43:15.149 --> 03:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
retirement system in the first position
 
03:43:17.070 --> 03:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
and the amendment which you should have
 
03:43:21.510 --> 03:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
all received through email uh has the
 
03:43:24.389 --> 03:43:24.399 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services in
 
03:43:27.790 --> 03:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
the first position Mr Carlin spoke to me
 
03:43:31.469 --> 03:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
about this bill actually two years ago
 
03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
and uh I attempted to put it as an
 
03:43:36.590 --> 03:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
amendment on a bill last year but as we
 
03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
all know last year got sort of
 
03:43:39.120 --> 03:43:41.070 align:start position:0%
all know last year got sort of
bamboozled

03:43:41.070 --> 03:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
bamboozled
 
03:43:43.870 --> 03:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm bringing it forward as a clean
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
bill this year and it's going to be up
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
to the legislature to determine who
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
should Prevail and I believe that there
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
are representatives from both agencies
 
03:43:58.990 --> 03:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
here who can present their respective
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
positions and then we will go from there
 
03:44:04.550 --> 03:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
so unless there are any other questions
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
or any other co-sponsors wish to speak
 
03:44:11.309 --> 03:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
um you may proceed with those
 
03:44:13.750 --> 03:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
folks are there any questions from any
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
members see none the chair will
 
03:44:25.389 --> 03:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.229 --> 03:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
retirement thank you Mr chair um for the
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is Marty Carlin
 
03:44:30.990 --> 03:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
03:44:33.790 --> 03:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
retirement system I'd like to thank
 
03:44:36.429 --> 03:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
representative Shu for introducing uh
 
03:44:39.070 --> 03:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and the amendment essentially
 
03:44:41.590 --> 03:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
although um we're very close and work
 
03:44:43.630 --> 03:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
very well with Das I wouldn't categorize
 
03:44:46.229 --> 03:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
our disagreement as a an interpretation
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
as a spat but um I do do want to briefly
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
explain um you know what the medical
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
subsidy is and what the what the issue
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
in question the bill is addressing um or
 
03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks to address um basically
 
03:45:03.910 --> 03:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar with it we
 
03:45:05.229 --> 03:45:05.239 align:start position:0%
covered it a little bit in the
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
orientation presentation the medical
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
subsidy isn't an insurance benefit uh
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
rather it's it's a premium offset um
 
03:45:16.630 --> 03:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
applied uh uh if the retiree is paying
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
for insurance from their former employer
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
out of pocket um it works a little bit
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
different for the state because uh State
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
retirees are insured through the state
 
03:45:29.590 --> 03:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
so um you know and the plan was closed
 
03:45:31.870 --> 03:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
for group one members uh about more than
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
a decade ago for for state employees
 
03:45:37.830 --> 03:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
actually back in 2004 uh for um Public
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
Safety uh group two um there are some
 
03:45:42.269 --> 03:45:42.279 align:start position:0%
people who are still active who will
 
03:45:44.910 --> 03:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
qualify for the benefit when they retire
 
03:45:47.309 --> 03:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
but it is a closed group so essentially
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
this benefit U will eventually no longer
 
03:45:53.309 --> 03:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
exist once the eligible membership uh
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
population is gone um the question um
 
03:45:58.990 --> 03:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
and our the subsidies was originally
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
introduced back in the late 80s early
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
90s so the question is in I believe in
 
03:46:09.269 --> 03:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
2009 the state uh the legislature put a
 
03:46:12.750 --> 03:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
a Premium cost Associated for State
 
03:46:16.110 --> 03:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
retirees and um you know our
 
03:46:18.269 --> 03:46:18.279 align:start position:0%
longstanding administrative practice was
 
03:46:20.590 --> 03:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
to pay the subsidy amount prior to
 
03:46:22.990 --> 03:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
taking any authorized deduction uh
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's a phrase in the statute
 
03:46:28.590 --> 03:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh 100 A52 that says shall pay the cost
 
03:46:31.229 --> 03:46:31.239 align:start position:0%
and um you know we we read that as an
 
03:46:33.790 --> 03:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
obligation for an HRS uh to pay the full
 
03:46:37.229 --> 03:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
subsidy um our understanding and and I
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll leave the details to the
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
folks at T I don't want to speak for
 
03:46:43.710 --> 03:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
them um you know but there's another
 
03:46:45.389 --> 03:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
piece of the statute that refers to
 
03:46:48.229 --> 03:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
which shall the U the phrase which shall
 
03:46:50.229 --> 03:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
be in addition to a notwithstanding any
 
03:46:52.990 --> 03:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
amounts payable to the retirement system
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
um to uh put the put the deduction ahead
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the subsidy application so really um
 
03:47:01.990 --> 03:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
we brought this question to our Board of
 
03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
Trustees and they authorized staff to
 
03:47:06.750 --> 03:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
seek clarifying legislation on the
 
03:47:09.950 --> 03:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
intent of when they um the state Rey
 
03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
premium is applied before or after the
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
subsidy is applied uh to the cost uh we
 
03:47:18.349 --> 03:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
truly don't have a specific uh a a
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
outcome or position on this bill we're
 
03:47:22.389 --> 03:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
just looking for administrative Clarity
 
03:47:22.399 --> 03:47:26.030 align:start position:0%
just looking for administrative Clarity
moving

03:47:26.030 --> 03:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:33.150 --> 03:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:33.160 --> 03:47:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:47:36.870 --> 03:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:40.110 --> 03:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you yes I I was just curious
 
03:47:44.590 --> 03:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
Marty if um the retirement system has in
 
03:47:44.600 --> 03:47:46.189 align:start position:0%
Marty if um the retirement system has in
fact

03:47:46.189 --> 03:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
fact
 
03:47:49.870 --> 03:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
searched uh the section of the RSA that
 
03:47:53.070 --> 03:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
authorizes your position uh as to
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
legislative intent at the time it was
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
adopted um I believe our legal folks
 
03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
looked at that and didn't didn't see
 
03:48:06.030 --> 03:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
anything in the record indicative either
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
way thank
 
03:48:08.439 --> 03:48:09.990 align:start position:0%
way thank
you

03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:48:12.149 --> 03:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the
 
03:48:14.429 --> 03:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
members I'm going to recognize myself
 
03:48:17.309 --> 03:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
for a quick question could you explain
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
um just briefly what the plus or minus
 
03:48:21.750 --> 03:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
is to the employee on
 
03:48:26.149 --> 03:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
this uh it it it for the state side it
 
03:48:28.309 --> 03:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
may be U invisible it's it's going to
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
depend because typically uh retire
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums are higher than the
 
03:48:34.830 --> 03:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
subsidy amount the subsidy amount was
 
03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
frozen back in um 2008 so um it's really
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
um you know if if if there's a case
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
where the premium is close enough to the
 
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
subsidy that it would cover the full
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
cost of the benefit then the if they
 
03:48:51.790 --> 03:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
were assess the state premium they would
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
be paying some out of pocket for that um
 
03:48:56.990 --> 03:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
you know if if the uh premium was
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
applied first um you know for for
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
anybody who's on the predicare health
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
insurance which is is more more costly
 
03:49:06.990 --> 03:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
plan um the spread between the actual
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
cost of the benefit and the subsidy is
 
03:49:12.269 --> 03:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
is quite
 
03:49:15.030 --> 03:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
wide I see representative fellows would
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
like to ask a question um yes thank you
 
03:49:20.469 --> 03:49:20.479 align:start position:0%

03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
good thank you um the wonders of modern
 
03:51:32.710 --> 03:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
technology um I'm Charlie Arling housee
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm the uh Commissioner of
 
03:51:34.080 --> 03:51:35.189 align:start position:0%
I'm the uh Commissioner of
administrative

03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
Services um and uh we agree with the uh
 
03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
with the intention of the bill which is
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
to clarify the
 
03:51:47.110 --> 03:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh clarify the matter um which I uh
 
03:51:48.630 --> 03:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
like Marty would hesitate to
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
characterize as a spat as much as a mild
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
disagreement which we have from time to
 
03:51:56.110 --> 03:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
time um my understanding is that you're
 
03:51:57.870 --> 03:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
likely to refer this to a subcommittee
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
in which case we would like very much to
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
work on the language um we want to do
 
03:52:04.750 --> 03:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
what we can to preserve the um the in
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
addition to and notwithstanding language
 
03:52:09.309 --> 03:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
um I want to make a couple of points one
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
is I want to make it clear that today's
 
03:52:15.030 --> 03:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
discussion is about sources of revenue
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
to the state retiree health
 
03:52:22.110 --> 03:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
benefit and it is not about local reti
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
health benefits or any other
 
03:52:25.950 --> 03:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
subdivisions this is merely about the
 
03:52:28.269 --> 03:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
state plan that if you're if you're a
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
member or participant in something else
 
03:52:32.590 --> 03:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
this is not related to that or related
 
03:52:34.510 --> 03:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
to you it is merely about the revenue
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
sources for the retire Health Plan the
 
03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
largest one is a uh significant general
 
03:52:45.309 --> 03:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
fund appropriation but there are a
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
couple of other ones and we're talking
 
03:52:47.710 --> 03:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
about two of them today one is the
 
03:52:50.429 --> 03:52:50.439 align:start position:0%
medical subsidy and the other is the
 
03:52:53.309 --> 03:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
premium contribution in 2001 the medical
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
subsidy was created and for those of you
 
03:52:57.910 --> 03:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
who are as old as I am and can remember
 
03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
the 2001 budget debate you will remember
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
it was an enormously contentious time um
 
03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have much money tell
 
03:53:09.550 --> 03:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
me if you've heard that story before um
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
and as uh as part of a bunch of
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
compromises there was a medical subsidy
 
03:53:16.110 --> 03:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
created um which was about $8 million at
 
03:53:18.910 --> 03:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
that time um to the plan and it it is a
 
03:53:20.309 --> 03:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to make this point it is a
 
03:53:22.990 --> 03:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy to the plan as opposed to a
 
03:53:25.910 --> 03:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
subsidy to the individual this is a uh
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
this is a a a transfer uh we send money
 
03:53:30.750 --> 03:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system they send money
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
back and it is revenue to support uh the
 
03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
sustainability of benefits for the
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
healthc care plan um in 2009 when
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
premium contributions started being
 
03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
charged um the language and I I believe
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
we actually helped the legislature write
 
03:53:46.189 --> 03:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
the language and was probably Linda
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
hodon at the time who people will
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
remember um And to clarify that this was
 
03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
an additional source of Revenue they
 
03:53:57.750 --> 03:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
inserted into the law the phrase um the
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
retire premium would be in addition to
 
03:53:59.880 --> 03:54:01.030 align:start position:0%
retire premium would be in addition to
and

03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:54:03.510 --> 03:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding uh the medical subsidy
 
03:54:06.189 --> 03:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
that is to say that that I think that's
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
actually fairly clear language in
 
03:54:09.510 --> 03:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
addition to and notwithstanding
 
03:54:11.790 --> 03:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
our position as a department has been
 
03:54:14.309 --> 03:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
that that means that it should be in
 
03:54:15.750 --> 03:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
addition to and
 
03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding and um that's the source
 
03:54:19.870 --> 03:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
of our disagreement with the retirement
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
system where they think it should not be
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
an addition to and notwithstanding and
 
03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
we would like that language to be
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
interpreted the way it's written you
 
03:54:33.870 --> 03:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
know in the English language um but um
 
03:54:35.870 --> 03:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
in many past years this has not been a
 
03:54:37.469 --> 03:54:37.479 align:start position:0%
particular issue but we're in a position
 
03:54:39.510 --> 03:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
right now some of you will know that
 
03:54:41.149 --> 03:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
there are people who are rather than
 
03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
having their benefit deducted from their
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
um from their retirement check are being
 
03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
build for it instead um and it's uh it's
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
under a thousand people but um there's
 
03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
potential for it to grow and we agree
 
03:54:58.670 --> 03:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
with Marty that um we should approach
 
03:55:01.070 --> 03:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature and come up with that we
 
03:55:03.269 --> 03:55:03.279 align:start position:0%
have we did ask the Attorney General's
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
office um Kristen lers who's an
 
03:55:07.870 --> 03:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General to look at
 
03:55:10.910 --> 03:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
this issue um a couple years ago and to
 
03:55:12.750 --> 03:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
do a thorough review and we think the
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
legislative history is actually there
 
03:55:18.870 --> 03:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
and is fairly wholsome and um and
 
03:55:21.630 --> 03:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
reaches a fairly definitive conclusion I
 
03:55:23.550 --> 03:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
would suggest if you have a subcommittee
 
03:55:25.910 --> 03:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
look at this that um you should invite
 
03:55:27.630 --> 03:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
them to testify as well and we would be
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you on language but
 
03:55:32.229 --> 03:55:32.239 align:start position:0%
this is a matter of ensuring that the um
 
03:55:35.870 --> 03:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
State reti Health Plan has sufficient
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
revenues to support um the current
 
03:55:41.030 --> 03:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
benefit benefit level which I think is
 
03:55:42.990 --> 03:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
um a very appropriate benefit level and
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
is actually a very um wholesome plan for
 
03:55:46.600 --> 03:55:49.530 align:start position:0%

introduced last year by one of our

long-term colleagues The Honorable Mark
 
03:57:33.229 --> 03:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
PR Mark moved out of his uh old District
 
03:57:37.429 --> 03:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
during the interim and uh was not I
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
apparently was not in his new new
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
District long enough to run for the
 
03:57:45.070 --> 03:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
house again so I for one hope that uh at
 
03:57:47.670 --> 03:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
at the next election round we'll see him
 
03:57:51.630 --> 03:57:51.640 align:start position:0%
back joining us from his new location
 
03:57:55.110 --> 03:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
anyway um the bill that he introduced
 
03:57:58.590 --> 03:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
last year House Bill
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
1377 which was introduced to make a
 
03:58:06.269 --> 03:58:06.279 align:start position:0%
technical correction to a law enacted in
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
2019 and was requested by the fish and
 
03:58:11.790 --> 03:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
game department to make the

unable ble to present it this term I'm
 
03:58:43.990 --> 03:58:44.000 align:start position:0%

03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
him to attend today hoping that he might
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
be willing to testify and explain his
 
03:58:56.269 --> 03:58:56.279 align:start position:0%

03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
bill so anyone if any person does wish
 
03:59:12.030 --> 03:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
to testify please raise your hand and I
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.189 --> 03:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:28.349 --> 03:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:30.670 --> 03:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
chairman uh this is
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
um this is another
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill that ol screwed up the people on
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
but that's here no there so if for those
 
03:59:41.269 --> 03:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
that are new to the committee we looked
 
03:59:43.590 --> 03:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
at this last last
 
03:59:47.030 --> 03:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
session and one of the reasons for this
 
03:59:52.469 --> 03:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
really had to do with a
 
03:59:55.910 --> 03:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
technical mistake or Omission if you
 
03:59:55.920 --> 03:59:57.790 align:start position:0%
technical mistake or Omission if you
will

03:59:57.790 --> 03:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
um in the sense that you it was it was
 
04:00:05.469 --> 04:00:05.479 align:start position:0%
including folks you know police officers
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters Rescue Squad folks in a
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
certain area and then not necessarily in
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
the other area the other issue with this
 
04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
is if you look down at part
 
04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
two subparagraph
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
H it the the original language put a
 
04:00:25.720 --> 04:00:28.389 align:start position:0%
H it the the original language put a
restriction

04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
into the activities of a rescue squad
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
member that require them to be involved
 
04:00:39.229 --> 04:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
in a fish and game activity
 
04:00:42.870 --> 04:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
to recover a lost person that the reason
 
04:00:44.670 --> 04:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
why this legislation takes out to
 
04:00:47.550 --> 04:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
recover a lost person is because that
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
was so narrowly
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
defined um you know that it it just it
 
04:00:58.990 --> 04:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
legislation have to meet just such a
 
04:01:04.790 --> 04:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
bizarre requirement and that was you
 
04:01:05.830 --> 04:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
know that was the big thing that
 
04:01:08.349 --> 04:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
representative PR was trying to fix so
 
04:01:11.429 --> 04:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
so you know this isn't really this isn't
 
04:01:13.790 --> 04:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
inventing something
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
new it's really just a housekeeping
 
04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
measure and if you look at the language
 
04:01:22.070 --> 04:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
in part
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
C and again the the removal of of 2 that
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
part at the bottom about having to
 
04:01:30.510 --> 04:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
recover a lost person it really does put
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
this back in line with what the original
 
04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
was dare to say that the language
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
currently requires them to
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
have for a lost person rather than for
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
an injured person who location is
 
04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
now that was correct Madam chairperson
 
04:01:53.269 --> 04:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
that was that was very much discussed in
 
04:01:56.110 --> 04:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
length at the you know two years ago or
 
04:01:57.510 --> 04:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
a year and a half ago whatever when we
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
had discussed this and you know it was
 
04:02:04.510 --> 04:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
it was not a big deal then when you know
 
04:02:06.149 --> 04:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
when we when representative P had
 
04:02:07.510 --> 04:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
brought this forward it was it was
 
04:02:10.389 --> 04:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
really just a technical correction
 
04:02:12.630 --> 04:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's that's what I remember
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
about his testimony and you know just
 
04:02:17.710 --> 04:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
looking through the bill itself it's
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's really all it is it's it's not uh
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
there's really nothing more to than that
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
you are there any other people who wish
 
04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
to testify I don't see any
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
hands all right then thank you very
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
much I will close the hearing on House
 
04:02:44.670 --> 04:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.429 --> 04:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
and it looks like we have some time
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
before the next
 
04:02:48.080 --> 04:02:50.189 align:start position:0%
before the next

cheap

04:05:39.469 --> 04:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
cheap
 
04:05:41.389 --> 04:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
that didn't look good I would just
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
remind everybody in the room that the
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
the sound is on the system is not muted
 
04:05:50.349 --> 04:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
for for the committee room nobody has
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
said anything but I just wanted to say
 
04:05:52.319 --> 04:05:54.469 align:start position:0%
said anything but I just wanted to say
that

04:05:54.469 --> 04:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:57.550 --> 04:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
before anybody
 
04:06:00.510 --> 04:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
does very transparent
 
04:06:00.520 --> 04:06:03.229 align:start position:0%
does very transparent
about

04:06:03.229 --> 04:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:06:09.030 --> 04:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
Pam yes Pam yes uh is Peter um so I know
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's possible to have caucuses through
 
04:06:14.510 --> 04:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
Zoom because we did it in straford
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
County but when we had our organizing
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
meeting but you have to have a
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
technician uh who knows how to do it uh
 
04:06:23.750 --> 04:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether that would mean
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
you um I I know it would it would not
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%

04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
involved in caucuses well but somebody
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
has to be the technician that sets up
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
the caucus I'm not sure how how that
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
would be done whether I've
 
04:06:43.229 --> 04:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
been somebody's going to reach out to me
 
04:06:43.239 --> 04:06:44.070 align:start position:0%
been somebody's going to reach out to me
or

04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%

whatever but U anyway so you're not
 
04:06:49.550 --> 04:06:49.560 align:start position:0%

04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:44.910 --> 04:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
um we lost internet is what happened at
 
04:07:46.590 --> 04:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
at at know time it just happened that
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
you were at lunch so you you missed the
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
excitement but that's why people may
 
04:07:54.750 --> 04:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
have lost their uh status and we're
 
04:07:58.510 --> 04:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
happy to be back on you know on track
 
04:08:00.990 --> 04:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
sorry madam chair I'm finished with that
 
04:08:03.229 --> 04:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
quick conversation I apologize I wasn't
 
04:08:06.070 --> 04:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
trying to be difficult and I hope uh I
 
04:08:08.189 --> 04:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
didn't create a difficulty I just wanted
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure I really understood what
 
04:08:13.349 --> 04:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
was happening and I do now uh no problem
 
04:08:15.309 --> 04:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
this is our first meeting so we haven't
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
worked a lot of things out I will say
 
04:08:21.750 --> 04:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
that we are on a relatively tight
 
04:08:24.670 --> 04:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
schedule we're going to have to work Zex
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
in so I would recommend you
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
caucus as you see F the Republicans had
 
04:08:32.109 --> 04:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
a caucus last
 
04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
Thursday and Madam chair I've always
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
appreciated how efficiently and swiftly
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
you run the commit so I do I appreciate
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
that reminder thank
 
04:08:44.290 --> 04:08:44.300 align:start position:0%
you uh I approve of
 
04:08:44.300 --> 04:08:46.030 align:start position:0%
you uh I approve of
[Laughter]

04:08:46.030 --> 04:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
sing all right so resuming our executive
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
session we have a motion by
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative leus to pass House Bill
 
04:08:58.830 --> 04:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
150 is there any further
 
04:09:01.309 --> 04:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll just say that uh as was
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
said the first part of it is a technical
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
correction in the first part it includes
 
04:09:09.790 --> 04:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh emergency medical technician Rescue
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
Squad members and in the second part
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
which seems to deal with the same thing
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
just a little variation they left it out
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
for some reason and in the second one
 
04:09:22.510 --> 04:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
um you know it's if if people are part
 
04:09:27.269 --> 04:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
of a um search and rescue effort then I
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
mean that should cover it and adding to
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
recover lost person seems pointless
 
04:09:31.119 --> 04:09:32.109 align:start position:0%
recover lost person seems pointless
anyway

04:09:32.109 --> 04:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:09:34.750 --> 04:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
so I see it as a technical correction we
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
should just uh
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:40.510 align:start position:0%
should just uh
approve

04:09:40.510 --> 04:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
representa Roy I don't see a fiscal note
 
04:09:46.750 --> 04:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
on this butar would
 
04:09:46.760 --> 04:09:49.030 align:start position:0%
on this butar would
have

04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
imp maybe maybe not I if I could um I
 
04:09:58.590 --> 04:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
think on the second part you know
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that there's probably uh
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
anybody that's you know part of search
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
and rescue and then they decide wasn't
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
involved cou lost person I you know I
 
04:10:11.430 --> 04:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that there'd be any there
 
04:10:11.440 --> 04:10:13.550 align:start position:0%
don't know that there'd be any there
[Music]

04:10:13.550 --> 04:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the first part I don't know how
 
04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
they've been handling it but
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
um I think it would be pretty minimal if
 
04:10:24.030 --> 04:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
any fiscal impact but that's just my
 
04:10:24.040 --> 04:10:25.349 align:start position:0%
any fiscal impact but that's just my
guess

04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
basically yes there aren't that many
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
debt benefits issued and I would at any
 
04:10:35.510 --> 04:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
time and I would suspect that in this
 
04:10:40.030 --> 04:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
and and the only difference would be for
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
someone an an EMT a rescue squad member
 
04:10:47.950 --> 04:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
who died and had no surviving dependent
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
child I mean what you know can happen
 
04:10:52.950 --> 04:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
but it's it really cuts it down I
 
04:10:55.389 --> 04:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
think Madam chair I'll point out there
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
was no fiscal note on the original Bill
 
04:11:02.109 --> 04:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
1377 either so I think it's been
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
determined in both session years that U
 
04:11:09.070 --> 04:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
there is no major fiscal impact to be
 
04:11:09.080 --> 04:11:10.710 align:start position:0%
there is no major fiscal impact to be
considered

04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
considered
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.189 --> 04:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
God thank you sweetie
 
04:11:21.070 --> 04:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
pie I only have two bills
 
04:11:25.550 --> 04:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
Jackie yes there are two bills left so
 
04:11:28.080 --> 04:11:28.830 align:start position:0%
Jackie yes there are two bills left so
that's

04:11:28.830 --> 04:11:28.840 align:start position:0%

04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
all uh one one point I have been
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
instructed that we are not to allow
 
04:13:47.229 --> 04:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
votes by people who call
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
in without
 
04:13:52.030 --> 04:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
video it's not going to matter in this
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
case but representative Judy does not
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
appear to have
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
video um I didn't I believe
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
video

04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
video
 
04:14:11.950 --> 04:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
voice was it voice well yes I'm not
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
worried about it and in this
 
04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill certainly isn't going to matter
 
04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's 18 to Z or 17 to Z but um
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
in some cases it may make a difference
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that representative
 
04:14:30.510 --> 04:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
some I I would point out Madam chair
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
that representative Judy's voice is
 
04:14:38.910 --> 04:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
probably the most identifiable of all
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
our committee members so there's no
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
doubt that's who it is I
 
04:14:46.710 --> 04:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
agree but we don't know if there's
 
04:14:51.510 --> 04:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:55.870 --> 04:14:55.880 align:start position:0%

this rule out and I hope we can manage
 
04:15:15.550 --> 04:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%

nothing or 17 to nothing
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
it should be 17 I will discuss this
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
issue with the speaker but for now
 
04:15:43.760 --> 04:15:44.990 align:start position:0%
issue with the speaker but for now
representative

04:15:44.990 --> 04:15:45.000 align:start position:0%

Judy doesn't count so you to
change

04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.870 --> 04:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
yes I think everybody else somebody had
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
what looked like just a static
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.790 --> 04:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
Jackie everyone else seems to have video
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
I'm right here you can't see
 
04:16:08.560 --> 04:16:10.109 align:start position:0%
I'm right here you can't see
me

04:16:10.109 --> 04:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:16:14.429 --> 04:16:14.439 align:start position:0%
um no would that not make the vote 18
 
04:16:17.149 --> 04:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
nothing I thought it was 19 to nothing
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
counting him I thought it was 19 to
 
04:16:22.990 --> 04:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.070 --> 04:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
well we can see you Jackie thank you
 
04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
while everyone's Counting please accept
 
04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
my apology when I screamed thank God it
 
04:16:33.070 --> 04:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
was because my husband brought me a cup
 
04:16:36.030 --> 04:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
of coffee and I didn't realize I was
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
unmuted I
 
04:16:40.269 --> 04:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
I've been in my in my office since N9
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
please so M Madam
 
04:16:51.550 --> 04:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
chair um if you're going to get a
 
04:16:54.429 --> 04:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
clarification about what to do when the
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
person can't isn't using Zoom is only
 
04:16:59.550 --> 04:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
using the telephone could you just
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
clarify also if video means you have to
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
see our face or we're just using Zoom
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
because that's two different
 
04:17:12.189 --> 04:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
things I think it means you need to use
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
use your face and in fact I don't
 
04:17:19.469 --> 04:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
haven't seen representative saso face
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
today you we we saw him before we saw
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
him before when he was in his
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.670 --> 04:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
yeah all right I'm sorry madam chair
 
04:17:35.590 --> 04:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
guess I'm going to be that we can't see
 
04:17:37.990 --> 04:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
you at all all just for whatever it's
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
worth um I obviously you're in the L but
 
04:17:44.109 --> 04:17:44.119 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth I can't see anyone
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
who's actually in the L Edna room or
 
04:17:51.030 --> 04:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
whatever just for the record well
 
04:17:52.830 --> 04:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
actually we're down on the second floor
 
04:17:55.750 --> 04:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's not our own room but uh there are
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
in fact four other members of the
 
04:17:59.670 --> 04:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee who are here and we can all
 
04:18:00.630 --> 04:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
see each
 
04:18:04.309 --> 04:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
other great we can see you're visible I
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
can see yes that's correct you are VIs
 
04:18:10.269 --> 04:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
visble you're very tiny
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
but representative Schulz they're in the
 
04:18:17.070 --> 04:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
long shot technically
 
04:18:20.229 --> 04:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
speaking yes that's
 
04:18:22.590 --> 04:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
correct the main screen we should call
 
04:18:25.229 --> 04:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
it forward that we proceed according to
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
the rules and if the person cannot be
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
seen live it's bad enough that we're
 
04:18:33.070 --> 04:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
doing this in the fashion we forced to
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
but if a person cannot be seen
 
04:18:35.720 --> 04:18:37.309 align:start position:0%
but if a person cannot be seen
live

04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
live
 
04:18:41.550 --> 04:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
I I agree and again today I expect the
 
04:18:43.469 --> 04:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
vote on the next bill to be unanimous
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
also so I'm not going to worry about it
 
04:18:49.469 --> 04:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
but I I will get clarification before
 
04:18:51.670 --> 04:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
our next
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
Mee Madame chair this is representative
 
04:18:57.469 --> 04:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
groa if I may I would recommend that
 
04:19:00.990 --> 04:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
when taking the vote everyone who has is
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
calling from remote does have their
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
space visible so that we can at least
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
see everyone voting in
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
person and those people on the phone I
 
04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
do agree I do agree that the rules are
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
those people calling in on the phone
 
04:19:18.630 --> 04:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
visible are not allowed to vote that was
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
what I read in the um information sent
 
04:19:25.840 --> 04:19:27.109 align:start position:0%
what I read in the um information sent
to

04:19:27.109 --> 04:19:27.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:32.109 --> 04:19:32.119 align:start position:0%
us yes that was I had and I I will get a
 
04:19:34.109 --> 04:19:34.119 align:start position:0%
clarification I will see what we can do
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
about representative
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:19:37.750 align:start position:0%
about representative
Duty

04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
Duty
 
04:19:39.950 --> 04:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like to point out that hand
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
hold a representative uh Madam Madame
 
04:19:47.790 --> 04:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
chair Madam chair this J
 
04:19:53.070 --> 04:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
Judy uh in that note I see number one to
 
04:19:55.830 --> 04:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
with uh the B
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
hhvs and all
 
04:20:02.030 --> 04:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
tone for higher quality so I don't know
 
04:20:05.149 --> 04:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
why they put uh all
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
telephone I'm sorry sorry I didn't
 
04:20:10.990 --> 04:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
understand you would you repeat that no
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
I see in my in my calendar we put uh
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
number one to join the webinar
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
telephone right right but you we
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be using the calendar Zoom
 
04:20:35.710 --> 04:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
link we should be using the link that is
 
04:20:38.349 --> 04:20:38.359 align:start position:0%
sent to us in individually the calendar
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
link is for the public to to participate
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the meeting of course they don't have
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
a vote anyway um but uh but it's been
 
04:20:51.149 --> 04:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
correctly stated that the rule is quite
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
clear you know if you're on the zoom you
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
can vote if you're just calling in by
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
telephone you can't vote uh so maybe
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
some additional clarification is
 
04:21:05.070 --> 04:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
possible but that seems fairly
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
straightforward and and uh we just have
 
04:21:09.790 --> 04:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
to get you some
 
04:21:12.269 --> 04:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
technical um improvements so that you
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
can be on the zoom with the rest of us
 
04:21:15.870 --> 04:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
but you shouldn't be using the link
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's in the
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
calendar represent Schmid is exactly
 
04:21:24.109 --> 04:21:24.119 align:start position:0%
correct you you have been each of us has
 
04:21:28.510 --> 04:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
been sent twice in fact a link to the
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%

04:21:35.109 --> 04:21:35.119 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair um again it's
 
04:26:12.910 --> 04:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
Diane Shu marac 20 here to bother you
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
again uh introducing House Bill
 
04:26:19.630 --> 04:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
173 which requires the independent
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
investment Committee of the retirement
 
04:26:26.109 --> 04:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
system to report investment
 
04:26:30.630 --> 04:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
fees this bill is an attempt to add some
 
04:26:32.830 --> 04:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
transparency to the actions of the
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
independent investment Committee of the
 
04:26:35.279 --> 04:26:36.870 align:start position:0%
independent investment Committee of the
retirement

04:26:36.870 --> 04:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
system like me I'm sure many of you have
 
04:26:39.760 --> 04:26:40.910 align:start position:0%
system like me I'm sure many of you have
some

04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
Investments uh that you have on the
 
04:26:48.189 --> 04:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
outside um and it's pretty darger that
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
you get uh at least quarterly statements
 
04:26:55.590 --> 04:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
from those investment companies or from
 
04:26:59.109 --> 04:26:59.119 align:start position:0%
your financial advisor telling you what
 
04:27:01.630 --> 04:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
they've invested in and what the fees
 
04:27:04.990 --> 04:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
that they've charged to administer those
 
04:27:07.149 --> 04:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
Investments are
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh we as employees and I'm a retired
 
04:27:15.189 --> 04:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
state employee I'll state that out there
 
04:27:16.910 --> 04:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
and as
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
employers uh which the state budget uh
 
04:27:23.590 --> 04:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
pays for state employees portion of
 
04:27:26.349 --> 04:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
retirement uh I feel we should have the
 
04:27:27.590 --> 04:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
right to
 
04:27:31.630 --> 04:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
know exactly how the fees that are being
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
paid how much the fees are to what kinds
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
of Investments
 
04:27:40.630 --> 04:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
counselors or advisers are being used uh
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
right now all that we get is the lumpsum
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
figure this much has been spent and then
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
we get the returns and quite a few of us
 
04:27:54.510 --> 04:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
were quite alarmed at the returns at the
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year in June of uh
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
2020 when they came back with a return
 
04:28:01.680 --> 04:28:03.550 align:start position:0%
2020 when they came back with a return
of

04:28:03.550 --> 04:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:28:06.510 --> 04:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
1.1% uh it seemed quite
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
um low and basically abnormal compared
 
04:28:13.469 --> 04:28:13.479 align:start position:0%
to many other and many other funds that
 
04:28:15.309 --> 04:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
are out
 
04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
there so this is just an attempt as I
 
04:28:22.990 --> 04:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
said to try and have these figures be
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
made public uh I understand that Mr
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
Carlin has said that they can be posted
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
on the retirement website uh the cost
 
04:28:37.309 --> 04:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
should not be anything major it's I I
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
honestly believe that these figures are
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
probably reported to the investment
 
04:28:44.830 --> 04:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
committee and it's just a matter of
 
04:28:48.990 --> 04:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
relinquishing them to the membership and
 
04:28:49.000 --> 04:28:52.349 align:start position:0%
relinquishing them to the membership and
the

04:28:52.349 --> 04:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
questions see
 
04:29:02.349 --> 04:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
none yes I'd like to point out a couple
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
of things uh first uh the
 
04:29:08.990 --> 04:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
there is no connection between the fees
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we pay and the return that we get
 
04:29:14.349 --> 04:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not opposed to the bill but I don't
 
04:29:19.990 --> 04:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
see how knowing that the ABC manager uh
 
04:29:22.830 --> 04:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
voted this way or that way how that
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
actually will affect us the other thing
 
04:29:30.510 --> 04:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
is uh yes we Pro we may be under this
 
04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
time but nobody ever says anything when
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
it hits 14% so it's uh we we can't be
 
04:29:40.030 --> 04:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
Monday morning quarterbacks I'm voting
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:47.229 --> 04:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill I I if taking that as perhaps a
 
04:29:51.750 --> 04:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
question um I will say that I think if
 
04:29:55.550 --> 04:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
the fees that are paid to as I said
 
04:29:59.309 --> 04:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
specific uh Consultants or firms uh
 
04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
would give a better judge of the value
 
04:30:04.950 --> 04:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
of the judgments that are being made and
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
I think if
 
04:30:08.990 --> 04:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
the Judgment of one or more members or
 
04:30:11.830 --> 04:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
the entire investment committee are in
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
question that's probably the only way
 
04:30:15.550 --> 04:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
04:30:18.429 --> 04:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
tell thank you representative fellows
 
04:30:20.309 --> 04:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
you had a
 
04:30:23.910 --> 04:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair um uh
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative Shu do you know if other
 
04:30:27.199 --> 04:30:28.830 align:start position:0%
representative Shu do you know if other
state

04:30:28.830 --> 04:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:30:32.590 --> 04:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
employee retirement funds have a report
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
like that that they make
 
04:30:36.990 --> 04:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
available yes I understand that there
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
are many I don't have the exact number
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm guessing probably Mr Carlin could
 
04:30:47.429 --> 04:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
speaker see no other questions thank you
 
04:31:02.229 --> 04:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.990 --> 04:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
you recognize Marty Carlin from the
 
04:31:05.000 --> 04:31:07.269 align:start position:0%
you recognize Marty Carlin from the
retirement

04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair again for the
 
04:31:11.389 --> 04:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
record uh my name is Marty Carlin
 
04:31:11.399 --> 04:31:12.590 align:start position:0%
record uh my name is Marty Carlin
representing

04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
representing
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
nhrs um this this bill was uh put in
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
last year and made it through the house
 
04:31:20.429 --> 04:31:20.439 align:start position:0%
and died in another Omnibus Bill over
 
04:31:23.590 --> 04:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
the summer uh at that time just like now
 
04:31:25.149 --> 04:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
um you know we have no position on the
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill and believe we would be able to
 
04:31:29.670 --> 04:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
produce a quarterly report um you know
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
without any additional uh significant
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
expense um just to address a couple of
 
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the um comments made earlier just by
 
04:31:40.950 --> 04:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
way of background um I did want to say
 
04:31:43.070 --> 04:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
that um you
 
04:31:45.790 --> 04:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
know National Council on Public Employee
 
04:31:49.950 --> 04:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems NC Pur does a survey
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
of participants on investment fees and
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
our our fees were lower than the
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
national average by a fairly significant
 
04:31:58.710 --> 04:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
margin in the last survey as a
 
04:32:00.750 --> 04:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of assets it was 30 basis
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
points or. 3% of assets and the national
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
average was 48 BAS
 
04:32:10.510 --> 04:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
points um additionally um we do um in
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
with new manager agreements we have what
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
we refer to as a most favored nation
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
clause uh in investment agreements which
 
04:32:19.710 --> 04:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
says that if another comparable public
 
04:32:21.550 --> 04:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
plan invests at the fund with a lower
 
04:32:23.950 --> 04:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
fee structure and that we currently have
 
04:32:27.149 --> 04:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
our fees will be um adjusted downward so
 
04:32:29.229 --> 04:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to reassure that the
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh this committee Edna that
 
04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
the investment committee does all its
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
can all it C all it can do to try to
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
manage fees and keep them uh at a
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable level um in terms of
 
04:32:45.109 --> 04:32:45.119 align:start position:0%
transparency just if if you're not aware
 
04:32:46.510 --> 04:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh the investment committee does meet
 
04:32:48.630 --> 04:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
monthly and and those meetings are open
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the public uh they seldom if ever go
 
04:32:55.309 --> 04:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
into non-public session um so folks can
 
04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
can observe uh if they would like and uh
 
04:33:00.790 --> 04:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
since last year another member has been
 
04:33:02.830 --> 04:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
added to the investment committee by
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
Statute a an existing Public Employee
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
member a Portsmouth fire captain so
 
04:33:09.551 --> 04:33:09.561 align:start position:0%
there's uh someone from the membership
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
who's you know involved in the committee
 
04:33:14.029 --> 04:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
and and following all this um with that
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
again we have no position or or concern
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
with the bill so I'll yeld the floor and
 
04:33:20.830 --> 04:33:20.840 align:start position:0%

member uh was put in as a nonvoting
 
04:33:41.629 --> 04:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
member that that's correct the
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislation added um the the member is a
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
non- voting member although um he still
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
is you know full contributor and asks
 
04:33:51.150 --> 04:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
questions and sees all the same material
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's it with with that addition it's a
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
six- member committee there's five
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%

the question question that I asked
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative she would about do other
 
04:34:12.349 --> 04:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
states um produce a similar report in
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
for their Retirement Systems um you know
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
what you're going to see uh n nationally
 
04:34:20.750 --> 04:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
is probably a hodg Podge I'm I'm sure
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
some do um and and some some may not um
 
04:34:27.789 --> 04:34:27.799 align:start position:0%
that's one thing with investment fees
 
04:34:29.709 --> 04:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
that actually the the gby governmental
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
governmental Accounting Standards Board
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
is looking at in terms of uh
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
establishing National
 
04:34:38.429 --> 04:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
standards on fee reporting they kicked
 
04:34:40.709 --> 04:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
off a gasby project on that last year
 
04:34:42.510 --> 04:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
and they're looking into sort of
 
04:34:44.590 --> 04:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
standardizing that and to get a clean
 
04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
audit opinion you need to um follow the
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
gasby standards so whatever they come
 
04:34:50.910 --> 04:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
out with you know if if it's not what
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
we're already doing we would adjust
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
accordingly but you know there's it
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
varies quite a bit from state to state I
 
04:34:59.709 --> 04:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
I I can't point to any state that has a
 
04:35:01.990 --> 04:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know a goal standard you know report
 
04:35:03.789 --> 04:35:03.799 align:start position:0%
um type of thing but but different
 
04:35:07.551 --> 04:35:07.561 align:start position:0%
levels of disclosure know around the
 
04:35:10.189 --> 04:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
country so that after this bill is
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
implemented New Hampshire will be the
 
04:35:11.760 --> 04:35:15.269 align:start position:0%
implemented New Hampshire will be the
cold

04:35:15.269 --> 04:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.551 --> 04:35:18.561 align:start position:0%
standard depends on who's weighing the
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
gold all right any other
 
04:35:24.269 --> 04:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
questions all
 
04:35:27.029 --> 04:35:27.039 align:start position:0%
right Richard
 
04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
gulla uh can everyone hear me yes great
 
04:35:33.990 --> 04:35:34.000 align:start position:0%

name is Richard gulla I am am president
 
04:35:38.029 --> 04:35:38.039 align:start position:0%
of the state employees Association SEIU
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
Local 1984 uh represent nearly 10,000
 
04:35:42.629 --> 04:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
employees here at the State of New
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire County Municipal uh I'll be
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
brief um House Bill 173 is asking for
 
04:35:51.390 --> 04:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
not only the disclosure of the amounts
 
04:35:54.789 --> 04:35:54.799 align:start position:0%
of the investment fees but is also a
 
04:35:57.510 --> 04:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
transcription of the fees this brings
 
04:35:59.590 --> 04:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
further transparency and accountability
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
to the investment process this will help
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
provide an opportunity for the members
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
both active and tired of the system as
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
well as the public at large to ensure
 
04:36:11.629 --> 04:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
that the fees being paid to invest A9
 
04:36:14.310 --> 04:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
billion Public Employee Retirement plan
 
04:36:17.349 --> 04:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
are being spent wisely like many other
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
factors investment fees are an important
 
04:36:21.429 --> 04:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
piece of keeping the retirement solvent
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
and stable uh we are concerned with
 
04:36:27.629 --> 04:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
seeing only a 1.1% return for fiscal
 
04:36:30.670 --> 04:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
year 2020 um where many other states
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
outperform New Hampshire
 
04:36:35.949 --> 04:36:35.959 align:start position:0%
significantly um
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 173 will allow for
 
04:36:40.590 --> 04:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability in the
 
04:36:43.390 --> 04:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
investment process to ensure that the
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
funds used to provide benefits are being
 
04:36:48.750 --> 04:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
protected and also being done in a
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
prudent manner manner to provide stable
 
04:36:54.349 --> 04:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
and predictable rates for our employees
 
04:36:57.310 --> 04:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
and retirees and uh with that I will
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:04.000 --> 04:37:08.349 align:start position:0%

04:37:19.150 --> 04:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.160 --> 04:37:25.189 align:start position:0%

04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%

04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
second you wish to speak to your your
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:25.110 --> 04:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you uh I had moved off
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
the pass on this I believe that this
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislation is um is keeping in line
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
with with the um sentiment in the idea
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
of line of duty deaths I believe that
 
04:44:40.270 --> 04:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
there was ample
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that given the new awareness
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
of PTSD and the effect on emergency
 
04:44:48.190 --> 04:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
workers that this should um definitely
 
04:44:48.200 --> 04:44:52.070 align:start position:0%
workers that this should um definitely
be

04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:52.080 --> 04:44:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
considered

04:44:54.910 --> 04:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
considered
 
04:44:56.990 --> 04:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
covered like I said I think we all heard
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony I
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.280 --> 04:45:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
move

04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
move
 
04:45:08.030 --> 04:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
pres Schmid you to say
 
04:45:10.948 --> 04:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
something I do Madam
 
04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
chair let me just get myself
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
up so uh I think we heard the same test
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
last time and approved the bill one
 
04:45:23.390 --> 04:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
thing that was new this time was the
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
statement that research shows that um
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
that such a provision does not in fact
 
04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh lead uh to SU suicide
 
04:45:40.230 --> 04:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
ideation um and we recognize of course
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh not too many people are going to kill
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
themselves for others benefit but the
 
04:45:48.750 --> 04:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
benefit is for the family and the
 
04:45:52.788 --> 04:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
survivors um and I I fully support the
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
idea that uh we need to do something
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
about this uh and for the for our First
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
Responders who are under tremendous
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
stress in their chosen profession so
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
I'll happily
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
well second yes okay sorry
 
04:46:16.350 --> 04:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
I'm is there any other representative Al
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
yes um I'm concerned that this bill
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
changes the mean meaning of the words in
 
04:46:21.708 --> 04:46:21.718 align:start position:0%
the line of
 
04:46:25.310 --> 04:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
duty um and not withstanding the
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that we've heard that
 
04:46:30.910 --> 04:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
suggested that $100,000 is not an
 
04:46:30.920 --> 04:46:33.190 align:start position:0%
suggested that $100,000 is not an
inducement

04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
inducement
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
um $100,000 is a chunk of
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
change and as I heard it said to me
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
recently um
 
04:46:46.628 --> 04:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
just you know by way of example you have
 
04:46:50.548 --> 04:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
a uh a police officer who is stressed on
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
the job stressed financially stressed
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
for personal
 
04:46:55.990 --> 04:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
reasons and he's looking at the
 
04:46:58.990 --> 04:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of gaining $100,000 for his
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
family um I'm concerned that it it
 
04:47:06.030 --> 04:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
brings into effect the Geor valy uh path
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
which is I'm worth more dead than alive
 
04:47:12.110 --> 04:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
to my family also uh again not
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
withstanding the testimony that we heard
 
04:47:16.548 --> 04:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
which I do not believe is supported by
 
04:47:20.548 --> 04:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
um any evidence the bill is a reward for
 
04:47:22.990 --> 04:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
and an inducement to commit suicide it's
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
a step towards the acceptance and
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
normalization of
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
suicide um rather than to support those
 
04:47:33.548 --> 04:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
who are considering suicide so I cannot
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:44.590 --> 04:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't have all that much
 
04:47:48.030 --> 04:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
history but when there's been an
 
04:47:49.868 --> 04:47:49.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunate event with the state
 
04:47:53.948 --> 04:47:53.958 align:start position:0%
employee not covered there have been I
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm wrong on this specific
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
bills brought in to help the Widow help
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
the family
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:48:07.788 --> 04:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
I think that would probably happen in
 
04:48:11.548 --> 04:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
such a circumstance and I would prefer
 
04:48:15.670 --> 04:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
to see it as policy rather than somebody
 
04:48:19.270 --> 04:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
coming uh to the legislature
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
for an unfortunate event this is a tough
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
one I don't think we're
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
gonna I guess your principle is right
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
but it's just not going to be a lot of
 
04:48:29.760 --> 04:48:32.990 align:start position:0%
but it's just not going to be a lot of
this

04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
so I I'll vote
 
04:48:36.480 --> 04:48:40.670 align:start position:0%
so I I'll vote
for

04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:43.548 --> 04:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam

and coming from a personal experience I
 
04:49:02.830 --> 04:49:02.840 align:start position:0%

uh my last day working me just a fire I
 
04:49:09.948 --> 04:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
spent at a funeral for a coworker who
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
had committed
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
suicide uh who worked with me at
 
04:49:15.990 --> 04:49:16.000 align:start position:0%

04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh eled on this benefit unfortunately
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're a year too late for them but I
 
04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to see it happen to anyone
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:37.030 --> 04:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
this um thank you madam chair um my
 
04:49:39.430 --> 04:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
concern is not with the concept that
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm fine with that it I'm just
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
concerned with that sentence that was a
 
04:49:47.830 --> 04:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee addition to this bill last
 
04:49:50.070 --> 04:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
time around the one that says death by
 
04:49:52.640 --> 04:49:52.650 align:start position:0%
Suicide should be considered a work
 
04:49:52.650 --> 04:49:53.830 align:start position:0%
Suicide should be considered a work

04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
related cause of death and it it just
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
seems to me that in many cases it is but
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
it it might not always be um it could be
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
that the the person you know just had
 
04:50:11.350 --> 04:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
some you know personal issues or home
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
issues you know somebody who just uh was
 
04:50:17.150 --> 04:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
sered divorce papers or something like
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
that so that the cause could be
 
04:50:22.110 --> 04:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
something that's not work rated and my
 
04:50:25.548 --> 04:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
recollection which is fuzzy is that last
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
year there was somebody
 
04:50:31.910 --> 04:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
testified that that that wouldn't
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
be that that that that would not cause
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
this benefit
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
to um be delivered if it was clearly not
 
04:50:40.680 --> 04:50:41.670 align:start position:0%
to um be delivered if it was clearly not
a

04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:50:44.430 --> 04:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
work-related uh event that caused the
 
04:50:49.310 --> 04:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
suicide but I I'm not nobody testified
 
04:50:52.030 --> 04:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
to that this time and so that leaves me
 
04:50:54.910 --> 04:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
up in the air you know I except I like
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
the concept I'm just concerned about the
 
04:51:00.548 --> 04:51:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
sentence you representative O'Brien
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I would just
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
like to say that uh I am going to
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
support this uh and I want you all if I
 
04:51:15.070 --> 04:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
may share with you I think we're just
 
04:51:17.670 --> 04:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
really uh scratching the tip of the
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
iceberg on this this is been a long time
 
04:51:24.390 --> 04:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
to come to address this particular issue
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh you got to keep in mind uh like you
 
04:51:29.670 --> 04:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
say something that may not be related to
 
04:51:32.190 --> 04:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
the job but everything is
 
04:51:34.910 --> 04:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
cumulative uh there are our events you
 
04:51:37.628 --> 04:51:37.638 align:start position:0%
paid me as a firefighter I held the rank
 
04:51:39.990 --> 04:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
of deputy chief for the city of nashille
 
04:51:44.350 --> 04:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
for 15 years I've worked many many times
 
04:51:47.948 --> 04:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
uh suggested many many times to some of
 
04:51:52.510 --> 04:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
my uh uh co-workers uh that they go into
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
EAP you don't know what they deal with
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
uh you may say oh something's going
 
04:52:01.110 --> 04:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
wrong with the marriage but many times I
 
04:52:03.350 --> 04:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
have seen some of the problems within
 
04:52:05.470 --> 04:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
the marriage has been dragged home from
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
the fir house it is an occupation where
 
04:52:13.470 --> 04:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
you pay us to man that wall and we do it
 
04:52:16.030 --> 04:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
so you can sit home in your armchairs
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
and the key is this we see things that
 
04:52:22.030 --> 04:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
you should not see it's terrible enough
 
04:52:25.310 --> 04:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
that we see them and for a culture of
 
04:52:27.390 --> 04:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
the fire department I'm sure with the
 
04:52:30.548 --> 04:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
police uh there's been many many years
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
where the answer was going out with your
 
04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
buddies and the answer is in the bottom
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
of the bottle thank God that has changed
 
04:52:42.150 --> 04:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
and now with the highlight and with uh
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
Progressive uh legislation such as this
 
04:52:48.390 --> 04:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
this has got to go a long way again it's
 
04:52:50.990 --> 04:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
scratching the tip of the iceberg but it
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
is a reality uh every firefighter knows
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
another firefighter who has committed
 
04:53:01.470 --> 04:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
suicide many firefighter knows another
 
04:53:04.590 --> 04:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
firefighter that is said what if if I
 
04:53:06.670 --> 04:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
reached out another two feet could I
 
04:53:09.230 --> 04:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
grab that kid I'm not trying to be
 
04:53:11.788 --> 04:53:11.798 align:start position:0%
melodramatic but every firefighter does
 
04:53:14.190 --> 04:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
know what do you think the victims of a
 
04:53:16.548 --> 04:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
car accident when they hit a tree they
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
remain quiet they're not screaming
 
04:53:21.150 --> 04:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
they're not calling for Mama and trying
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
to get you out of while you're trying to
 
04:53:25.628 --> 04:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
extricate them these are horrific things
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
and and it again you got to keep in mind
 
04:53:32.070 --> 04:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's cumulative it adds up and uh so
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
therefore something like this will do
 
04:53:37.708 --> 04:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
have happen but this is not the Panacea
 
04:53:39.830 --> 04:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
we got to try to stop it on the other
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
end from occurring but recognizing when
 
04:53:46.030 --> 04:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
a suicide does occur we are sympathetic
 
04:53:49.590 --> 04:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
to come up with the benefits thank you
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Schulz you
 
04:53:55.070 --> 04:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
have two minutes and then we will
 
04:53:57.310 --> 04:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
adjourn the executive session thank you
 
04:54:00.788 --> 04:54:00.798 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I'm tempted to talk about
 
04:54:03.948 --> 04:54:03.958 align:start position:0%
how offended I am by a previous uh
 
04:54:06.910 --> 04:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues remarks but I'll just Express
 
04:54:10.150 --> 04:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
gratitude to those of you who have uh
 
04:54:12.910 --> 04:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
seemed to get that the brain is an organ
 
04:54:15.708 --> 04:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
in the body and that the stigma around
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
mental illness must stop especially when
 
04:54:20.548 --> 04:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of research that the
 
04:54:24.708 --> 04:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
folks who are put in extreme extremely
 
04:54:27.910 --> 04:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
stressful and traumatic uh
 
04:54:32.910 --> 04:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
jobs uh serving for us um that they
 
04:54:36.070 --> 04:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
would have have uh repercussions from
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
that in their brain and their body is
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
not a shock we have plenty of research
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
to show that and I just want to say I'm
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud that the majority of us
 
04:54:51.230 --> 04:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
seem to get that uh it's time to end the
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:00.270 --> 04:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
illness thank you uh thank you thank you
 
04:55:00.280 --> 04:55:02.390 align:start position:0%
illness thank you uh thank you thank you
for

04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:55:02.400 --> 04:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
for
being

04:55:04.760 --> 04:55:04.770 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:55:04.770 --> 04:55:05.948 align:start position:0%
being

04:55:05.948 --> 04:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:55:07.788 --> 04:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to address representative
 
04:55:10.150 --> 04:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
fellow's question real quick if you look
 
04:55:14.708 --> 04:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
at line F on um on the bill it talks
 
04:55:16.350 --> 04:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
about because you were concerned about
 
04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
what's considered a duty cause of death
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
it it specifically says his or her
 
04:55:24.390 --> 04:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
duties as a result of an incident
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
accident or violence causing death or
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
injuries which are direct or approximate
 
04:55:31.990 --> 04:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
cause of death so in order to award the
 
04:55:34.628 --> 04:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
benefits you know there'd have to be
 
04:55:37.390 --> 04:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
some kind of tieback to the job so as
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
far as you know someone can make suicide
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with their job
 
04:55:42.350 --> 04:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
there would be an investigation before
 
04:55:45.548 --> 04:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.510 --> 04:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
important okay thank you uh we're
 
04:55:51.788 --> 04:55:51.798 align:start position:0%
obviously not ready to vote so I will
 
04:55:54.390 --> 04:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
adjourn the executive session to be
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
and open the public hearing on House
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:09.230 --> 04:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien you're the prime
 
04:56:15.510 --> 04:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
it thank you uh Madam
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
chair uh I good to see everybody back on
 
04:56:24.910 --> 04:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
the committee and uh I would like to
 
04:56:27.070 --> 04:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
04:56:33.070 --> 04:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
390 this is another attempt of mine and
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
where with encouragement from my
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
municipality but this is not really just
 
04:56:43.548 --> 04:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
to help the nation taxpayers it is the
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
hope that we can help all of the
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state to step back and
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
remember the conversations that we
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
shared on House Bill
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
274 we have stated that there was a
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
problem when the state went from the 3
 
04:57:03.360 --> 04:57:04.788 align:start position:0%
problem when the state went from the 3
5%

04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
5%
 
04:57:07.150 --> 04:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
contributions down to
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
nothing well what had happened in the
 
04:57:12.110 --> 04:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
meantime since
 
04:57:15.390 --> 04:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire State retirement
 
04:57:18.750 --> 04:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
system came up and wanted to get rid of
 
04:57:22.230 --> 04:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
all the unfunded
 
04:57:22.240 --> 04:57:23.830 align:start position:0%
all the unfunded
liability

04:57:23.830 --> 04:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
liability
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
now they came up and if you remember
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat and Mr Colin will probably
 
04:57:32.708 --> 04:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I did maybe
 
04:57:33.750 --> 04:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
get the
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
impression that they came up with
 
04:57:38.110 --> 04:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
something like 30 years they could have
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
probably came up with 50 years but what
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
I do know in people that probably go out
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
at home and they go out and they get
 
04:57:51.270 --> 04:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
like a 15-year morgage on their house
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
and then to come find out that some uh
 
04:57:57.310 --> 04:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
personal tragedies or some other more
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
pressing Financial
 
04:58:02.788 --> 04:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
Obligations uh do come up people
 
04:58:05.948 --> 04:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes do go up and they renegotiate
 
04:58:05.958 --> 04:58:06.750 align:start position:0%
sometimes do go up and they renegotiate
the

04:58:06.750 --> 04:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
loans now you can say that's kicking the
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
can down the
 
04:58:15.150 --> 04:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
road maybe this is kicking the can down
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
the road but what the problem is the
 
04:58:21.070 --> 04:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
current state of payment that
 
04:58:24.190 --> 04:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities have to pay right now is
 
04:58:27.510 --> 04:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
hurting them right now we have covid
 
04:58:29.548 --> 04:58:29.558 align:start position:0%
CO's not going away probably for the
 
04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
next couple years a lot of money has
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
been invested Ed into the individual
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
communities uh communities in the
 
04:58:40.510 --> 04:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
example such as nashwa has gone out of
 
04:58:42.750 --> 04:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
its way to try to help our our
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
businesses similar to Manchester and I
 
04:58:47.830 --> 04:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
think Manchester got the idea from us
 
04:58:49.628 --> 04:58:49.638 align:start position:0%
but I'll just be proud of my
 
04:58:52.990 --> 04:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
municipality but the thing is uh of
 
04:58:56.350 --> 04:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
having outside dining well Nash has lost
 
04:58:58.470 --> 04:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
some of the parking revenue from some of
 
04:59:01.350 --> 04:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
that but all these little chinks in the
 
04:59:05.350 --> 04:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
armas is coming up and trying to get to
 
04:59:07.110 --> 04:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
the uh take care of the unfunded
 
04:59:09.990 --> 04:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
liability now if you remember in part of
 
04:59:11.788 --> 04:59:11.798 align:start position:0%
the presentation that the New Hampshire
 
04:59:14.708 --> 04:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
retirement system did give us there is
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
no guarantee in 2039 that all unfunded
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
liabilities will be paid
 
04:59:24.628 --> 04:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
for so it is the hope of considering
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
this that
 
04:59:29.708 --> 04:59:29.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities may be able to make the
 
04:59:34.070 --> 04:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
choice to whether to pay this up front
 
04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
let's say like
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
payment or maybe to ask to renegotiate
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
to which this bill would be doing and
 
04:59:45.070 --> 04:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
coming up extenda extenuating it an
 
04:59:48.310 --> 04:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
additional four years uh to uh five
 
04:59:50.670 --> 04:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
years excuse me to
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
2044 now yes will it be expensive
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities will probably pay more in
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
the uh interest in doing this but will
 
05:00:03.948 --> 05:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
it get them out of the immediate trouble
 
05:00:07.948 --> 05:00:07.958 align:start position:0%
right now and it's something to consider
 
05:00:10.150 --> 05:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
between this
 
05:00:12.190 --> 05:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
05:00:15.310 --> 05:00:15.320 align:start position:0%
390 and if I may briefly Madam chair
 
05:00:18.110 --> 05:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
with Indulgence I mentioned 274
 
05:00:20.910 --> 05:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
again one of these got to go through to
 
05:00:24.750 --> 05:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
help about our cities and towns deal
 
05:00:27.788 --> 05:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
with the pension costs uh like the
 
05:00:29.788 --> 05:00:29.798 align:start position:0%
national mayor has
 
05:00:33.910 --> 05:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
stated uh all you need is $2 million
 
05:00:36.350 --> 05:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
to raise the tax rate
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
1% and uh that has already happened in
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester it has happened in as and
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's happened in each and every single
 
05:00:49.150 --> 05:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
one of your communities if you have
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
teachers firefighters police officers
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
that are in the nhrs pension system so
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'm not going to get too
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
deep into the weeds again we do have the
 
05:01:07.390 --> 05:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
mayor of the city of nashal I hope is on
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
that could come up and speak and through
 
05:01:11.670 --> 05:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
your Indulgence at the end because he
 
05:01:15.150 --> 05:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
did not sound uh sign up but also
 
05:01:18.030 --> 05:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
willing to wanting to speak will be John
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
Griffin CFO of uh the city of Nash so uh
 
05:01:28.270 --> 05:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
Madame chair I can conclude my opening
 
05:01:30.390 --> 05:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
remarks thank you are there questions
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:01:31.840 --> 05:01:35.110 align:start position:0%
from the
committee

05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you madam
 
05:01:43.628 --> 05:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:46.990 --> 05:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
Carlin thank you Madame chair um uh
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
executive director George Legos will be
 
05:01:51.310 --> 05:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
joining me we're going to co- testify if
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
U if possible he also signed up um for
 
05:01:56.350 --> 05:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
to to testify and you can while you're
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
letting him and I can get started um we
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
did provide a handout um on HB 390 uh
 
05:02:05.190 --> 05:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
through Pam to the committee I'm not
 
05:02:06.788 --> 05:02:06.798 align:start position:0%
going to read the entire handout but I
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
do have some um comments to make before
 
05:02:11.470 --> 05:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
turning it over to George and then both
 
05:02:14.110 --> 05:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
of us would be glad to um collaborate to
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have about
 
05:02:20.110 --> 05:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
um any of our testimony um as as stated
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh 390 would extend the
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
amortization period of the unfunded
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
liability as of June 30th of 2017 which
 
05:02:30.110 --> 05:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
is about five billion of the six six
 
05:02:32.350 --> 05:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
billion total liability uh from its
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
current 30-year period ending in 2039
 
05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
for another five years through
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
2044 um at its um January 12th 2021
 
05:02:46.910 --> 05:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
meeting our Board of Trustees voted 110
 
05:02:49.230 --> 05:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill as counter to the
 
05:02:52.190 --> 05:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
board's fiduciary duty of prudence and
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
requirement to adhere to sound Actuarial
 
05:02:57.948 --> 05:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
practice uh the opposition is similar uh
 
05:03:01.030 --> 05:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
to uh a 2017 bill which representative
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
O'Brien referred to which would have
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
extended the amortization uh by 10 years
 
05:03:08.430 --> 05:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
um that bill was ultimately voted in
 
05:03:11.788 --> 05:03:11.798 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate um by the house
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
now this is not to say that nhrs doesn't
 
05:03:15.788 --> 05:03:15.798 align:start position:0%
truly understand and sympathize with the
 
05:03:17.590 --> 05:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
challenges our participating employers
 
05:03:19.948 --> 05:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
are currently facing and any and all
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
efforts they are making to reduce the
 
05:03:25.708 --> 05:03:25.718 align:start position:0%
local uh tax burden uh however um there
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
is very limited discretion in setting
 
05:03:30.310 --> 05:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rates the state
 
05:03:32.390 --> 05:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
constitution state law and as as
 
05:03:35.070 --> 05:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned mention by U another person
 
05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
who spoke this morning fiduciary duty
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
required the board to um use sound actal
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
standards and setting employer
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
contribution rates necessary to keep the
 
05:03:48.230 --> 05:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
retirement system on track now among the
 
05:03:50.350 --> 05:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
factors that the board considered uh in
 
05:03:52.708 --> 05:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
its decision to oppose this bill which
 
05:03:54.990 --> 05:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
is fairly rare you tend to hear me say
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
we have no position on anything um but
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
the board does uh when it gets to a
 
05:04:02.350 --> 05:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
fiduciary level occasionally take a
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
position on a bill uh among the concerns
 
05:04:08.830 --> 05:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
were that HB 390 defers a significant
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
portion of the unfunded liability
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
payment into the 2040s increasing the
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
ultimate cost that employers will pay um
 
05:04:19.628 --> 05:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
by approximately 1.4 billion um another
 
05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
way to look at that is for every dollar
 
05:04:25.230 --> 05:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
that is not paid between next year and
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
2039 uh the communities will be paying
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
$2 back um between 2040 and
 
05:04:33.150 --> 05:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
2044 um
 
05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
and as again alluded to uh prior um you
 
05:04:38.548 --> 05:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
know some some issues back in the 90s
 
05:04:41.310 --> 05:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
and it was actually exactly 30 years ago
 
05:04:43.868 --> 05:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
back in 1991 uh when there was going to
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
be a significant percentage increase uh
 
05:04:49.470 --> 05:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
to the 1992 93 employer contribution
 
05:04:51.868 --> 05:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
rates the rates were much lower than but
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of a percentage increase that
 
05:04:55.830 --> 05:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
that increase was going to be actually
 
05:05:00.190 --> 05:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
higher than the 20% we've seen in
 
05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
2022 um and legislation um you know this
 
05:05:06.830 --> 05:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
this was occurring in a recession uh
 
05:05:09.150 --> 05:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
there was a a real estate bubble that
 
05:05:10.990 --> 05:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
had burst and there was banking crisis
 
05:05:13.350 --> 05:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
in the state um you know and there were
 
05:05:15.430 --> 05:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of pressures on local communities
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of cost so legislation was
 
05:05:20.150 --> 05:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
introduced that was pitched as a
 
05:05:22.270 --> 05:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
temporary attempt to mitigate the
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
employer contribution increase by
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
changing the Actuarial method by which
 
05:05:29.868 --> 05:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
our funding was calculated that's not
 
05:05:31.708 --> 05:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it's it IT addresses
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
it in a different way um but the
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
temporary solution that was adopted by
 
05:05:38.350 --> 05:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature back in
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
1991 remained in the law until 2007 uh
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it contributed significantly to the
 
05:05:46.150 --> 05:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
current unfunded pension liability
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
essentially the folks taxpayers myself
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
included um are paying for decisions
 
05:05:54.990 --> 05:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
made 30 years ago now
 
05:05:58.990 --> 05:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
um and so to repeat um you know that
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
attempt is is going to lead to a similar
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
con conversation in this chamber uh back
 
05:06:07.190 --> 05:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
in 2040 or
 
05:06:10.510 --> 05:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
2039 um additionally uh you know the
 
05:06:12.628 --> 05:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
board felt that HB 390 would set a
 
05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous precedent uh to create a
 
05:06:16.990 --> 05:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
template to refinance pension
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
obligations at the expensive future
 
05:06:23.350 --> 05:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
Generations um back in 2007 the
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislature with input from actuaries
 
05:06:28.350 --> 05:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
adopted the 30-year amortization plan
 
05:06:31.548 --> 05:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
that commenced in 2010 30 years was the
 
05:06:34.110 --> 05:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
uh maximum amount allowed under gasby
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
standards at the time um it gby has
 
05:06:39.628 --> 05:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
gotten out of the standard business on
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
that but um other Accounting Standards
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
folks refer to a 15 or 20 year
 
05:06:47.390 --> 05:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
amortization is more ideal but that was
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
that was what the legislature adopted um
 
05:06:51.788 --> 05:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
you know this proposal would constitute
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
a deviation from that plan and a step
 
05:06:55.830 --> 05:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
backward in terms of the progress we've
 
05:06:59.070 --> 05:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
made um since recognizing the liability
 
05:07:01.470 --> 05:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned in our presentation to
 
05:07:03.590 --> 05:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
the committee earlier month um we've
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
made positive progress in in um
 
05:07:07.548 --> 05:07:07.558 align:start position:0%
improving the funded status over the
 
05:07:09.670 --> 05:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
past decade while many other plans were
 
05:07:12.030 --> 05:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
moving in the opposite direction uh and
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is that we have a
 
05:07:16.230 --> 05:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
funding plan and we're sticking to it um
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to defer to George Legos for
 
05:07:22.470 --> 05:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
some additional comments after which um
 
05:07:26.510 --> 05:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:30.670 --> 05:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
questions Loos you recogniz okay I'm I'm
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
on with you
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um thank you madam chair
 
05:07:39.350 --> 05:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
um well um between our bill brief and
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
Marty's testimony Marty's covered it
 
05:07:42.990 --> 05:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
quite well I think he's given you the
 
05:07:45.430 --> 05:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
landscape um and I just want to
 
05:07:46.868 --> 05:07:46.878 align:start position:0%
reiterate a couple things without
 
05:07:48.548 --> 05:07:48.558 align:start position:0%
repeating everything he said first is we
 
05:07:50.190 --> 05:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
certainly do appreciate the pressure
 
05:07:52.830 --> 05:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's put on um local and school
 
05:07:55.510 --> 05:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
budgets and we understand the concerns
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
that have been expressed um one
 
05:07:59.590 --> 05:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
fundamental thing I just want to say
 
05:08:01.708 --> 05:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
about the public pension plan is that
 
05:08:03.470 --> 05:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know one of the underlying concepts
 
05:08:05.948 --> 05:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
of how this best works is when the
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
liabilities that are created with
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's employment for his future
 
05:08:13.628 --> 05:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
pension or his or her future pension are
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
are realized um the idea is that they
 
05:08:18.110 --> 05:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
should be paid for as we go along and
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's when the plan works ideally well
 
05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
in other words if you do that
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
successfully every year you never have
 
05:08:26.590 --> 05:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
an unfunded liability and we'd be paying
 
05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
the normal cost now and we wouldn't be
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
having um 80% of the employer
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
contribution going to to the unfunded
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
liability however that's the position
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
we're in as as we all know um and that's
 
05:08:40.590 --> 05:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
the as a result of not paying the
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
liabilities as they acred and pushing
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
them out into the future in order to
 
05:08:47.548 --> 05:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
solve an immediate problem and
 
05:08:50.670 --> 05:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not that far apart
 
05:08:52.190 --> 05:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
from where we are right now today
 
05:08:54.750 --> 05:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
talking about similar things um and that
 
05:08:56.350 --> 05:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
and that can be very dangerous because
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
you are pushing the liability out into
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
the future and it's a precedent you
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to follow I think the legis
 
05:09:05.430 --> 05:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
has done an excellent job uh since the
 
05:09:08.030 --> 05:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
recognition of these liabilities about
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
30 years ago when they created the
 
05:09:12.788 --> 05:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
30-year amortization schedule and made
 
05:09:14.470 --> 05:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
some other reforms to address these
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
issues and since that time the
 
05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
legislature has also been very good
 
05:09:22.548 --> 05:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
about being consistent and diligent and
 
05:09:26.190 --> 05:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
sticking with the plan and um members of
 
05:09:27.708 --> 05:09:27.718 align:start position:0%
the committee that's really the message
 
05:09:30.910 --> 05:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
I want to reinforce here um you know I
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
I've I've appeared before the committee
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
on very rare occasions because uh it's
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
not often that the board takes a
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
position and and it and Marty typically
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
deals with things dayto day but um this
 
05:09:45.190 --> 05:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
situation is one where there is concern
 
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the president that's you know that's
 
05:09:49.628 --> 05:09:49.638 align:start position:0%
how we got in the position we're in and
 
05:09:51.868 --> 05:09:51.878 align:start position:0%
perpetuating that is a very dangerous
 
05:09:55.750 --> 05:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
thing I think uh for for not only the
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
current plan but the plan as it will be
 
05:10:02.230 --> 05:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
20 or 30 years from now so what's really
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh not what's most important with the
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
pension plan is is not so much where you
 
05:10:07.788 --> 05:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
are because our funded status isn't
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
terrific it's
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
61% and but it has increased gradually
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
um over the past 10 years even though
 
05:10:16.548 --> 05:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
we've changed assumptions a couple of
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
times which increase the liabilities um
 
05:10:21.990 --> 05:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
and also have an impact on the funded
 
05:10:23.510 --> 05:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
ratio but nonetheless we've made some
 
05:10:25.910 --> 05:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
good progress so what's more important
 
05:10:27.868 --> 05:10:27.878 align:start position:0%
than where you are is where you're going
 
05:10:29.230 --> 05:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
and where we're going because of the
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
plan we have is that the original
 
05:10:33.350 --> 05:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability that was advertised
 
05:10:35.708 --> 05:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
for 30 years should in fact be paid off
 
05:10:35.718 --> 05:10:36.390 align:start position:0%
for 30 years should in fact be paid off
in

05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:10:39.230 --> 05:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
2039 um that's the way it's structured
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
um future liabilities or or gains that
 
05:10:44.510 --> 05:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
happen between now and 2039 are going to
 
05:10:46.070 --> 05:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
be separately amortized and I don't want
 
05:10:48.270 --> 05:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
to get down into the the Weeds on that
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
but that there are two different
 
05:10:52.990 --> 05:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
amortizations going on um so getting
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
back to the point of um where you're
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
going is the most important thing where
 
05:10:59.390 --> 05:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
we're going is we're improving the
 
05:11:01.390 --> 05:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
funded status and we have a plan to do
 
05:11:03.390 --> 05:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
that the last thing I'll say just
 
05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
because I can't resist I think I've said
 
05:11:07.628 --> 05:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
it anytime I've testified about the
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is you know the basic
 
05:11:12.350 --> 05:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
notion of when you're digging a hole you
 
05:11:14.310 --> 05:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
can either keep digging stop digging or
 
05:11:16.590 --> 05:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
fill in the hole and the plan we have
 
05:11:18.750 --> 05:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
here is to fill in the hole and once we
 
05:11:20.708 --> 05:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
start extending liabilities out into the
 
05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
future once again um you know then we
 
05:11:26.510 --> 05:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
are adding to the Future burden on on
 
05:11:30.628 --> 05:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers um so with that um I I'm
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the board of trust D
 
05:11:34.548 --> 05:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
to respectfully request that the
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee um does not pass this bill and
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
declares it um inexpedient to legislate
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm happy to take
 
05:11:42.320 --> 05:11:43.230 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm happy to take
any

05:11:43.230 --> 05:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you mros
 
05:11:49.708 --> 05:11:49.718 align:start position:0%
represent sure um as I understand it you
 
05:11:51.628 --> 05:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm
 
05:11:54.548 --> 05:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
wrong um a significant portion of what
 
05:11:57.230 --> 05:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
the employers are paying is is to is
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
that amortization and in uh
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
2039 or after 2039 that will end or
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
largely end so what I'm asking is about
 
05:12:10.510 --> 05:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
what portion of what the employers are
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
paying right now is the amortization
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
versus what they should be contributing
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
for pensions for their current employees
 
05:12:20.430 --> 05:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
and by how much would you expect what
 
05:12:23.150 --> 05:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
the employers have to pay to drop after
 
05:12:23.160 --> 05:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
the employers have to pay to drop after
the

05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:27.350 --> 05:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
2039 amortization periods over if we do
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
not uh enact
 
05:12:33.628 --> 05:12:33.638 align:start position:0%
this okay well right right now the uh
 
05:12:36.628 --> 05:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
roughly speaking about 80% of what the
 
05:12:40.070 --> 05:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
employers pay uh toward contributions
 
05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
for their employees is attributable to
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability the vast majority
 
05:12:47.788 --> 05:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
of that is associated with the
 
05:12:50.548 --> 05:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
amortization of the debt out to
 
05:12:52.868 --> 05:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
2039 um there's a very I don't want to
 
05:12:55.150 --> 05:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
get too technical but the the layered
 
05:12:57.390 --> 05:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
amortization approach just started this
 
05:13:00.548 --> 05:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
last um valuation period so there's two
 
05:13:02.948 --> 05:13:02.958 align:start position:0%
years of unfunded liability associated
 
05:13:04.750 --> 05:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
with that that's going to be amortized
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
out of 20 so the the the clearest way I
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
can answer your question is um the
 
05:13:13.390 --> 05:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
original 30-year amortization schedule
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
calls for the payment of all of that
 
05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
amortization of all that unfunded
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
liability so that should reduce that to
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
zero what is an unknown is what the
 
05:13:25.230 --> 05:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
future gains and losses will be between
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:33.390 --> 05:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
20139 thank you thank you other
 
05:13:36.030 --> 05:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
questions I guess
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
um so if if I'm understanding correctly
 
05:13:43.430 --> 05:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
80% of uh what the Employers in you know
 
05:13:45.390 --> 05:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
cities towns the state counties are
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
paying into the pension fund
 
05:13:52.110 --> 05:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
80% is H due to that and is it true then
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
that means that you know
 
05:13:57.190 --> 05:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
assuming that uh the you know that the
 
05:13:58.830 --> 05:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
amount that that things are fully funded
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
going forward and there aren't any
 
05:14:02.470 --> 05:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
misestimates and all that
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
that you'd expect after 2039 that that
 
05:14:06.948 --> 05:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
for you know what they'd be paying would
 
05:14:10.430 --> 05:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
be would that 80% would basically go
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
away that that is the way the
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
amortization schedule should work with
 
05:14:16.548 --> 05:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
regard to that segment of liability yes
 
05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you you're
 
05:14:23.788 --> 05:14:23.798 align:start position:0%
welcome um thank you madam chair that
 
05:14:25.948 --> 05:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
may have been the answer to my question
 
05:14:29.350 --> 05:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
my question was was going to be it's 80%
 
05:14:32.230 --> 05:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
right now does it decline as we get
 
05:14:35.670 --> 05:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
closer to the end of the amotization
 
05:14:40.390 --> 05:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes um yes it does and in fact um it's a
 
05:14:42.990 --> 05:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
30-year anization the first 10 years the
 
05:14:45.708 --> 05:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability actually uh increased
 
05:14:48.190 --> 05:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit because uh of what's called
 
05:14:50.350 --> 05:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
negative amortization we've now crossed
 
05:14:53.070 --> 05:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
over so what we should see using those
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know that that statement with regard
 
05:14:56.910 --> 05:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
to assumptions if there were no further
 
05:14:59.670 --> 05:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
liabilities Associated or increased um
 
05:15:01.230 --> 05:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
it would continue to decline over that
 
05:15:02.548 --> 05:15:02.558 align:start position:0%
period of
 
05:15:05.430 --> 05:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
time representative fellow the repayment
 
05:15:08.750 --> 05:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
is based on a fixed percentage of
 
05:15:11.628 --> 05:15:11.638 align:start position:0%
payroll and so
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
it isn't exactly the same every year but
 
05:15:19.230 --> 05:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
it is it will it will
 
05:15:22.990 --> 05:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
work uh followup basically to that um
 
05:15:26.470 --> 05:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's not sure I understand
 
05:15:29.310 --> 05:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
so what is it why is it that the payment
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
that the mun employers will have to make
 
05:15:34.510 --> 05:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
towards the amortization why will it be
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
going down over time the mortgage you
 
05:15:39.030 --> 05:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
know you pay a mortgage as payments are
 
05:15:40.708 --> 05:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
are fixed it's just how much goes to
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
principal or interest varies how does
 
05:15:45.750 --> 05:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
this can take that one George um this is
 
05:15:49.070 --> 05:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin um as representative U
 
05:15:51.150 --> 05:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
Maguire mentioned employer rates are
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
assessed as a percentage of covered
 
05:15:55.670 --> 05:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
payroll and that's that's not a mortgage
 
05:15:57.150 --> 05:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
concept so sometimes when we use the
 
05:15:59.270 --> 05:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
mortgage analogy Loosely it it doesn't
 
05:16:01.868 --> 05:16:01.878 align:start position:0%
tie exactly together basically you know
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
the idea is if all the assumptions were
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
met you know every single year going
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
forward through 2039 the percentage of
 
05:16:11.788 --> 05:16:11.798 align:start position:0%
pay uh on the rate would not change so
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
if it was you know 14% now for members
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
you you're paying you're still going to
 
05:16:16.750 --> 05:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
be paying
 
05:16:19.990 --> 05:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
14% 10 years from now 15 years from now
 
05:16:23.390 --> 05:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
on a larger payroll base grown through
 
05:16:25.868 --> 05:16:25.878 align:start position:0%
inflation um so in terms of actual
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
dollars year-over-year the contributions
 
05:16:29.708 --> 05:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system are going to
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
continue to grow through through
 
05:16:35.390 --> 05:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
2039 um when the bulk of that initial
 
05:16:38.548 --> 05:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability as of 630 of 17 is
 
05:16:41.548 --> 05:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
paid off and then the dollar amount
 
05:16:43.948 --> 05:16:43.958 align:start position:0%
would would reduce um it still be some
 
05:16:46.548 --> 05:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
liability the the billion or so that's
 
05:16:49.230 --> 05:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
been incurred since 2017 uh mainly due
 
05:16:50.590 --> 05:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
to the Assumption changes and then
 
05:16:52.750 --> 05:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
anything else that were to happen
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
positively or negatively over the next
 
05:16:59.110 --> 05:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 years um so with this bill
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
you'd see the dollar amount being paid
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
continue to rise through
 
05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
2044 um you know at at a higher you know
 
05:17:08.830 --> 05:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
the the curve would continue to the wave
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
would just get higher you know in the
 
05:17:12.548 --> 05:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
total dollar amounts paid in those last
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
years in the 2040s would be you know the
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
highest levels ever you know it it just
 
05:17:17.040 --> 05:17:21.670 align:start position:0%
highest levels ever you know it it just
goes

05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:25.390 --> 05:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Carlin and Mr
 
05:17:32.750 --> 05:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
logos I pa Laura teski
 
05:17:36.830 --> 05:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
tki thank you very much Madam chairman
 
05:17:39.150 --> 05:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
um my name is representative Laura tersi
 
05:17:41.788 --> 05:17:41.798 align:start position:0%
and I represent nashua's Ward 8 which is
 
05:17:45.030 --> 05:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 35 I'll be very brief um I
 
05:17:47.948 --> 05:17:47.958 align:start position:0%
know you've had a very long day um but I
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
did want to take the moment to advocate
 
05:17:52.270 --> 05:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
for my city of NASA as well as the other
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities in the state
 
05:17:56.830 --> 05:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
that are finding themselves struggling
 
05:17:59.548 --> 05:17:59.558 align:start position:0%
with this issue uh the the issue is we
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
need cities and towns need relief now
 
05:18:03.910 --> 05:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing a once- in a-lifetime
 
05:18:05.788 --> 05:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic that came out of nowhere
 
05:18:08.030 --> 05:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
revenues are up in the air and a life
 
05:18:10.150 --> 05:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
raft has to be thrown as soon as
 
05:18:13.470 --> 05:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
possible uh passing this bill or perhaps
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative O'Brien's Bill earlier
 
05:18:17.788 --> 05:18:17.798 align:start position:0%
today is just two possibilities of
 
05:18:20.190 --> 05:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
something that can be done the reality
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
is our retirees and our future retirees
 
05:18:24.270 --> 05:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
are going to be the ones who are
 
05:18:26.868 --> 05:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
actually hit hardest here their property
 
05:18:28.750 --> 05:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
taxes are going to go up and they're
 
05:18:30.510 --> 05:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
going to need to find ways to make ends
 
05:18:33.390 --> 05:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
meet when they're already struggling uh
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
this bill simply provides a little more
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
time to get to that 100% funding I hope
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
you can support the bill for what it is
 
05:18:42.190 --> 05:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
which is simply necessary relief for us
 
05:18:43.750 --> 05:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
to get through this challenging moment
 
05:18:45.230 --> 05:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
that our cities and towns did not
 
05:18:47.390 --> 05:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate and I thank you very much for
 
05:18:47.400 --> 05:18:49.230 align:start position:0%
anticipate and I thank you very much for
your

05:18:49.230 --> 05:18:49.240 align:start position:0%

time are there any
 
05:18:55.628 --> 05:18:55.638 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%

05:19:26.548 --> 05:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
captain from the Manchester fire
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
department and I was a trustee of the
 
05:19:30.430 --> 05:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system Board of
 
05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
Trustees from 1988 to 2001 anyone who
 
05:19:38.670 --> 05:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
was around in the 1990s as I was should
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
remember what took place then and it
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
seems this legislation will bring the
 
05:19:45.990 --> 05:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
retirement system uh down the same path
 
05:19:49.750 --> 05:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
in 1990 uh the legislature decided uh to
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
change the interest assumption rate from
 
05:19:54.510 --> 05:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
8% to 9 and 3/4% and change the
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
methodology from entry age normal to an
 
05:19:59.548 --> 05:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
open aggregate group method by making
 
05:20:01.310 --> 05:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
these changes the state and local
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
Community saved around $72 million
 
05:20:06.190 --> 05:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
needless to say these changes
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
contributed greatly to the system
 
05:20:10.910 --> 05:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
becoming woefully underfunded and these
 
05:20:13.510 --> 05:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
again it's deja vu because that the
 
05:20:15.150 --> 05:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
cities and towns were complaining back
 
05:20:16.350 --> 05:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
then that they didn't want to pay the
 
05:20:19.150 --> 05:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
normal cost uh I bring this up because
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
house bills 39 at 390 will bring the New
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system down the
 
05:20:25.628 --> 05:20:25.638 align:start position:0%
same path as in
 
05:20:28.590 --> 05:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
1990 um currently the unfunded acrude
 
05:20:32.350 --> 05:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
liability uh will be paid off in 20 39
 
05:20:34.470 --> 05:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
enacting this bill will again push the
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
liabilities down the road another five
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
years at an additional cost to the
 
05:20:43.150 --> 05:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
employers of $1.4 billion dollar yes I
 
05:20:45.910 --> 05:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
said billion with a B for every dollar
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
the employer saves today it will cost
 
05:20:51.548 --> 05:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
them $2 in the future Pennywise dollar
 
05:20:53.670 --> 05:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
foolish the New Hampshire retirement
 
05:20:55.470 --> 05:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
system contribution should be based on
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
sound Actuarial procedures and not based
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
on uh what the economy is
 
05:21:05.628 --> 05:21:05.638 align:start position:0%
at this at this P particular time um
 
05:21:07.830 --> 05:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh we have learned from our
 
05:21:09.750 --> 05:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
mistakes in the past and please do not
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
allow history to repeat itself um if you
 
05:21:15.470 --> 05:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
look I I have some old data I don't know
 
05:21:17.628 --> 05:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
what the retirement system has given you
 
05:21:20.270 --> 05:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh today but um if you look at once the
 
05:21:23.070 --> 05:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
unfunded acrude liability is paid off uh
 
05:21:25.230 --> 05:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
the employer normal cost is going to go
 
05:21:28.190 --> 05:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
down astronomically I mean the numbers I
 
05:21:31.350 --> 05:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
have the employees would be uh at uh 1.2
 
05:21:34.350 --> 05:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh 92% teachers will go down to
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
1.86% police will be at
 
05:21:40.548 --> 05:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
5.04% and fire will be at
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
6.35% that is much less than what the uh
 
05:21:47.310 --> 05:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
employee will be paying and even back in
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
the 1990s when they chose to change the
 
05:21:51.750 --> 05:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
methodology and change the interest
 
05:21:53.310 --> 05:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
assumption rate to save the cities and
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
towns money the employees at the time I
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
believe except maybe fire we not but the
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
employees on uh teachers state employees
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe police were paying the
 
05:22:06.670 --> 05:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
employer employee was paying more into
 
05:22:09.190 --> 05:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
the retirement system than the employee
 
05:22:12.548 --> 05:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
so um you know the the unfunded acude
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
liability has to be paid off and the
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
longer we keep pushing this off you're
 
05:22:18.670 --> 05:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
looking at billions of dollars that the
 
05:22:20.190 --> 05:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are going to have to come up
 
05:22:22.830 --> 05:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
with in the future so with that said I
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
would uh please uh appreciate that the
 
05:22:28.708 --> 05:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
committee vote to itl House Bill 390 and
 
05:22:30.628 --> 05:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh I thank you for your time and I'll
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:52.350 --> 05:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:55.470 --> 05:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
pearon I got a question for Mr B if he's
 
05:22:55.480 --> 05:22:56.510 align:start position:0%
pearon I got a question for Mr B if he's
still

05:22:56.510 --> 05:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
still
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
on I am still here if you can hear
 
05:23:03.070 --> 05:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.470 --> 05:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding and I may be
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
confusing the group so this is my
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
question it's my understanding the the
 
05:23:12.190 --> 05:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
organization that which you are
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
president of sounded a very loud alarm
 
05:23:19.590 --> 05:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the 90s warning
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
communities that the actions that were
 
05:23:22.240 --> 05:23:23.948 align:start position:0%
communities that the actions that were
being

05:23:23.948 --> 05:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:23:27.310 --> 05:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
taken and the funding method that was
 
05:23:32.750 --> 05:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
being used was inadequate incorrect
 
05:23:35.190 --> 05:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
in woful negligent was that your
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
organization that sounded that alarm in
 
05:23:39.470 --> 05:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
the early 90s or was it somebody else no
 
05:23:40.990 --> 05:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
it was the permanent firefighters
 
05:23:42.830 --> 05:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
Association that did that and that was
 
05:23:46.430 --> 05:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
when I was seated as a trustee um we
 
05:23:48.670 --> 05:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
warned them back then we even testified
 
05:23:50.948 --> 05:23:50.958 align:start position:0%
before the legislature that it was
 
05:23:52.590 --> 05:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for them to take the
 
05:23:53.868 --> 05:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
authority away from the Board of
 
05:23:56.430 --> 05:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
Trustees at the time to set the interest
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
assumption rates and change the
 
05:24:01.590 --> 05:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
methodology um and uh
 
05:24:04.270 --> 05:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
it went on deaf ears and it was all
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
because the cities and towns and the
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
state wanted to save money at the time
 
05:24:10.990 --> 05:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
and this is what happens when you try to
 
05:24:13.628 --> 05:24:13.638 align:start position:0%
save money um it ends up costing you
 
05:24:15.310 --> 05:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
more in the long run but yes it was the
 
05:24:16.510 --> 05:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State permanent
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
firefighters retirement Association that
 
05:24:22.230 --> 05:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
was on record then and contined to be on
 
05:24:24.030 --> 05:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
record for many years after that that
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
go thank you are there any any other
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:24:36.390 --> 05:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you Mr bodri
 
05:24:39.868 --> 05:24:39.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chairman mayor
 
05:24:43.070 --> 05:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
dones yes Madam uh Madam chair can you
 
05:24:44.788 --> 05:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
05:24:47.868 --> 05:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
yes um all right well I won't
 
05:24:50.548 --> 05:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
repeat some of the testimony that I gave
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
you regarding House Bill 274 concerning
 
05:24:55.750 --> 05:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
the hardship this is going to cause or
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
is causing on taxpayers across the state
 
05:25:01.510 --> 05:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
and representative ters touched on that
 
05:25:03.310 --> 05:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
as well so I will not repeat that but
 
05:25:06.070 --> 05:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
instead talk about the tech you know
 
05:25:08.510 --> 05:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
some of the aspects of this particular
 
05:25:12.510 --> 05:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill now the reason we're here is that
 
05:25:15.788 --> 05:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
the state retirement system reduced the
 
05:25:18.548 --> 05:25:18.558 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return over the next
 
05:25:21.548 --> 05:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
decades uh by half a percent I believe
 
05:25:23.548 --> 05:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
Mr Lagos can correct me if I'm wrong but
 
05:25:28.670 --> 05:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
I think from 675 to 625 or from 725 to
 
05:25:33.070 --> 05:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
675 but reduced it by by half a percent
 
05:25:35.230 --> 05:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
now before that decision was made the
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
the system was 65 or 66% funded uh the
 
05:25:43.868 --> 05:25:43.878 align:start position:0%
reduction in the assumed rate of return
 
05:25:47.788 --> 05:25:47.798 align:start position:0%
uh caused is causing this increase uh
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
over and above what would normally be
 
05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
caused by uh the increase in you know
 
05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
natural increase in wages now again I
 
05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
give you nashal's numbers not because
 
05:25:58.830 --> 05:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
we're different or more important but
 
05:26:00.430 --> 05:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
just because it gives I can give you
 
05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
those those numbers and it gives you a
 
05:26:05.788 --> 05:26:05.798 align:start position:0%
perspective uh we're we're going to be
 
05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
going up from about 25 million to nearly
 
05:26:11.788 --> 05:26:11.798 align:start position:0%
$30 million this year paid into the
 
05:26:14.590 --> 05:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:17.670 --> 05:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
system 80% of which you've heard that
 
05:26:20.868 --> 05:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
four fifths 80% of which are has nothing
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
to do with current employees all has to
 
05:26:26.708 --> 05:26:26.718 align:start position:0%
do with the recapitalization or the
 
05:26:28.830 --> 05:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
building up of the reserves in the
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
pension system 84 of the money we're
 
05:26:34.230 --> 05:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
paying in is for this unfunded liability
 
05:26:36.030 --> 05:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
or on $30
 
05:26:39.390 --> 05:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
million that's about $24 million dollar
 
05:26:43.030 --> 05:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
we paying on an annual basis under the
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
unless you know you you help us with
 
05:26:49.948 --> 05:26:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:54.070 --> 05:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
liability this is nowhere near 1991 this
 
05:26:56.430 --> 05:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
is a totally different
 
05:26:58.270 --> 05:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
situation in
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
1991 decisions were made when the when
 
05:27:04.708 --> 05:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
the fund was 100% which were not sound
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes I mean everybody agrees on
 
05:27:11.628 --> 05:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
that uh which resulted in part in the
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
underfunding that we have faced you know
 
05:27:18.510 --> 05:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 or 15
 
05:27:24.030 --> 05:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
years but right now again we are paying
 
05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
five times under the you know without
 
05:27:32.270 --> 05:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
some relief five times what it takes to
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
support current
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
employees with this uh with this
 
05:27:38.110 --> 05:27:38.120 align:start position:0%
increase in other
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
words 80% of what we're paying is for
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability so we're paying
 
05:27:47.430 --> 05:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
five times what it takes to meet uh the
 
05:27:49.350 --> 05:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
obligations that will be created for
 
05:27:52.868 --> 05:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
current employees back in 19
 
05:27:56.548 --> 05:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
1991 they made a decision which caused
 
05:27:59.868 --> 05:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
the contributions coming in to be less
 
05:28:02.270 --> 05:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
than were necessary even to pay for the
 
05:28:05.070 --> 05:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
current retirees that is not what we're
 
05:28:08.670 --> 05:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
advocating at all we're currently paying
 
05:28:12.190 --> 05:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
five times what it takes for or we would
 
05:28:14.910 --> 05:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
be paying five times what it takes to
 
05:28:16.510 --> 05:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
support current
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
retirees now if you give us this
 
05:28:22.030 --> 05:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
fiveyear relief it will ballpark I mean
 
05:28:24.270 --> 05:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
you could get these specific numbers but
 
05:28:27.708 --> 05:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
ballpark it would about offset the the
 
05:28:30.990 --> 05:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
in our case again just using our numbers
 
05:28:33.548 --> 05:28:33.558 align:start position:0%
the $4 million increase that was caused
 
05:28:36.548 --> 05:28:36.558 align:start position:0%
by the reduction in the assumed rate of
 
05:28:39.590 --> 05:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
return so think about that all right so
 
05:28:42.788 --> 05:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
then we're paying in 25 26
 
05:28:47.190 --> 05:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
million instead of 29 or
 
05:28:50.670 --> 05:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
30 still it's only going to take you
 
05:28:53.070 --> 05:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
know 20% of the 30 million it's only
 
05:28:56.390 --> 05:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to take about 6 million dollar to
 
05:28:58.830 --> 05:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
fund any obligations that would be
 
05:29:01.470 --> 05:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
incurred as a result of current
 
05:29:03.868 --> 05:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
employees so if you give us this relief
 
05:29:06.430 --> 05:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
and our contribution is 25 instead of 30
 
05:29:09.990 --> 05:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever in we will still be
 
05:29:14.030 --> 05:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
paying 18 19 20 million towards the
 
05:29:16.430 --> 05:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability so the idea that we
 
05:29:18.750 --> 05:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
would be digging a hole no we would
 
05:29:21.390 --> 05:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
still be paying millions and millions
 
05:29:25.030 --> 05:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
and millions of dollars every year to
 
05:29:28.390 --> 05:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
help fund help fill this you know help
 
05:29:30.868 --> 05:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh build up the reserves so the idea
 
05:29:32.670 --> 05:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
that we would be digging a hole or this
 
05:29:36.030 --> 05:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
is like 1991 it has there's no
 
05:29:39.030 --> 05:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
comparison no similarity at
 
05:29:42.990 --> 05:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
all I wanted to address the issue of you
 
05:29:45.030 --> 05:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
know this will cause cost more money in
 
05:29:45.040 --> 05:29:46.230 align:start position:0%
know this will cause cost more money in
the

05:29:46.230 --> 05:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
future it's and the home mortgage is you
 
05:29:51.350 --> 05:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
know an approximate
 
05:29:54.030 --> 05:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
analogy if I the cheapest way to buy a
 
05:29:56.270 --> 05:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
house is you know in terms of total
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
dollars out is simply to pay cash just
 
05:30:00.270 --> 05:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
go across the street put down three
 
05:30:02.470 --> 05:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
00,000 and you got the house you don't
 
05:30:04.590 --> 05:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay any interest no future cost
 
05:30:04.600 --> 05:30:05.390 align:start position:0%
have to pay any interest no future cost
no

05:30:05.390 --> 05:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
problem people can't afford to do
 
05:30:11.270 --> 05:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the next cheapest way is like a
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
five or a 10e
 
05:30:16.390 --> 05:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
mortgage less interest than a 30 a lot
 
05:30:19.470 --> 05:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
less you pay less over time but people
 
05:30:21.788 --> 05:30:21.798 align:start position:0%
can't afford that they don't have enough
 
05:30:24.030 --> 05:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
money in the
 
05:30:27.070 --> 05:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
present you can you know 15-year
 
05:30:28.750 --> 05:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
mortgages are available most people
 
05:30:30.350 --> 05:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't do that because they don't have
 
05:30:33.390 --> 05:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
the money so they they the standard is a
 
05:30:33.400 --> 05:30:35.070 align:start position:0%
the money so they they the standard is a
30-year

05:30:35.070 --> 05:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
30-year
 
05:30:39.510 --> 05:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
mortgage um so the IDE so the idea that
 
05:30:41.310 --> 05:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
you know it is somehow illegitimate to
 
05:30:44.670 --> 05:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
say look we just we we uh instead of
 
05:30:46.230 --> 05:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
paying this back
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
over um 23 years we need a little bit
 
05:30:50.240 --> 05:30:51.230 align:start position:0%
over um 23 years we need a little bit
extra

05:30:51.230 --> 05:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
extra
 
05:30:53.590 --> 05:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
time or excuse me instead of paying it
 
05:30:55.628 --> 05:30:55.638 align:start position:0%
over 18 years we need a little extra
 
05:30:58.150 --> 05:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
time that's not so unusual we're still
 
05:31:00.910 --> 05:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
paying it off we're still principal
 
05:31:03.310 --> 05:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
payments every month just not quite as
 
05:31:05.830 --> 05:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
much and the reason we're asking is we
 
05:31:08.788 --> 05:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
can't afford this right now Co and
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
everything else uh this is you know
 
05:31:14.670 --> 05:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
about 15% of the taxes that a taxpayer
 
05:31:18.150 --> 05:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
pays in are for this one line
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
item uh that's for an average homeowner
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's almost ,000 they're paying in just
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
on this one
 
05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
thing so uh it's not so unusual for us
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
to ask for a little time and just to get
 
05:31:34.150 --> 05:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
into a little more Deep In The Weeds
 
05:31:38.230 --> 05:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes in 2043 you know a
 
05:31:39.910 --> 05:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
dollar there would be extra interest
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
paid but if you use sort of a
 
05:31:47.230 --> 05:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
financial methodology money paid out in
 
05:31:50.310 --> 05:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
the future does not have you know has a
 
05:31:52.708 --> 05:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
has Le a dollar paid in 19 years does
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
not have a present value of a dollar it
 
05:31:57.750 --> 05:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
it has the present value of you know you
 
05:31:59.230 --> 05:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
can figure it out depending on the
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of interest but might be 50
 
05:32:05.868 --> 05:32:05.878 align:start position:0%
cents so you know in present day dollars
 
05:32:07.948 --> 05:32:07.958 align:start position:0%
you're really not paying out more
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
money uh yes you're paying dollars that
 
05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
are worth less than a dollar today way
 
05:32:15.548 --> 05:32:15.558 align:start position:0%
in the future but that's pretty
 
05:32:17.868 --> 05:32:17.878 align:start position:0%
Technical and then the weeds so I just
 
05:32:19.868 --> 05:32:19.878 align:start position:0%
go back to the point is we we need
 
05:32:22.750 --> 05:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
relief we would still be paying tens of
 
05:32:26.230 --> 05:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to P to uh settle
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability and giving us a
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
little relief a little little extra time
 
05:32:35.030 --> 05:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
is not going to be the end of the world
 
05:32:37.868 --> 05:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
finally Madam chair I apologize but I
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to make this point I'll try to
 
05:32:41.150 --> 05:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
make it
 
05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
briefly the idea that F the pension
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
systems have to be at 100% make more
 
05:32:49.470 --> 05:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
sense in the private
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
sector if GM goes bankrupt and if they
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
if they punch if their pension system is
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
not 100%
 
05:32:58.958 --> 05:33:00.470 align:start position:0%
not 100%
funded

05:33:00.470 --> 05:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
funded
 
05:33:03.070 --> 05:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
the the pensioners don't get
 
05:33:05.750 --> 05:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
paid because they they get partially
 
05:33:08.350 --> 05:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
paid but mostly
 
05:33:12.350 --> 05:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
not but that is if GM ends and goes
 
05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
bankrupt now we are a state part of the
 
05:33:15.360 --> 05:33:16.788 align:start position:0%
bankrupt now we are a state part of the
United

05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
United
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
States the only way that this pension
 
05:33:21.548 --> 05:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
system and the state of New Hampshire
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
will stop and there would be a necessity
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
to just have in the bank enough to pay
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
out everything without any more
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
contributions would be if the state
 
05:33:35.430 --> 05:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
ceased to exist as an entity because
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise there there's 10 billion in
 
05:33:40.030 --> 05:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
the bank you're getting contributions
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
every year which greatly exceed the need
 
05:33:46.990 --> 05:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
for current retirees so unless the state
 
05:33:50.470 --> 05:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
ceases as an entity whether you're at 60
 
05:33:54.390 --> 05:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
or 80 or 85 or whether it's at 2044 or
 
05:33:57.150 --> 05:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
2039 it doesn't really matter because
 
05:34:00.510 --> 05:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
everyone is always going to be paid
 
05:34:02.390 --> 05:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
the only way the state of New Hampshire
 
05:34:05.548 --> 05:34:05.558 align:start position:0%
will end is if the United States as a
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
country collapses and if that happens
 
05:34:13.470 --> 05:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
pension assets will not be stock markets
 
05:34:15.628 --> 05:34:15.638 align:start position:0%
pensions there won't be anything there
 
05:34:17.788 --> 05:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
so it won't make any difference at all
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
so this sort of Hardline theoretical
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
concept that we have to go to
 
05:34:27.750 --> 05:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
100% doesn't apply that well when you're
 
05:34:30.030 --> 05:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
talking about a government entity or
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
State such as such as New Hampshire so I
 
05:34:37.430 --> 05:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
apologize I went on so long Madam chair
 
05:34:40.190 --> 05:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
but uh I would I'm still available for
 
05:34:44.510 --> 05:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
any questions that um anybody might

unmute I apologize I I was hoping you
 
05:35:41.230 --> 05:35:41.240 align:start position:0%

me what's that H can you hear me now yes
 
05:35:50.030 --> 05:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:53.110 --> 05:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
didn't uh let me uh start
 
05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
over I'm testifying on behalf of the
 
05:35:58.510 --> 05:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
Granite State taxpayers and we want to
 
05:36:00.270 --> 05:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
strongly associate ourselves
 
05:36:03.430 --> 05:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
with the remarks of Marty and George and
 
05:36:06.788 --> 05:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
Mr bodry um I was very heartened to hear
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire retirement system
 
05:36:12.270 --> 05:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
board voted unanimously um to recommend
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
itl on this bill that's our
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation as
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
well the um
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh my professional opinion as a as a
 
05:36:25.990 --> 05:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
pension actuary is that there are
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
important reasons that pension plans
 
05:36:31.350 --> 05:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
should be fully funded at all times to
 
05:36:34.868 --> 05:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
provide security to pension plan plan
 
05:36:37.830 --> 05:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries um and while New
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's system isn't the worst
 
05:36:42.910 --> 05:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
funded state plan of the nation it's its
 
05:36:44.548 --> 05:36:44.558 align:start position:0%
funded ratio of
 
05:36:48.150 --> 05:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
61% is very poorly funded compared with
 
05:36:49.910 --> 05:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
private sector
 
05:36:53.230 --> 05:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
plans no private Pension Plan would be
 
05:36:55.470 --> 05:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
permitted to operate indefinitely with a
 
05:36:57.948 --> 05:36:57.958 align:start position:0%
60% funded
 
05:37:02.270 --> 05:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
ratio the uh pension protection act of
 
05:37:06.830 --> 05:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
2006 provides that large private sector
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
pension plans are considered at risk of
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
defaulting on their liabilities if they
 
05:37:15.628 --> 05:37:15.638 align:start position:0%
have less than 80% funded ratios using
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
standard actal assumptions and the New
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system assumptions
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
are much weaker than standard actal
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
assumptions now uh the New Hampshire
 
05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
system looks bad compared with with
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
other St State plans as well the tax
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation says that in 2019 only 20
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
states have pension plans that are less
 
05:37:40.548 --> 05:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
than two-thirds
 
05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
funded so uh basically all private
 
05:37:49.750 --> 05:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
sector defined benefit plans pursue 100%
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
funding by amortising any shortfalls
 
05:37:55.548 --> 05:37:55.558 align:start position:0%
over seven years and increasing plan
 
05:37:55.558 --> 05:37:56.990 align:start position:0%
over seven years and increasing plan
contributions

05:37:56.990 --> 05:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
05:37:59.910 --> 05:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
accordingly we've heard that we the this
 
05:38:03.750 --> 05:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
is presenting a hardship to uh fund the
 
05:38:06.910 --> 05:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability now and over the
 
05:38:10.190 --> 05:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
future 30 years but really the hardship
 
05:38:11.990 --> 05:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
is caused by the benefits that have been
 
05:38:14.430 --> 05:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
promised and no one is suggesting that
 
05:38:17.070 --> 05:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
those benefits be paired back and if
 
05:38:18.990 --> 05:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen they simply have to
 
05:38:22.750 --> 05:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
be paid for they have to be funded the
 
05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
um we've heard also that this is a a
 
05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
little relief but a billion and a half
 
05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
dollar of extra spending by the state of
 
05:38:32.040 --> 05:38:32.830 align:start position:0%
dollar of extra spending by the state of
New

05:38:32.830 --> 05:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:38:35.628 --> 05:38:35.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire even if those are future Bill
 
05:38:39.230 --> 05:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh dollars is is a staggering amount of
 
05:38:42.190 --> 05:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
money um for the for the state to to
 
05:38:42.200 --> 05:38:43.468 align:start position:0%
money um for the for the state to to
contemplate

05:38:43.468 --> 05:38:43.478 align:start position:0%
contemplate
 
05:38:47.310 --> 05:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
so I would I would really urge that uh
 
05:38:49.910 --> 05:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
an itl
 
05:38:54.868 --> 05:38:54.878 align:start position:0%
um evaluation recommendation on
 
05:39:01.390 --> 05:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
this um basically if if this bill passes
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability will be instead
 
05:39:08.110 --> 05:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
of zero at 2039 it'll be 2.3 billion
 
05:39:12.628 --> 05:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
doll and where's that $2.3 billion doll
 
05:39:13.868 --> 05:39:13.878 align:start position:0%
going to come
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
from glad to take any
 
05:39:19.110 --> 05:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
05:39:24.830 --> 05:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:27.390 --> 05:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
committee I don't see any so thank you
 
05:39:29.670 --> 05:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
very much thank you anyone else who
 
05:39:33.310 --> 05:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on House Bill
 
05:39:37.230 --> 05:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:40.868 --> 05:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
Griffin yes Mr Griffin please speak
 
05:39:42.350 --> 05:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
05:39:44.070 --> 05:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is John
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
L Griffin I'm the CFO for the city of
 
05:39:48.350 --> 05:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
nashille which a position I've held for
 
05:39:51.110 --> 05:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years so I've actually
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
become very familiar with this topic not
 
05:39:56.910 --> 05:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
to uh say what everybody else said I'll
 
05:40:00.150 --> 05:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
get into the specifics of nashor and the
 
05:40:02.430 --> 05:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
kind of the the competing balances that
 
05:40:05.548 --> 05:40:05.558 align:start position:0%
we're trying to weigh but applying the
 
05:40:07.230 --> 05:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
increased employer rates that have been
 
05:40:09.948 --> 05:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
certified by the nhrs for pensionable
 
05:40:12.468 --> 05:40:12.478 align:start position:0%
payroll wages we're going to see an
 
05:40:14.590 --> 05:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
increase as May dous indicative of
 
05:40:16.070 --> 05:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 4
 
05:40:19.030 --> 05:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
million every $2 million for the city of
 
05:40:21.110 --> 05:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
nashor in increased spending or
 
05:40:25.110 --> 05:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
reductions in revenue is 1% on the tax
 
05:40:28.750 --> 05:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
rate therefore this particular increase
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
is 2% % for this P this one item we've
 
05:40:33.948 --> 05:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
been fortunate uh in the city of
 
05:40:35.788 --> 05:40:35.798 align:start position:0%
nashille to keep our spending and our
 
05:40:40.430 --> 05:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
tax increases were under the 3% Mark for
 
05:40:43.548 --> 05:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
probably nine out of the last 10 years
 
05:40:46.190 --> 05:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
so this will put a significant burden on
 
05:40:49.070 --> 05:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
the city uh and as was said previously
 
05:40:50.670 --> 05:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
Services either Services have to be
 
05:40:53.190 --> 05:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
reduced or tax burden on a tax pay as
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
would have to increase the impact of
 
05:40:59.548 --> 05:40:59.558 align:start position:0%
adopting H Bill HB 390 will have the
 
05:41:02.110 --> 05:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
effect of reducing the current nhrs
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
employer rates that have been talked
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
about and this at this time uh given the
 
05:41:10.350 --> 05:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the other pressures on city
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
government as much needed to balance the
 
05:41:14.910 --> 05:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
competing needs that are facing the
 
05:41:17.708 --> 05:41:17.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities I do intend toh provide
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%

off
 
05:43:07.070 --> 05:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:10.070 --> 05:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
speak thank you madam chair yes I I was
 
05:43:13.548 --> 05:43:13.558 align:start position:0%
just going to State um basically the
 
05:43:15.670 --> 05:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
same thing that uh representative
 
05:43:19.830 --> 05:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
O'Brien was saying about um comment
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
about your work affecting uh your
 
05:43:26.070 --> 05:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
marriage quite often uh having been
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
married to a law enforcement officer I
 
05:43:32.310 --> 05:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
know this to be true um in addition to
 
05:43:34.270 --> 05:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
Firefighters police
 
05:43:37.270 --> 05:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
officers uh see some pretty nasty things
 
05:43:40.190 --> 05:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
from time to time and it can't help but
 
05:43:44.030 --> 05:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
affect your mental
 
05:43:49.350 --> 05:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
um well-being um and so I think that um
 
05:43:53.070 --> 05:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
and I I will say I know I've heard
 
05:43:57.310 --> 05:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
previously that uh divorce rates amongst
 
05:43:59.788 --> 05:43:59.798 align:start position:0%
uh First Responders are
 
05:44:03.070 --> 05:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
usually higher than uh the average
 
05:44:05.788 --> 05:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
population and I think it's because of a
 
05:44:09.310 --> 05:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
lot of the job stresses that uh it's
 
05:44:11.670 --> 05:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
difficult you can't even talk about some
 
05:44:14.230 --> 05:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
of these things when you get home so
 
05:44:16.468 --> 05:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for a spouse to
 
05:44:19.910 --> 05:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand those kinds of pressures so I
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
think that um a suicide while it may not
 
05:44:28.548 --> 05:44:28.558 align:start position:0%
seem to be job related quite often it's
 
05:44:32.190 --> 05:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
really a result of the stress on the job
 
05:44:32.200 --> 05:44:34.430 align:start position:0%
really a result of the stress on the job

05:47:55.590 --> 05:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:48:00.270 --> 05:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair yes
 
05:48:02.910 --> 05:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh quick question um I just want to be
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
sure that if members do come in to
 
05:48:08.110 --> 05:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
attend these hearings that the house
 
05:48:09.750 --> 05:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
rule be will be adhered to that if
 
05:48:13.150 --> 05:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
members are in the room they can not
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
have a mask on if they are seated but if
 
05:48:16.350 --> 05:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
they're moving around they must put a
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
mask on I noticed a few times today
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
people were walking around with no masks
 
05:48:20.948 --> 05:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
on and I want to make sure that's going
 
05:48:24.548 --> 05:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.548 --> 05:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
to I believe that that has been the
 
05:48:30.708 --> 05:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
practice but except for the distressing
 
05:48:34.230 --> 05:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
incident of the chair falling over but
 
05:48:37.468 --> 05:48:37.478 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um Can can you please
 
05:48:40.990 --> 05:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
repeat that it's coming kind of
 
05:48:43.590 --> 05:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
garbled representative goalie wants to
 
05:48:48.070 --> 05:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we adhere to the best
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
technique which is we can remove a mask
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
when we're sitting at our seat or when
 
05:48:56.270 --> 05:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
