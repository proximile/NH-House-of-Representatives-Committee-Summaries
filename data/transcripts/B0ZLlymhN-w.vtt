twenty dollars per year

that has been the same since 1977.

adjusting for inflation
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%

that would be over a hundred dollars

today
 
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
SB 88 would raise the cap to a maximum
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
of fifty dollars per year and give each
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
of these associations the ability to
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%

about every tax or fee increase she's
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
ever seen she thinks this is a
 
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
reasonable adjustment given the
 
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
inflation we've experienced in the past
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
few years
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
Senator bird cell thanks you for your
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
consideration and support of Senate Bill
 
00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions on the
 
00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.090 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions on the
committee

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 align:start position:0%

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
yes

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
I see that there are these three
 
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.210 align:start position:0%
I see that there are these three
associations

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
associations
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
are specified
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
is it possible that there are other
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
associations that fall in the same
 
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.550 align:start position:0%
associations that fall in the same
category

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
so I will be able to take um any
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
specific questions to Senator bird cell
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
but I'll have to defer um to her for the
 
00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
response so I can get back to you on
 
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.249 align:start position:0%
response so I can get back to you on
that

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
taking my my question my question
 
00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.290 align:start position:0%
taking my my question my question
um

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.610 align:start position:0%
um
is

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
is this fee per municipality or is it
 
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
per member that might be accessing the
 
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.650 align:start position:0%
per member that might be accessing the
association

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
again I will defer to Senator Regina
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
bird cell and I will have her get back
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
now it is
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.809 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
um somebody uh representative
 
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning and
 
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.749 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning and
welcome

um do you have in line number two the
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
um I will defer to Senator Regina
 
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
bartzell and have her get back to you
 
00:08:06.249 --> 00:08:06.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
hey representative majority how are you
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
um welcome back yeah go ahead
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and it is great to be
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
back um I guess this would be a question
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
to take but well I guess it's a general
 
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
question can legislation have an
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
adjustment factor in it or does it have
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
to be a fixed number I assume an
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
adjustment indicator would bind another
 
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
legisl body and I don't know that you
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
can do that and the only reason I asked
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
that question is I wonder you know in a
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
few years is 50 going to be enough and
 
00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to come back again
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
so does the question make any sense and
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure that it's directed
 
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.130 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure that it's directed
appropriately

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you for your question
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
um I will defer to Senator Universal and
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
have her get back to you with the
 
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.210 align:start position:0%
have her get back to you with the
response

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
I think uh I'll take a stab at it I I
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
think it's safer to do what we do here
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
is increase to a certain number if you
 
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
put an adjustment factor in there
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's inflation or whatever like
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
that you're going to end up with numbers
 
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.750 align:start position:0%
that you're going to end up with numbers
like

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
52.66 and that kind of thing so I think
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
that has been the historical way of
 
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
doing it is actually just adjusting the
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
number that's my assumption any further
 
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.290 align:start position:0%
number that's my assumption any further
questions

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
I have one and I know this will be for
 
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
Regina Bert cell Senator
 
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.670 align:start position:0%
Regina Bert cell Senator
um

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're taking notes on the
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
question uh somebody uh one of the other
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
reps asks about uh the three
 
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:39.970 align:start position:0%
reps asks about uh the three
um

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:39.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
associations that are named and are
 
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
there any others my question is why
 
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
those specific three
 
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:51.740 align:start position:0%

existing language as is the word

Equitable so that's existing but just

only the Bold
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
in the bill is what is changing all the
 
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
other uh wording that is there is
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
existing language already there is no
 
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.150 align:start position:0%

bold
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
the only bold in this one is the dollar
 
00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.630 align:start position:0%
the only bold in this one is the dollar
value

00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
20 scratched out and 50. my apologies
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's fine just no apology needed just
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
pointing it out that
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:11:12.779 --> 00:11:13.970 align:start position:0%
that's why
um

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
well I'll leave it at that
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brown I saw your hand up
 
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.250 align:start position:0%
representative Brown I saw your hand up
no

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman thank you uh I guess
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
along those same lines I was wondering
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
why it says shell pay uh but based on
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
what you just told me it's uh existing
 
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
language so that's correct those type of
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
issues if
 
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
if individuals on the committee have
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
issues with the wordings it that would
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
be good or potential legislation for
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
next for next uh next year you know if
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
you see something you don't like
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out get a bill drafted and
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
make changes for it okay
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Maya
 
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay we have one other
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee uh
 
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
Dan Healy second vice president of the
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire City and town clerks
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
Association we had asked Senator bird
 
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.889 align:start position:0%
Association we had asked Senator bird
cell

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:29.899 align:start position:0%
cell
 
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
to submit this legislation to up the fee
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
to up to fifty dollars I'm not sure what
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
our association's actually going to do
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
if they're going to make the jump to 50
 
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.180 align:start position:0%
or if we're going to stagger it or what
 
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980 align:start position:0%
I believe 50 would be plenty for
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
probably many years to come I don't
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
believe we need to come back to adjust
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
that any higher I can answer some of the
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
questions that were opposed so the
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
annual fee for membership is it's it
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
covers the office so it would cover the
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
town clerk or city clerk in the deputy
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
Clerk of that town so not each person
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to pay for a membership
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
so we are in support of this bill since
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
we requested it and I'd be open to any
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
we have no uh other pink cards we have
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
nobody signed up on the blue sheet so
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
with that we'll close the hearing on it
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
and we have about three or four minutes
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay it is 10 15 we'll go ahead and open
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
up the next Herring on Senate bill 111.
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%

Perkins guaca hope I pronounced that
right

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%

the committee for the record I am
 
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
Senator Rebecca Perkins quoka
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 21 the city
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth and several surrounding
 
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
communities I'm here today to introduce
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
SB 111 and act relative to the Town
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
Council Town manager form of government
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
SB 111 is a request of the town of
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
Newmarket and the New Hampshire
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and serves to
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
clarify the responsibilities and
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
obligation of municipalities that have
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
adopted the Town Council Town manager
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
form of government this helps to clarify
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
issues that have Arisen in the
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
day-to-day management of the
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
municipality where it is unclear if they
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
have certain authorities to act in the
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
exact same manner as a city council
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
the committee Amendment
 
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
um that arose in election law over on
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
this Senate side was raised by the
 
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and it was just to
 
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
ensure that town clerks as Chief
 
00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
election officers and municipalities
 
00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:03.059 align:start position:0%
will continue to be elected positions
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of this statutory
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
clarification so that was one piece that
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
was different between cities and towns
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to clarify that on behalf
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
of the secretary of state which is
 
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
reflected in the version before you as
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
um SB 111 then passed out a committee
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
unanimously and passed on the Senate on
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote so just to clarify you know
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill is to make sure
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
that all town councils have the same
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
Authority as City councils happy to take
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
 
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.250 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
question

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
um do you know what
 
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.230 align:start position:0%
um do you know what
um

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:54.299 align:start position:0%
the we are seek seeking to clarify what
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
was the
 
00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:57.299 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding I guess
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
um in New Market that they thought that
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
they might not have the power
 
00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539 align:start position:0%
um under the current law and that that
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative um and I probably knew
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
the answer to it about six months ago
 
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.710 align:start position:0%
the answer to it about six months ago
but

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I think in general it's just to to
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're not acting
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
outside of their Authority on it on a
 
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:27.539 align:start position:0%
representable Salas
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and you
 
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
you may have alluded to it in your
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
opening there but I noticed that the
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
initially that the um secretary of state
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
did have some some issues and do you
 
00:21:47.289 --> 00:21:47.299 align:start position:0%
know that the bill as amended now
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
satisfies the Secretary of State I do
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
representatives so the issue that was
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
raised was that the Secretary of State
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that the town clerk
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
would be elect an elected position
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of this change and so
 
00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
um under city council operation the town
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
clerk is appointed okay and so this
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
statute essentially says town councils
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
can act under the same authority of city
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
councils with the exception of this
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
procedure related to the town clerk so
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
that satisfied the Secretary of State it
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gallagher
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned this affecting New
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
Market and
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
um one other town which I've already
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
forgotten but Durham yeah New Market and
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
Durham um so I was wondering if there
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
were any others with this form of
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
government that would be affected as
 
00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:46.190 align:start position:0%
government that would be affected as
well

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I am going to
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
defer that to the municipal Association
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
um my question is I'm having difficulty
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
seeing the need for for this particular
 
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.930 align:start position:0%
seeing the need for for this particular
bill

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:23:16.679 --> 00:23:17.390 align:start position:0%
in that
um

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
RSA 49 Dash D colon 1 which defines the
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
purpose and intent which is the section
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
of Statute right before the section of
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
Statute that this bill seeks to
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
to clarify to me when I read that prior
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
section it's very clear that it says
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
that Alternative forms of governance of
 
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.470 align:start position:0%
that Alternative forms of governance of
towns

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:45.980 align:start position:0%
which have the same or similar Powers
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
traditionally found in cities to me that
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
that reads very clear as to what the the
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill seeks to do could you
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
expound on why this bill therefore is
 
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
necessary sure and I
 
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm likely going to defer to the
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
folks behind me there's someone here
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
from Durham and someone from the New
 
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association to
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
address that in more detail
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
okay see no more questions thank you for
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you uh next we'll
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm representative
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan from Durham which
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
actually is I believe
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
I believe there's two towns that
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
currently have a charter which is Durham
 
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
and then Jerry but I I could be you
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
probably want to verify that but we've
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
had this for uh
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
many years and it's worked very well I
 
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
think it's uh I think for a growing I
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
think for uh with a growing complexity
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
of municipal government it's a
 
00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good alternative to the
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting and select
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
board process and there's still like I
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
think if anything there's probably
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
the people have more more input into
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
what the Town Council does into what the
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
select board does in the traditional
 
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
town meeting and it's a more responsive
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
form of government so if you have a town
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
that's like Durham that's
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's only big enough to require a uh a
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
professional uh Town Administrator and I
 
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
don't always agree with everything he
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
does but he's done an excellent job so I
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
think it's just it's a more efficient uh
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
way of governance and it's a
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
it's not as complicated as changing your
 
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:33.049 align:start position:0%
it's not as complicated as changing your
uh

00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
changing your town to a city which I
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
believe no Community has done since I
 
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.230 align:start position:0%
believe no Community has done since I
think

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
Lebanon was the last one that did it did
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
it which was some decades ago um
 
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
I mean a simpler approach
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
um I mean the alternative approach might
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
have been like for example that state to
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
our South where they just allow
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
towns to become cities and then just
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
issue a city Charter that for example uh
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
I think my sister lives in Needham so I
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
think their City charger if I recall
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
correctly uh says something this city
 
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
which shall be known as the town of
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
Needham so I mean that would have been
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
another approach but this is uh
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
this is what we did a number of years
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
ago and I think it's a
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
I think it's a very excellent reproach
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's uh and it allows a certain amount
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
of flexibility for the town
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
um you can have a representative town
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
meeting or just what they call budgetary
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
town meeting or a Town Council Town
 
00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%
manager and former government it's not
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
really much different than a city
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
manager city council a form of
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
government and the
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
significance is a detail about the town
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
clerk I believe is that uh
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
a city clerk is appointed by uh is well
 
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
I guess they can be elected but
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
typically they're appointed and they
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
report to the mayor and of course in a
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
town even a town that has a Town Council
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
and a town manager former Governor
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
they're uh
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
is no there is no mayor you know the
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Town Council is not a
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
mayor they're just a chairman of the
 
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:03.299 align:start position:0%
Town Council so uh the town clerk
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
reports to the people so therefore it's
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have uh
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
when Durham it's been a woman forever so
 
00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
say her um
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
elected by the people and of course in
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
cities they have one or more Awards and
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
they have a clerk and they also have a
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
Selectmen too who are powers are pretty
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
much limited to running the election so
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
and whereas whereas in a town you have
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
a town that has a charter the slick
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
board is basically the Town Council has
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
all the powers of that the select board
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
would have and then so then it's
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate the town clerk to be elected
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
just as in other towns but that's um
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
anyway that's why I that's why that's
 
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
why I support the bill and um I probably
 
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
would defer any technical questions to
 
00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:48.500 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association although I guess
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
you can ask me if you feel like it
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and
 
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and
questions

00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
yes anyway I highly recommend I think it
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
works better than the select board for
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
most communities thanks thank you
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh we have one more pink card nature
 
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:14.570 align:start position:0%
uh we have one more pink card nature
Grace

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and H Grace for the
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we support this
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
bill as I as already stated by Senator
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
Perkins quokka this came at the request
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
of one of our members and was adopted
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
actually as part of our uh policy
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
package that we are asked to advance
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
back in September of 2022.
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
um so there were a couple questions the
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
committee asked that I want to clarify
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
as far as the Town Council
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
um forms of government those include
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
Bedford Dairy Dover Durham hook set
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Merrimack New Market and as
 
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
of well March uh I believe Salem adopted
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
it as well so they're going through that
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
process right now
 
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.130 align:start position:0%
process right now
um

00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
so it's not very many communities
 
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:01.850 align:start position:0%
so it's not very many communities
um

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
I believe representative power asked a
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
question about why is this Clarity
 
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.330 align:start position:0%
question about why is this Clarity
needed

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:07.340 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:10.700 align:start position:0%
the town of Newmarket the town manager
 
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860 align:start position:0%
submitted a electronic letter to you
 
00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:15.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully last night
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
that just clarified there there were a
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
couple issues relative to issuance of
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
bonds and then dealing with state and
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
federal agencies that they see the word
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
town and then they get confused about
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
the process so they're looking for a
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
select board vote but obviously they
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
have a Town Council vote that's what is
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
is approving
 
00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:37.370 align:start position:0%
is approving
um

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
steps in those processes so that's why
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're looking for some more clarity in
 
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419 align:start position:0%
the language of
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
49 D2
 
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:52.220 align:start position:0%
in order to to help alleviate those
 
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
explanatory uh issues
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
um as Senator Perkins stated
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
um the Secretary of State suggested a
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
change just to clarify that we're not
 
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:04.980 align:start position:0%
attempting to change any sort of
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
relationship between the town clerk
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
being elected and that process so that
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
was clarified
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there are any other
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
um local offices that would be affected
 
00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:21.169 align:start position:0%
um local offices that would be affected
um

00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
as far as far as I recall
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
um and so it was good to have this
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
clarification to ensure that they could
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be elected in towns that are
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
Town Council so I'm happy to take any
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question my previous question
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
still stands
 
00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:45.140 align:start position:0%
um if outside
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
agencies or organizations are are having
 
00:30:50.769 --> 00:30:50.779 align:start position:0%
difficulty understanding
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
The Entity that that is before them
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
requesting to do some sort of business
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
why then cannot the Town Council
 
00:31:03.649 --> 00:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
reference the statute 49d colon 1. I
 
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
think that they they do that I think
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
they just have some difficulty
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
explaining it and explaining the
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
multiple choices of local government
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether that's a select board set up
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
town a Town Council town of which there
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
are several variants
 
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
um in terms of budget adoption and
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
everything else which is again going to
 
00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:22.730 align:start position:0%
everything else which is again going to
affect

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
especially in the bonding market and
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
then as well as
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
um cities so
 
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.490 align:start position:0%
um cities so
I

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's really why this bill came about
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
not that it's trying to change any
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
Authority it's just trying to
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
add a line into the into the statute
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
that makes it a little bit clearer that
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
they can point to that that helps those
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
outside agencies well
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
um so my follow-up question is I'd like
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
to understand that do cities towns did
 
00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:58.460 align:start position:0%
they receive some type of a certificate
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
stating what type of governance that
 
00:32:03.889 --> 00:32:03.899 align:start position:0%
they that they've adopted locally and
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
how they operate
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
they do not
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
um they just have the statutory
 
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
Authority and then
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
you know at Town originally it would
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
have been a town they would have had a
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
town meeting they would have had a vote
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
a town meeting to change the form of
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
government they would have adopted uh
 
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
either a charter um which would put them
 
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
as a charter Town
 
00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:30.059 align:start position:0%
um or which is a Town Council town or
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
um they may have adopted uh becoming a
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
city and that would have occurred at
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
some point in time of the past and then
 
00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
they would have
 
00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:39.500 align:start position:0%
updated all of their you know
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
documents labels Etc that they that they
 
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
documents labels Etc that they that they
use

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.810 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
um I I kind of see this as semantic hair
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
splitting I think all the language is
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
pretty clear in the statute as it stands
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't think this bill detracts
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
from it so I don't have an objection to
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
it what I do have a question about and
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
possibly an objection to is the
 
00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:12.059 align:start position:0%
grammatical structure of how the
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
legislation is proposing to be changed
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
so when I look at the existing statute
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
I see the open town meeting invests all
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
legislative Authority in a Town Council
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
as the elected body comma and in the
 
00:33:27.659 --> 00:33:28.330 align:start position:0%
as the elected body comma and in the
original

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:28.340 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
existing legislation that sentence goes
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
on in a very clear way to say or in the
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
alternative vest authority to make
 
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.210 align:start position:0%
alternative vest authority to make
Appropriations

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
whoever drafted the bill
 
00:33:44.769 --> 00:33:44.779 align:start position:0%
that's being presented to us today
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
sticks this phrase with the same powers
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
and authorities as a city council right
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
in the middle of that sentence
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
rendering that sentence almost
 
00:33:57.529 --> 00:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
a non-sequitur
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion would be to
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
have that phrase with the same powers
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
and authorities the city council as a
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
separate sentence somewhere else in the
 
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.789 align:start position:0%
separate sentence somewhere else in the
paragraph

00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
because I think it interrupts the
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
existing sentence in a way that
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
detracts from it making sense
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
I have no objection to any changes you
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you for taking
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
the question this kind of follows up on
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative stavis's
 
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.450 align:start position:0%
representative stavis's
um

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh comments
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the the language that that we're talking
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
about is is uh Town Council getting the
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
same Powers as the city council
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
um how
 
00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
and in this sentence there is a kind of
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
an alternative they can do some
 
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.050 align:start position:0%
an alternative they can do some
um

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
handling of the budget
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
um how
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
how does the city council and the budget
 
00:35:17.339 --> 00:35:19.609 align:start position:0%
how does the city council and the budget
interplay

00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
interplay
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
happen in uh cities versus how the
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
Myriad I guess of ways that it can
 
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
happen in the towns because they can
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
each kind of set up their own interplay
 
00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
and is there
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
um and I guess is this limiting saying
 
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.290 align:start position:0%
um and I guess is this limiting saying
that

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
um that the towns uh that adopt this now
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
have to have that structure for this for
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
that City
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
structure of city council and their
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
power over the budget where they might
 
00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
want to set up a different structure
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
between them the that uh New Town
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
Council and the budget
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
can you kind of talk about that so
 
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:07.810 align:start position:0%
can you kind of talk about that so
um

00:36:07.810 --> 00:36:07.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
at the at its core the
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
there's one town left that still has the
 
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:16.980 align:start position:0%
very basic form of town government which
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
is Benton and they have everything
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
happens at town meeting and that's
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
basically pure democracy and then we
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
have cities where we have representative
 
00:36:28.849 --> 00:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
government so
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
in Concord for instance we uh we elect
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh Representatives the city council they
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
go they do everything
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
um from budget to setting policy
 
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.550 align:start position:0%
um from budget to setting policy
um

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
Town Council towns are in this weird uh
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
and I want to say weird but in this
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
Middle Ground where it's typically
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
larger municipalities
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
and typically it's the case they have
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives that will set policies
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
but but they'll
 
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
different Town Council towns do
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
different things so some of them and I
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
think Hooksett is one of them
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
they have a budgetary town meeting where
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
they still have
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
what you would expect they notice a town
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
meeting everybody comes to vote at the
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
town meeting but the town meeting is
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
really only to vote on the budget
 
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:23.780 align:start position:0%
um it's not on kind of the separate uh
 
00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
all those separate things you would do
 
00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:27.740 align:start position:0%
at town meeting
 
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the intent of this
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
legislation it's not to change the scope
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
of the relationship between what any
 
00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:40.690 align:start position:0%
of the relationship between what any
local

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:40.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
any municipalities voters have chosen as
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
their form of government
 
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.210 align:start position:0%
their form of government
um

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
if there's any implication through the
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
the grammatical structure that there is
 
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
that is certainly not the intent and uh
 
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
I would certainly like that to be
 
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
I would certainly like that to be
clarified

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
um in your answer you said that City
 
00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
councils have the a power to set budgets
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
um in this language it says that we are
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
enshrining that they have the same
 
00:38:14.339 --> 00:38:15.410 align:start position:0%
enshrining that they have the same
powers

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
powers
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
and authorities of the city council so
 
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
therefore in in with this language we
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
would be giving the town councils
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
the authority to the powers to set
 
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.930 align:start position:0%
the authority to the powers to set
budgets

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
00:38:35.329 --> 00:38:35.339 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like there is no
 
00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:36.710 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like there is no
um

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
maybe the reason why they're the um it's
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
not a separate sentence and is saying um
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
is placed before the or is to say or
 
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.510 align:start position:0%
is placed before the or is to say or
um

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
set an alternative budget via some other
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
way is that your maybe interpretation of
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
the structure of this
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
I think that might be right
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
um I didn't write this
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
um my I did have some input but
 
00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.030 align:start position:0%
um my I did have some input but
um

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
really there are
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
several options under Town councils some
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
of which basically operate As Cities but
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
they're still classified as towns
 
00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.630 align:start position:0%
they're still classified as towns
um

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
and then there are some where you have
 
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:29.780 align:start position:0%
what's closer to a traditional Town
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
possibly that's why that's structured
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
one last representative L word and we'll
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
my question Mr Grace
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
out of curiosity
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh did you city councilman persons
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
receive compensation for the
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
I don't know that off the top of my head
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
my in my I believe that they do receive
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
something similar to a stipend but I I
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
don't know off the top of my head all
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Kellum
 
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this follow-up
 
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.069 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking this follow-up
um

00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
so kind of going back to the structure
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
of this and the or it says so you're
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
granting them the same powers and
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
authorities or you're doing something
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
else with the budgetary town meeting
 
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
um and I guess that also brings up the
 
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
question that if you do
 
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.650 align:start position:0%
question that if you do
um

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
if you do something other than the
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
normal budgetary town meeting
 
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.870 align:start position:0%
normal budgetary town meeting
um

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
it seems to the structure of the
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
sentence seems to now throw in to
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
question what
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
now are the authorities and powers of
 
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:01.970 align:start position:0%
now are the authorities and powers of
that

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
um that Town Council because now you
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
have this or that says well now you
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
don't have those Powers anymore so now
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
what powers do you have and so then that
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
would go back to their essential like
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
their Charter or their documents which
 
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.450 align:start position:0%
their Charter or their documents which
is

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:19.940 align:start position:0%
where they should have been
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
delineated in the first place and then
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
this change no longer is like necessary
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
if I can make a suggestion yeah it
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
appears that representative yokella and
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
stavis are both very interested in
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
making sure the grammar of the proposed
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
amendment is correct and I'm happy to
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
work with both of them
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
um to see if we come to some sort of
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
mutual agreement as to what would be the
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
best option uh to clarify this
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
representative save us who had your hand
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
up again
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
taking yet another grammatical question
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
I think this could be easily solved by
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
leaving the existing legislation as it
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
is and just inserting
 
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
just inserting after the word budgetary
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
town meeting period the new wording the
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
Town Council shall have the same powers
 
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
and authorities as you know etc etc
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
that gets away from chopping up that
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
sentence but it makes the point that
 
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
I think that works I'm not the grammar
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
expert but
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
I think there are obviously issues that
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative yokella and stavis have
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
pointed out so
 
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
um unless there are any other other
 
00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
questions I think what we'll do is we'll
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
end this hearing and will allow those
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
individuals to work together to come up
 
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
with something
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
that works if it is indeed needed
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative vehicle
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
okay I have nobody signed in in favor or
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
posed I have no more pink cards so we
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
and we have about five minutes to the
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:41.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:41.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
45 so we will go ahead with the next uh
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
hearing and open up the hearing on SB
 
00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.550 align:start position:0%
hearing and open up the hearing on SB
110

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
110
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
relative to residency status and
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Fenton
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%

Gentlemen of the committee for the
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
record I am Senator Donovan Fenton I
 
00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:08.579 align:start position:0%
represent District 10. I'm here today to
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
talk to you about Senate Bill 110
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the administration of
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
emergency shelter programs by cities and
 
00:49:17.569 --> 00:49:17.579 align:start position:0%
towns this bill provides balance between
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
towns that send their residents to get
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
services in the towns that provide those
 
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.210 align:start position:0%
services in the towns that provide those
services

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire welfare Administration
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
approved the policy to help guide
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
welfare administrators in New Hampshire
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
in regard to residency and temporary
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
housing we are seeing a lot of
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
homelessness in New Hampshire and often
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
people seeking assistance will come to
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
larger towns because the smaller town
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
might not be open or doesn't have a
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
staff shelter or Aid
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
these larger towns will provide
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
assistance or aid but the smaller towns
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily reimbursing them
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
we want municipalities to communicate
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
and coordinate assistance options with
 
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
each other including reimbursements from
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
municipalities of origin
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
anyone who goes to a different town
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
other than their town of residency and
 
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
stays in a hospital treatment program
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
Center emergency housing Arrangement
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
will still remain a resident of their
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
original town until they find more
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
permanent housing
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
towns and cities want to continue to
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
provide support for the residents and
 
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
this bill helps them do so this bill
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
will create an environment where
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
everyone helps fight homelessness and
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
um it's got a this bill has a different
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
title as printed which says
 
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
um it was a new title from what you gave
 
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh relative to residency says I was just
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
wondering if he could could
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
um repeat your the original title again
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
just for comparison and
 
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering why that might have
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
been changed
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
if I unders thank you representative for
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
the question if I understand what you're
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
saying I gave a different title than
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
what the Bill's title is
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh then then what's printed in the
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%

that
apologies

00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question so my my
 
00:51:54.599 --> 00:51:55.609 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question so my my
question

00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:55.619 --> 00:51:56.329 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
refers to a previous section of Statute
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
and that would be 165 colon one where it
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
clearly states that
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
um has to do who is entitled in the
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
local responsibility with regards to
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
providing services
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
and it reads whenever a person in any
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
town is poor and unable to support
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
himself he shall be relieved and
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
maintained by the overseas of Public
 
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
Welfare of such Town whether or not he
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
has residence there
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
so that clearly states that the town in
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
which the the the person finds himself
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
in that is in need of assistance shall
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
receive assistance from that town
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
so does this imply
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
um 165 colon 1
 
00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
to me that implies that that
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility is with that town and
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
with that responsibility would come
 
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
um you know the financial obligation to
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
so to me that it's it's
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
statute is clear
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
could could you comment on on
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
this bill and what it's proposing in in
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
light and in reference to that other
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
statute absolutely thank you for the
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
question I'm not familiar with 165 I
 
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
will say we have uh the municipal
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
Association behind me and legal as well
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
so I would that's a great question to
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
ask them but I will say that this bill
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
was born out of the fact that uh towns
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
are not reimbursing larger
 
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh you know it's a fact I
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
think we have an issue where
 
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
um these smaller towns that necessarily
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
may not have a welfare office or shelter
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
or Aid as I said before are sending
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
their residents to these larger towns
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
and the larger towns are trying to get
 
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but either the town is
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
ignoring them completely or not
 
00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.990 align:start position:0%
ignoring them completely or not
complying

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
complying
 
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.609 align:start position:0%
complying
follow-up

00:53:58.609 --> 00:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my follow-up
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
question Senator so
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
um just again to be clear
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
would you do you agree that current
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
statute there's no Provisions that there
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
shall be any reimbursement to another
 
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.250 align:start position:0%
shall be any reimbursement to another
municipality

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't necessarily agree I would say
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
the the welfare Administration office in
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
put out a release guiding welfare
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
offices on how to being reimbursed by uh
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
the sending towns and
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
what is happening is that is not
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
happening dad so I would think that this
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill is reaffirming the duty
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
four towns to provide for their
 
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.970 align:start position:0%
four towns to provide for their
residents

00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
oh boy a lot of questions
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator thank you chair thank
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so obviously
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
this bill has an FN on it but I was
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
confused by the FN because they're I I
 
00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:09.900 align:start position:0%
don't see I'm trying to understand why a
 
00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:12.059 align:start position:0%
community would have to adjust their
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
budgeting on this when we have a
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
nebulous unfortunately we have this
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
nebulous I don't know how many homeless
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
May transition or or may move here and
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
there I I would think my community would
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
not change its budgeting procedures we
 
00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of whether or not we
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
are compensating or or or or what's the
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
word I'm looking for I can't think of
 
00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
the word I'm reimbursing thank you
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
reimbursing another Community does so I
 
00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:45.059 align:start position:0%
don't understand why there's a fiscal
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
note on it do you can you explain that
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
at all or thank you for the question
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
representative I think the fiscal note
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
came out of
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
um some towns don't even consider it
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
their responsibility to pay for their
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
residents and so they might have to take
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
an account that now you do have to pay
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
for you have a responsibility to pay for
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
the residents who reside in your city or
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
town yeah no thank you
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Senator
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
good to see you again
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
um do you do you think that
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
there's also this issue
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
of municipalities and other states
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
sending not paying for
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
um people that need help that that are
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
getting help in New Hampshire do you
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
think we need to address that issue too
 
00:56:39.359 --> 00:56:40.790 align:start position:0%
think we need to address that issue too
and

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:41.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative um so if I understand
 
00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
that you're worried about you know we
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
border Massachusetts so you're saying
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
or Maine or Maine you're going after
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
Maine no
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think we can address
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
that situation you know I think we are
 
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
focusing on the cities and towns in New
 
00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:58.849 align:start position:0%
focusing on the cities and towns in New
Hampshire

00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think you know Maine
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
cities or towns are like hey go to New
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
Hampshire get their raid they could
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
that's potential
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
um but this is focusing on you know our
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
state our municipalities our cities and
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
towns and really making sure they're
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
um I want to refer back to
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative Powers point about
 
00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.150 align:start position:0%
representative Powers point about
um

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
165 which is extremely clear that towns
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to provide for those
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
who cannot provide for themselves and
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
the problem is and I can speak to this
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
as representative of Lebanon that towns
 
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
and cities that have numerous hotels
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
motels those kinds of facilities are
 
00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:58.870 align:start position:0%
motels those kinds of facilities are
receiving

00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
tremendous number of homeless
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
individuals and distressed individuals
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
because we have those facilities I spoke
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
to our welfare director about this bill
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh and she is looking forward to the
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
time when she can have active
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the surrounding towns
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
of Canaan and Enfield so that that we in
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
Lebanon taxpayers in Lebanon don't have
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
to bear the full burden of providing for
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
residents of Canaan or Enfield who are
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
Indigent so I see this bill as a way of
 
00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
Shoring up 165.
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh in in a in a kind of terrible 21st
 
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
century way when we're faced with this
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
increasing problem of homelessness and
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
indigence across all of our towns
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
I I if there's a question in there I
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
would agree with it
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
um I would say that this really gives
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns an opportunity to
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
negotiate and work with one another
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
versus you know um
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
some municipalities don't even pick up
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
the phone when you call them to ask for
 
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
help or assistance with a with a
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
I I would remind the members of the
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee that we do ask questions and
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh not make statement statements are
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
kind of reserved for our executive
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
session but uh we let that one go
 
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:23.150 align:start position:0%
session but uh we let that one go
representative

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative Elwood
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question Senator all right in
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
um last sentence of the first paragraph
 
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
it says finally the bill requires
 
00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:39.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities to coordinate assistance
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
options with other municipalities when
 
00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
it is determined unreasonable for the
 
00:59:47.809 --> 00:59:47.819 align:start position:0%
person to physically return to the
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
municipality of origin who determines
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
when it is unreasonable for the person
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
to return the the the municipality of
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
origin or the the Locale where the
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
person is at that time well thank you
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the question it's a good question I
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
think it determines on what sort of Aid
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
the individual is receiving if they're
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
in a shelter or if they're in a hospital
 
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
per se I think it comes down to
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
um the extent of the homelessness that
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
the individual is dealing with in terms
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
of emergency housing I think that's the
 
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
determining Factor I'll follow up
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you sir
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
um under Roman V
 
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
um to meet the basic needs of transient
 
01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.430 align:start position:0%
um to meet the basic needs of transient
individuals

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
or residents of other municipalities
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
so is this bill saying that a transient
 
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.870 align:start position:0%
so is this bill saying that a transient
individual

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
versus a resident of the municipality
 
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:03.950 align:start position:0%
versus a resident of the municipality
yeah

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
if someone wanders into a town
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
and I guess is considered what transient
 
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
by the police or I mean someone has to
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
and that person goes to the next town
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:30.020 align:start position:0%
so those two towns have to
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
communicate and coordinate assistance
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
options with each other and I thought
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
the problem and I think it was stated
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
here earlier was municipalities aren't
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
communicating with each other they're

not answering the phone
 
01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:45.549 align:start position:0%
not answering the phone
um

01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
any municipality to coordinate with each
 
01:01:54.119 --> 01:01:55.849 align:start position:0%
any municipality to coordinate with each
other

01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question what compels
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to coordinate with
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
each other's reimbursement of funds uh
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
that transient individual that is just
 
01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.250 align:start position:0%
that transient individual that is just
another

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
instance of what may happen a transient
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
individual's wanders into your
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
municipality as you said that
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
municipality then contacts the
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
municipality or town of origin and says
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
hey your resident is here seeking
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
shelter or Aid this is what we need
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for
 
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
what of the transient individual do you
 
01:02:23.569 --> 01:02:23.579 align:start position:0%
have another question I'm sorry
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
follow-up sir thank you you already had
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
two uh some other people who are looking
 
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.650 align:start position:0%
two uh some other people who are looking
to

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
represents you guys aren't letting me
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
yes Senator yes sir
 
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question of course
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
I understand the the idea of a smaller
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
municipality it's having like in my case
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
that I live in Litchfield which is
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
relatively small although we have almost
 
01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
9 000 inhabitants
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
we have no shelters or anything we have
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
a budget provision for welfare and so
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
forth but if we have a person who
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
becomes homeless
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
they would probably gravitate toward
 
01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:19.700 align:start position:0%
some of the cities and I understand that
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
do the counties which are more Regional
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
do they have any sort of responsibility
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the homeless
 
01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question great
 
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.329 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question great
question

01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:32.339 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
um in terms of this bill does not deal
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
with the counties it deals with the
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the towns and cities
 
01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:40.190 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the towns and cities
um

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
what well the what this bill really is
 
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
about is that
 
01:03:46.849 --> 01:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
you know I think I've stated this before
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
is that you know we have an obligation
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
to those individuals and if we don't
 
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
what stops a town from kicking out all
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
their homeless people and just saying
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
get out
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
and sending them to the big cities where
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
they're building homeless shelters and
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
providing Aid and assistance that's what
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
it really comes down to
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.289 --> 01:04:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:04:13.859 --> 01:04:15.349 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:15.359 --> 01:04:17.270 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
this I I'm kind of
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
um interested in the 30-day
 
01:04:23.579 --> 01:04:25.250 align:start position:0%
um interested in the 30-day
um

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.870 align:start position:0%
um
requirement

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
um kind of from two perspectives one of
 
01:04:33.349 --> 01:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
them is from your
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
um stated goal which is to receive money
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
from the other towns
 
01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
um from that if the person is in their
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter for six months why only
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
30 days should they be in reimburse for
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
they're only a resident for 30 days
 
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
um and from the other perspective what
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
if the a person actually wants to become
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
a resident of this new town why should
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
we forbid them
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
that especially let's say it's you know
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
close to voting time and they want to
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
vote where they're now currently
 
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
residing because they want to go in
 
01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
residing because they want to go in
person

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
um this might require them to you know
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
go get an absentee ballot or travel to
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
another town to vote and because they're
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
not able to establish residency because
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
it's against the law apparently that
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
they are now a resident of the new town
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire right now you you
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
go to a new town you say you're a
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
resident now you're a resident you can
 
01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
go vote there
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
um how how do those interplay I guess in
 
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
your mind
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
um regarding this bill no thank you
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative it's a great question I
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
think the the 30 days is exactly because
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
of voting we don't want them to lose
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
their residency status because they go
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
and seek shelter or Aid in that larger
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
town so we don't want them to say Hey
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
you came in this larger Town you're a
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
resident now you're voting here you know
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
that is what we don't want you know
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
because we don't want them to say well I
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to live in this larger town
 
01:05:59.450 --> 01:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
or city I still want to be a resident my
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
my uh original town and I want to vote
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
there so that's why the 30 days is there
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
to protect them so that they don't have
 
01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:08.339 align:start position:0%
to assume residency in that larger Town
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not saying you can't get
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
there and not be a resident you know
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
anyone can uh register to vote and do
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a follow-up to both my
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
previous question and representative the
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
Ocala's question so
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
um the testimony so far has mostly been
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
focused on emergency housing and just
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
now is turning into elections a bit so
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
um in section two
 
01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.049 align:start position:0%
um in section two
um

01:06:48.049 --> 01:06:48.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to emergency housing
 
01:06:53.569 --> 01:06:53.579 align:start position:0%
governed by the statute number
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
um person does not change his or her
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
residency status
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
while in all those situations so uh I
 
01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:03.299 align:start position:0%
was wondering just
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
um residency status
 
01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:11.180 align:start position:0%
is it it matters for more things besides
 
01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
elections and emergency housing doesn't
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
it um do you have a full list of other
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
places in the rsas where residency
 
01:07:24.049 --> 01:07:24.059 align:start position:0%
status is referenced where this could
 
01:07:25.490 --> 01:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
have an effect
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's a great question representative I
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
don't have a full list I will say that
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
uh there are other people behind me that
 
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
do want to testify on this bill and I
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
think they'd be giving you some some
 
01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:36.299 align:start position:0%
very good concrete answers on a lot of
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
things okay thanks
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative uh I guess we'll go
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly first
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
hi um this is probably a ridiculously
 
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
naive question thank you for taking my
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
time absolutely yes sir um as someone
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
who originally hails from California I'm
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
curious if the state of New Hampshire
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
how does the State of New Hampshire
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
determine who cannot support himself
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
who cannot what the question is that how
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
does the State of New Hampshire
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
determine who cannot support themselves
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
yeah as opposed to
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
I believe I believe someone from the
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
welfare is here so they'll probably have
 
01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
it they'll answer that question for you
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
Senator

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
um you made a statement earlier that
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
said uh and I'm curious why you said
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
this at uh towns are sending residents
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
to other Municipal municipalities versus
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
individuals choosing to be in that new
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
location I I assume they go in there
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
because of the appropriate facilities
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
and services as representative lasalles
 
01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:41.580 align:start position:0%
said so
 
01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
said so
um

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
it kind of prompts my my thought and I'd
 
01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
like your opinion on
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
why the statement that they're sending
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
people there as a as a as a as opposed
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
to people choosing to go to these
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
locations because they have the services
 
01:08:59.150 --> 01:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
I I think it implies something different
 
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I think thank you representative
 
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
the question I think it implies that
 
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
they are sending individuals because
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
they may still be able to offer Aid in
 
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
that original town but they may be full
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
up you know they may not have the option
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
of keeping that individual even if they
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
wanted to so they are sent to a larger
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
town or municipality that can handle
 
01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:21.070 align:start position:0%
town or municipality that can handle
them

01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
taking one more hopefully quick question
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's okay in section five it says
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
municipality should coordinate I just
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understand
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
coordinate for the reimbursement there
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
is no implication here of a a one-to-one
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement it is what you can afford
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
for instance it may cost a lot more in
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
town X than it than I have budgeted for
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
so there is the flexibility in here to
 
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
to coordinate for what each Community
 
01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
can pay correct and that you know what
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
we don't want is lawsuits we're trying
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that one city is ensuing
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
another city for reimbursement
 
01:10:01.199 --> 01:10:02.450 align:start position:0%
another city for reimbursement
okay

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my follow-up question
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
or an additional question so um a lot of
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
the the purpose of the bill is with with
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
regards to receiving reimbursement so my
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
question pertains to line 21
 
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
um do we have us in New Hampshire a
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
statutory definition of a transient
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
individual and the reason I ask that is
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
due to residency in originating
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
municipality for the purposes of
 
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so how would that work uh
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
I don't have a thank you for the
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
question representative I don't have a
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
definition of Transit individual I'm
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
sure the individuals behind me probably
 
01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:47.450 align:start position:0%
sure the individuals behind me probably
do

01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative Edward I know you had
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
another question do you want to hold off
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
for somebody else
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
um I think Diane touched on what where I
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
was going with that thank you
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%

that's what we do
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
all right uh next person uh we have
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:21.020 align:start position:0%
also remind people who are test
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
individuals uh testifying uh in addition

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:11:36.649 --> 01:11:36.659 align:start position:0%
representative Stephen bogert for the
 
01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
city of uh Laconia and we're not quite
 
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
sure if we're far or against this so if
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
I didn't check the box I have uh uh by
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
city and talking with the City of
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
Laconia they were going why should we
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
support this so they are
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
unsure themselves now real quick with
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
the City of Laconia they are the county
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
seat for Belknap County they have the
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
hospital they have the county jail they
 
01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
have the mental health services they
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
have all the things that are what
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
unhoused people look for to come to okay
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
and so we're a receiver City for the
 
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:26.090 align:start position:0%
county and our outside of our County to
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:27.229 align:start position:0%
county and our outside of our County to
[Music]

01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we've done to
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
address this situation is we've created
 
01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:37.580 align:start position:0%
uh uh a housing uh an under housing
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee that is researching this based
 
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
with the mayor and stuff and with all
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
the mental health Society local
 
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
communities and stuff uh
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is I have a homeless
 
01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
encampment 500 feet from my house so I
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
get an opportunity to see the people
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
moving uh these aren't long-term people
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
they come and you can tell a lot of them
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
aren't from our city so they're coming
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
from elsewhere
 
01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
so the question is it they're going to
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
migrate to our city and all the other
 
01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:24.620 align:start position:0%
cities this says like under Section Five
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
the municipality shall communicate and
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're assuming that under RSA 165 colon
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
2 that the other
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
cities these people come from after they
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
get out of jail or after you get out of
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
the hospital or something like that
 
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
these towns they come from are going to
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
pay and that's not clearly true so even
 
01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
though it says they shall pay at some
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
amount we don't know the city carries
 
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
if one was trying to look out how to
 
01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.689 align:start position:0%
if one was trying to look out how to
change

01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities for those receiver
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
cities who have the the fortunate of
 
01:14:15.169 --> 01:14:15.179 align:start position:0%
receiving or being able to provide the
 
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
services to the unhoused maybe it should
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
be a County
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
type budgeted
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
things so that all the cities pay into
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
the county and then each city is not
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
chasing another city for reimbursement
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
it comes automatically from the county
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
you go to your county and get your
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
services and then you submit the bill to
 
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
the county and the county pays it okay
 
01:14:46.010 --> 01:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
and all the other towns are
 
01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:48.659 align:start position:0%
municipalities or whatever within that
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
County have to pay to the county through
 
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
their tax property tax and it takes care
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
of all the budgeting per town and stuff
 
01:14:58.729 --> 01:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
it takes that out of these the equation
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I don't know that that's
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
feasible or not it's just something
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
that's thrown out there and
 
01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.790 align:start position:0%
that's thrown out there and
um

01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
we do see a lot of people come from
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
outside the area we have
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
we've unfortunately had to set up
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
cameras and stuff to watch all of this
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
as it unfolds 500 feet from a
 
01:15:25.689 --> 01:15:25.699 align:start position:0%
residential area
 
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
these are the realities of this
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
situation and the biggest thing of this
 
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
bill if it is to work it a lot of these
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
showers should be if we're going to
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
force the other towns in in villages and
 
01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
whatnot to Fork up then it needs to put
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
the teeth in that
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
so that the receiver cities do get a
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
chance and that the citizens of those
 
01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
cities don't end up footing the whole
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
bill for our area
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
of it and I'm sure there's other larger
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
cities that are stuck in the same
 
01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.890 align:start position:0%
cities that are stuck in the same
situation

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're not quite sure if
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
we're opposed against it it's got some
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
good Beginnings but I think there's some
 
01:16:15.169 --> 01:16:15.179 align:start position:0%
uh more in-depth work it could help to
 
01:16:15.179 --> 01:16:16.330 align:start position:0%
uh more in-depth work it could help to
help

01:16:16.330 --> 01:16:16.340 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
improve the situation for the receiver
 
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:22.940 align:start position:0%
cities and sure up the uh
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
rsas in that manner
 
01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:28.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions
 
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative yokella thank you thank
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
um in on paragraph uh three it says a
 
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
person who who leaves emergency housing
 
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
of their own free will
 
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.970 align:start position:0%
of their own free will
um

01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
and goes on to to say that they shall
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
not be considered to have changed their
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.850 --> 01:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
um in the testimony that we had from the
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
senator it seemed like his implication
 
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:00.659 align:start position:0%
was that they could however this
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
language on line 14 says that she shall
 
01:17:06.649 --> 01:17:06.659 align:start position:0%
not considered to have been changed
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
their residence
 
01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
their residence
um

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
do you do you see that that is taking
 
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
away like the the person's agency to say
 
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
this is where I want to
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
um declare my residency and and do you
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
um that residency
 
01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:25.669 align:start position:0%
um that residency
um

01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
it should be the deciding factor
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
um like you know messing with the The
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
Residency you know standards that we
 
01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
have now in New Hampshire to solve kind
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
of a tangential issue
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
as far as taking care of the health
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
and uh through that may it be physical
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
help or mental health or whatnot where
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
they're resident of is not going to
 
01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
change because being a uh a receiver
 
01:17:59.450 --> 01:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
city of the County Seat you're still
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
going to be required to provide basic
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
support for a person's health may it be
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
through their mental health or drug
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
health or their uh physical help okay
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
the only things that can change through
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
that are some of the other things like
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
they were talking about voting and
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot which I'm not sure how that
 
01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:22.580 align:start position:0%
plays into
 
01:18:25.689 --> 01:18:25.699 align:start position:0%
positive or negatively plays into
 
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to accomplish
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
and as far as people leaving one
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
emergency shelter uh most of the time
 
01:18:38.649 --> 01:18:38.659 align:start position:0%
they'd never even go to these Emergency
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
Shelters uh dear the coldest snaps we've
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
had and up here this past
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
month uh we had our County shelter open
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
for warming so these people could go in
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
there and now we have over 300 homeless
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
people on House people okay and only two
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
people showed up and the rest of them
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
stayed in The Frigid cold
 
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
down at the end of my street where you
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
can see them with their encampments and
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's where they chose to stay over
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
that so the far as the residency is
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
concerned and what it's going to be a
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
hard one to quantify of what are their
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
resident of of the resident of the woods
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
um some clarification about when you
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
said unfortunately we had to set up
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
cameras to monitor this encampment um
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
could you
 
01:19:52.610 --> 01:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
um clarify about
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
um where exactly the had to part comes
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
from like was is there a law requiring
 
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
you to set up cameras or
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
what where where where where does this
 
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
the necessity of the camera came from
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that as the living in a
 
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
dead-end street and you have a constant
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
stream of there's probably anywhere from
 
01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
30 to 50 people ongoing living in this
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
encampment at the end of our street so
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
every morning you get an opportunity to
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
see The Exodus of these people going
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
down to receive the city services of of
 
01:20:41.689 --> 01:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
breakfast and whatever else services
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
that they are receiving and then you
 
01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:48.260 align:start position:0%
give the opportunity for them to return
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
throughout these times that made the
 
01:20:54.610 --> 01:20:54.620 align:start position:0%
requirement of that as you have multiple
 
01:20:59.810 --> 01:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
people with different mental situations
 
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
situations happening in the woods so
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
that you can the the camera is set up to
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
help it's not in the encampment in
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
itself it's towards the entrance looking
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
in so you can monitor people going in
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
and see what they are and who they are
 
01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:26.540 align:start position:0%
and stuff
 
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
the other problems that were preceded
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
we've the people living on this road
 
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
have had their mail stolen out of their
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
mailboxes they've had packages I
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
personally have had to chase one off the
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
front porch of my neighbor's house
 
01:21:46.689 --> 01:21:46.699 align:start position:0%
because he was still in a package
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
and uh the I've had them actually come
 
01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
onto my property and stuff so there's
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
things that intrude into a neighborhood
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
that people don't get a chance to see
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
unless you actually live there as you
 
01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to answer this question I
 
01:22:05.209 --> 01:22:05.219 align:start position:0%
think you've answered it well thank you
 
01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:08.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you for
 
01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:12.980 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:22:25.450 --> 01:22:25.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you much I'm representative
 
01:22:28.729 --> 01:22:28.739 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan for Stratford County
 
01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
District Six which is the town of uh
 
01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
town of Durham and um
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
I mostly came here for the previous bill
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
but this one is a subject in your
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
theater residency because uh we have a
 
01:22:40.199 --> 01:22:41.209 align:start position:0%
theater residency because uh we have a
large

01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:41.219 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
number of uh citizens living the town
 
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
who are students or who are also like uh
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
have just moved to the area recently and
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's you know constant uh
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
we're constantly there's constant mental
 
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
gyrations over the term residency which
 
01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.649 align:start position:0%
gyrations over the term residency which
uh

01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:59.810 --> 01:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
there's certain there's a certain uh
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
segment that believes those people
 
01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
should not be voting in the place where
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
they are in fact living and um
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
that applies perhaps also to the uh
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
unhoused and the transients so this bill
 
01:23:11.159 --> 01:23:12.050 align:start position:0%
unhoused and the transients so this bill
uh

01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:15.410 --> 01:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
so I think it's very important that um
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
if you live if you're a resident of one
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
town and they locate you temporarily to
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
a hotel or motel because not every town
 
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
has a hotel or motel let's say if you're
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
shipped from um
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
say Litchfield over to Bedford or
 
01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:29.209 align:start position:0%
say Litchfield over to Bedford or
Manchester

01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
um and they're putting you shouldn't
 
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
lose your voting rights in your in your
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
previous Town
 
01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.169 align:start position:0%
previous Town
um

01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
and I it's a and uh also
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
even though I think the law already
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
guarantees the spiritual right to vote
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
is also a subparagraph two which we
 
01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:48.830 align:start position:0%
is also a subparagraph two which we
haven't

01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
talked about too much is um if you go
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
um if you're simply you know in a
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
hospital for extended period or you know
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
Treatment Center or even a correctional
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
facility you don't lose your
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
right to vote in the town where you're
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
where you're domiciled which is not
 
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
quite the same thing as residents but um
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
having a residence in town is yet
 
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
generally requirement for domicile like
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
um actually the correctional facility
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
sounds kind of strange because uh
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
you know if you're actually uh convicted
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
and incarcerated
 
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
you lose your right to vote for for that
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
time at least it's a felony but there's
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
a large number of people in jail who are
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
simply awaiting trial or
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
have been convicted of misdemeanors so
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
they don't lose their right to vote as a
 
01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
result of their status and uh
 
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
of course it's also a little bit strange
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
because Correctional Facilities
 
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:41.300 align:start position:0%
accounted for the purposes of the census
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
you know the prisoners are counted
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
where they're incarcerated at the time
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
the census was taken but that's um
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
so and um so anyways if I think it's
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
important that those individuals uh
 
01:24:56.090 --> 01:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
still have residency status and voting
 
01:24:58.370 --> 01:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
is one of the uh reasons why there's
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
others and um and if you obviously if
 
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
you do leave the emergency
 
01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
um housing of your own will it does give
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
you a 30-day grace period to find a
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
residence somewhere else and um
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's also the case
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
and frankly if you move to a homeless
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
encampment unfortunately that probably
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
that probably is a residence so it's not
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
not a very good it's not a very
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
satisfactory residence and if you're
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
just a homeless encampment because
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
you're temporarily absent from some
 
01:25:34.209 --> 01:25:34.219 align:start position:0%
other community uh you're probably
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
should be eligible probably to vote in
 
01:25:38.689 --> 01:25:38.699 align:start position:0%
either place depending on where you
 
01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
consider your domicile is I'm not sure
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
how many of those individuals are
 
01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
worried about voting they've got things
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
much you know lower on the priority of
 
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
needs they're just trying to survive
 
01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.209 align:start position:0%
needs they're just trying to survive
um

01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:50.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.689 --> 01:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a paragraph one
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's language that's already in the
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
law so uh you know it does towns and
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
cities already have the option to send
 
01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.970 align:start position:0%
cities already have the option to send
people

01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
back where they came from if that's
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
possible and that would probably include
 
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
even individuals from out of state um so
 
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
we had one individual who I won't name
 
01:26:16.729 --> 01:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
because he's running for president who's
 
01:26:18.649 --> 01:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
the governor of another state he like
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
recently sent people from his state to
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if that happened here in
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
that existing law would already allow us
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
to put those people back in the plane
 
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
and send them back where they came from
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
I believe but
 
01:26:30.239 --> 01:26:31.129 align:start position:0%
I believe but
um

01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
so anyway I think uh and I one thing I
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
finally underline is if you
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
start paying for the hotel or motel or
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
for some other residents in your new
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
community or if you start paying or if
 
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
you start self-paying for the hotel or
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
motel where you placed on emergency
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
place when you become a resident of the
 
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
new community and um
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
even though
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
even though this does specifically just
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
say four local welfare purposes um
 
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
that uh it is interesting that uh with
 
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
the student voting
 
01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.139 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees that they're paying for
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
a resident in the town where the living
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
world's hitting school and there's also
 
01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
a lot of attempts to somehow redefine
 
01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.270 align:start position:0%
a lot of attempts to somehow redefine
residencies

01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
residencies
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
can we speak to the bill yes um we
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
you've spoken yes four minutes now
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
regarding mostly voting and that kind of
 
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
stuff yes well that is that is one of
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
the reasons uh why this is a good bill
 
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
so they don't lose their rights to vote
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the town where they came from simply
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
because the town is paid for him to move
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and or or because they're
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or they're in a hospital or
 
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
other treatment facility so that's
 
01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:38.219 align:start position:0%
that's just one of the many reasons why
 
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
this is a good build so
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah further quote any
 
01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:44.390 align:start position:0%

at the table of solution finding

01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
there's an old saying
 
01:32:56.110 --> 01:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
that is spoken by municipalities
 
01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes behind closed doors
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
that if
 
01:33:04.010 --> 01:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
you build it I know what you're thinking
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
well they are human beings
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
wherever they are from and we should be
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
mindful of that
 
01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.550 align:start position:0%
mindful of that
however

01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
there is a sensitivity to increased
 
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
for people from elsewhere when
 
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
supporting emergency housing including
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
warming centers
 
01:33:29.689 --> 01:33:29.699 align:start position:0%
sometimes we need to meet concerns where
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
they're at
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
this bill will do that
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
this bill will help mitigate those
 
01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:36.169 align:start position:0%
this bill will help mitigate those

Beyond increased emergency housing is
 
01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
important to note SB 110 complies with
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
the humanitarian intent

01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
call Safeguard language
 
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
and the bill indicates I'm quoting

temporary urgent assistance may need to

this bill
 
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%

I recognize there may be a small
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
minority of municipalities that benefit
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
from the status quo of deferred fairness
 
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
and responsibility also you may hear
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
from some of our Advocate friends and we
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
have many
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
Express uncertainty about the
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
Improvement as change results in

01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
a respect I respect them for tapping the
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
thought breaks however we needed to
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
think differently
 
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:22.860 align:start position:0%
we need to think better
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
even if it's a measured and methodical

even if it's a measured and methodical
Improvement

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
Improvement
 
01:35:29.209 --> 01:35:29.219 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the New Hampshire way
 
01:35:31.729 --> 01:35:31.739 align:start position:0%
it's important to be aware that most
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities play nice in the local
 
01:35:36.649 --> 01:35:36.659 align:start position:0%
welfare sandbox with each other we do
 
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
including the greater Seacoast area
 
01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
which our ethics agreement is modeled on
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
what our practice has been in that area
 
01:35:46.010 --> 01:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
however there are Pockets throughout the
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
state for various reasons
 
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
that will benefit from this narrowly
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%

Amendment to the law
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
this bill will strengthen the
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
relationship with those that already
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
play nice

this bill continues to Auto Municipal

01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
this bill gives municipalities and
 
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
provider agencies a law to site
 
01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
a law to cite something to point to
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
and not to speak of our ethics agreement
 
01:36:44.209 --> 01:36:44.219 align:start position:0%
practices of just being right
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to be part of this effort
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:55.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:57.410 --> 01:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
I may have covered some of the questions
 
01:36:59.209 --> 01:36:59.219 align:start position:0%
you have I did write down some of the
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
questions that you had earlier
 
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind I'd like to address
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
and certainly as long as you can do it
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
quickly you would ask for five minutes
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
you're up to over eight so sorry about
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
that if you could make it very quickly
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely okay as far as
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
very briefly as far as elections this
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
bill this bill the focus is local
 
01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:22.790 align:start position:0%
bill this bill the focus is local
welfare

01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
welfare
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's for local welfare purposes only
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
and that was the intention I did speak
 
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
to the attorney from nhma there might
 
01:37:33.229 --> 01:37:33.239 align:start position:0%
have been a dropping of language which
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
he can speak to next
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
um when from one body to the next or
 
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
when it went when it was amended but he
 
01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:43.100 align:start position:0%
could certainly speak to that
 
01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:45.860 align:start position:0%
also 30 days
 
01:37:50.770 --> 01:37:50.780 align:start position:0%
this this this amendment to RSA 165
 
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
the 30 days is for when someone leaves a
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter rather it's voluntarily
 
01:37:57.649 --> 01:37:57.659 align:start position:0%
or they're exited that does
 
01:37:59.689 --> 01:37:59.699 align:start position:0%
unfortunately happen sometimes so long
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
as they're in emergency housing
 
01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:04.380 align:start position:0%
they are still considered a resident
 
01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:06.659 align:start position:0%
from their place of origin
 
01:38:08.590 --> 01:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
also defines motels
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
used for emergency housing paid for by
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
paid for by agencies not self-paid for
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
except paid for by agencies
 
01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:24.060 align:start position:0%
as emergency housing
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
so that would help mitigate many of the
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that the host municipalities
 
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
have the ones that have the motels the
 
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
ones who have the the homeless shelters
 
01:38:35.890 --> 01:38:35.900 align:start position:0%
warming centers
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
so as long as somebody is in emergency
 
01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
housing they are considered a resident
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
of their town of origin
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's when they leave right because at
 
01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
some point they do need to become a
 
01:38:49.370 --> 01:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
resident of for local welfare purposes
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the new municipality
 
01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:53.570 align:start position:0%
of the new municipality
okay

01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'll end there very good thank you thank
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
you representative uh
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh uh chairman and thank you
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
um so for the case of
 
01:39:12.410 --> 01:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
someone in Manchester where there were
 
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
emergency housing and they decided to
 
01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:18.129 align:start position:0%
emergency housing and they decided to
to

01:39:18.129 --> 01:39:18.139 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
leave that and go to Laconia and
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
and spend their nights in this
 
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.850 align:start position:0%
and spend their nights in this
camp

01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
camp
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
this dead end camp
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
and it's been past 30 days so that would
 
01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
be considered their new residence as
 
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
opposed to where they orig were
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
originally from is that correct
 
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.350 align:start position:0%
originally from is that correct
yes

01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.970 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:50.570 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
um in your statement you often refer to
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
clarifying language
 
01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
um in the previous uh in the senator
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
referenced uh agency
 
01:40:07.729 --> 01:40:07.739 align:start position:0%
um that said that there was some or
 
01:40:08.930 --> 01:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
indicated that there was some
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the for the um other
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities to reimburse the
 
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
receiving municipality
 
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:22.669 align:start position:0%
receiving municipality
um but

01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
is was that uh
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
so that guidance
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
um he was referring to
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
um from this uh Welfare Association and
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
not not actually citing any law that
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
requires those municipalities to
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
um reimburse the
 
01:40:45.229 --> 01:40:45.239 align:start position:0%
um receiving municipality yeah I
 
01:40:46.689 --> 01:40:46.699 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question
 
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
there is a current law which is cited in
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
um regarding reimbursements
 
01:40:53.699 --> 01:40:55.209 align:start position:0%
um regarding reimbursements
um however

01:40:55.209 --> 01:40:55.219 align:start position:0%
um however
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's the other language in the bill that
 
01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.229 align:start position:0%
it's the other language in the bill that
indicates

01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
indicates
 
01:41:02.209 --> 01:41:02.219 align:start position:0%
um I'm paraphrasing it right now but
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
that indicates that emergency housing
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
does not constitute residency for local
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
welfare purposes
 
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
um which would include motels used for
 
01:41:14.169 --> 01:41:14.179 align:start position:0%
emergency housing it's that language
 
01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
that helps to clarify for reimbursement
 
01:41:17.340 --> 01:41:18.850 align:start position:0%
that helps to clarify for reimbursement
purposes

01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:18.860 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
including the 30 days outside of a
 
01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:23.830 align:start position:0%
including the 30 days outside of a
shelter

01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
because current currently someone could
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
leave a homeless shelter and go directly
 
01:41:31.689 --> 01:41:31.699 align:start position:0%
to the Manchester
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
welfare office which they can still do
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
which is they can still do that in
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration and coordination and
 
01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:40.970 align:start position:0%
collaboration and coordination and
um

01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
so I think in that way it clarify same
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
thing with um uh Correctional Facilities
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
currently someone can go from a
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
correctional facility straight to the
 
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
city of concord's welfare office there's
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
nothing borrowing them from doing that
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
currently or in this bill but the
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
municipality can cite where where were
 
01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
where where did you where were you where
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
was your residence prior to
 
01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:07.340 align:start position:0%
prior to the corrections facility
 
01:42:12.649 --> 01:42:12.659 align:start position:0%
and so it helps clarify that the the
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh the reimbursement piece that already
 
01:42:21.169 --> 01:42:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
so you know more questions thank you for
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh last pink card I have
 
01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
is Nate who is always
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
quick and on the point and thank you for
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
I I have been warned uh Nate Grace for
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association we do uh
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
um very briefly as committee members
 
01:42:49.570 --> 01:42:49.580 align:start position:0%
have already pointed out uh 165 colon 1
 
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
requires the town's help
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
um those who are poor and unable to
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
support themselves regardless of their
 
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
residence 165 colon 2 hyphen a says that
 
01:43:02.450 --> 01:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
the cost is borne by the town of or
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
Municipality of residence
 
01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
and the question is well what what
 
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
qualifies a residence for local welfare
 
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
purposes and we have 165 colon 1C which
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to modify here
 
01:43:18.649 --> 01:43:18.659 align:start position:0%
um and really what this is based on is
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
that ethics resolution adopted by the
 
01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
local welfare administrators that's
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
supposed to fill the Gap and say okay
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
what are the parameters where
 
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
one town is pain versus another because
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
the zoo party heard today there are
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
towns that have a large number of
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
services in their towns that don't have
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
any services and so at what point does
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
that residence
 
01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.149 align:start position:0%
that residence
shift

01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
shift
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
the language uh that may have been
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
dropped would be line 15 it doesn't say
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
for local welfare purposes as line 19
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
says that would just modify Roman three
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
the intent here is not to change
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
anything for the purpose of voting
 
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.550 align:start position:0%
anything for the purpose of voting
nobody

01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
in front of you wants anything to do
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
with voting in this bill
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
um and as far as I am aware
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh really it's just to put some
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
parameters around
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
um okay what do we do when we have
 
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:20.699 align:start position:0%
someone from for instance the town of
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
Conway because I know they won't mind if
 
01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
I use them as examples they were just in
 
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
the paper yesterday about this someone
 
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
comes to the town of Conway says the
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
local welfare administrator
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
I need assistance Conway says great but
 
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
all our hotels are full because it's
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
tourist season we have to ship you over
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
to Laconia for instance because that's
 
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
the nearest place we can get a hotel
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
room for you
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
um and then once that person gets to
 
01:44:44.639 --> 01:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
um and then once that person gets to
Laconia

01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
Laconia
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
when if at what time would they shift
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
residents to Laconia that's what this
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to put some parameters
 
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
around and I'm happy to take any
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
questions that maybe have because I'm
 
01:44:59.689 --> 01:44:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
nice job as always nature representative
 
01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:03.590 align:start position:0%
nice job as always nature representative
Brown

01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
one of the clarifications I'd like to
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
get as you you mentioned something I
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
might have misunderstood it but that
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
the sending community
 
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
let's say to from North Conway to
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
Laconia they're required to reimburse
 
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
right look at the receiving location is
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
that complete reimbursement or is it
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
based on the town if it's a small town
 
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
their ability to pay for whatever those
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
services are and is there a limit so I I
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
always get in trouble with my members
 
01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
because I have to tell them that the law
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
under 165 1 just says you have to
 
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
provide the aid it doesn't say you can
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
put a cap on that
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
um so they don't like it when I tell
 
01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.750 align:start position:0%
um so they don't like it when I tell
that

01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.410 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:45:48.410 --> 01:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
most of the time the sending Community
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
does their best to find what
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
assistance they can it's usually pretty
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
simple it's just housing if it's
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
um you know some sort of
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
um assistance program with mental health
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
or something like that it's usually more
 
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
complicated and they'll try their best
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
to coordinate with the welfare
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
administrator in the in the receiving
 
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
municipality they often also you know
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
let the receiving me somebody know hey
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
we're sending this person there
 
01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:24.659 align:start position:0%
there are some issues with communication
 
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
and the hope is that this will spur more
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
communication between municipality so
 
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
they work this out and there aren't
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and there aren't
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
there aren't conflicts between
 
01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:40.430 align:start position:0%
there aren't conflicts between
municipalities

01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead quick follow-up so I just want
 
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's nothing in
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill that requires them to give
 
01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
complete reimbursement is that what
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying it's it's what they can
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
pay or is it an absolute you will
 
01:46:55.729 --> 01:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
reimburse the receiving location thank
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
you correct it's just that they have to
 
01:47:01.490 --> 01:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
coordinate and communicate between each
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
other to figure out what the solution is
 
01:47:08.689 --> 01:47:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
so you know representative color
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
almost missed my chance
 
01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
almost missed my chance
um

01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
so it seems like
 
01:47:23.159 --> 01:47:24.470 align:start position:0%
so it seems like
um

01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.750 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh in uh Roman 4 that if you
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
um if a municipality chooses to
 
01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:37.729 align:start position:0%
um if a municipality chooses to
um

01:47:37.729 --> 01:47:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:37.739 --> 01:47:39.770 align:start position:0%
um
put

01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
um the person in uh housing
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
outside of their municipality their
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of
 
01:47:50.159 --> 01:47:52.910 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of
uh

01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
outlayment or duty to to
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
um to pay for that is 30 days
 
01:48:04.930 --> 01:48:04.940 align:start position:0%
under this current under uh uh
 
01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:09.659 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 because it says that the
 
01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
transition resident after 30 days then
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
the transition residency will go to the
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
new municipality
 
01:48:20.590 --> 01:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
um and so right now
 
01:48:24.649 --> 01:48:24.659 align:start position:0%
the requirement seems to me that there
 
01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's open-ended that they could be uh
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
the sending municipality would could be
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
on the hook forever and this new
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
language would say
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
that the the transition of residency to
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
the new Mississippi new municipality
 
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
will happen 30 days after
 
01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:42.350 align:start position:0%
will happen 30 days after
um

01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
so I I read that differently than you do
 
01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
representative um it's if the person
 
01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
self pays at the at the motel so go back
 
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
to my Conway Laconia example Conway
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
sends somebody to a motel in in Laconia
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
that person after
 
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
two months gets a job they can now
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
afford to pay for the hotel they pay for
 
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:08.219 align:start position:0%
the hotel for 30 days they then lose
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
their job that person's residence he
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
would have transitioned to Laconia
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
because that person is paying for the
 
01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:14.810 align:start position:0%
because that person is paying for the
motel

01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
motel
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
it has to do with with who pays not
 
01:49:20.209 --> 01:49:20.219 align:start position:0%
it's not the time placed on on the
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
municipality so it's not 30 days for the
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
sending municipality it's when there's a
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
break between that person receiving aid
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
how long does that break have to be
 
01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
before they transition for local welfare
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
represent power
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
Graves for taking my question so when I
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
have look at a bill I like to put it in
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
the context of the
 
01:49:50.290 --> 01:49:50.300 align:start position:0%
um entire chapter
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
so you would
 
01:49:55.609 --> 01:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
I asked a question earlier about 165
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
colon 1 and we agree that that
 
01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.390 align:start position:0%
colon 1 and we agree that that
establishes

01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
establishes
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
um where from where the assistant shall
 
01:50:04.810 --> 01:50:04.820 align:start position:0%
come from and then you just mentioned
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
165 colon 2A so my question has to do
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
with 165 colon 1-A and in relation to
 
01:50:17.209 --> 01:50:17.219 align:start position:0%
the the necessity of parts of this bill
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
to me when I read that section it says
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
that any person in a town or city who
 
01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
was poor and unable to support himself
 
01:50:31.970 --> 01:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
shall be known as a town or shall be
 
01:50:34.450 --> 01:50:34.460 align:start position:0%
known as a town or city assisted person
 
01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
and this is the part that I'd like to
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
emphasize and shall be relieved and
 
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
maintained at the expense of the town or
 
01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
city of residence so is it not already
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
clearly established in statute that the
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
city of residents of the individual
 
01:50:54.530 --> 01:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
receiving assistance that municipality
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible to
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
pay for such Services is that correct
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
correct and that's that's repeated in in
 
01:51:08.810 --> 01:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
one 165 to a the issue is
 
01:51:12.169 --> 01:51:12.179 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:51:13.739 --> 01:51:14.990 align:start position:0%
that we have
um

01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:18.590 --> 01:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
people going to uh
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily the case where
 
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
they're being sent to a motel from one
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
municipality to another
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
um but in some cases they're you know
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
showing up to Laconia to
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
other places that have
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
other services that can be provided to
 
01:51:36.659 --> 01:51:37.430 align:start position:0%
other services that can be provided to
them

01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
and then they go to the local welfare
 
01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:42.179 align:start position:0%
office and say hey I came from
 
01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
Conway I hitched a ride over here and
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
I'm now receiving this and I need
 
01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:50.219 align:start position:0%
housing and so you have the
 
01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are kind of the
 
01:51:55.609 --> 01:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
centers for providing these other
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
services in particular are now their
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are bearing the cost even
 
01:52:04.729 --> 01:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
though the residents of the person
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
receiving the services wouldn't
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
under this and under the ethics
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
resolution wouldn't be considered
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
Laconia it would be considered North
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
Conway or whatever the case may be
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's what this is
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
trying to do is provide some clarity to
 
01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:23.510 align:start position:0%
trying to do is provide some clarity to
that

01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.649 --> 01:52:27.659 align:start position:0%
quickly representative yokella thank you
 
01:52:31.850 --> 01:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
um and I want to try and clarify some of
 
01:52:33.169 --> 01:52:33.179 align:start position:0%
your statements that you said before
 
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
that um that the municipality wouldn't
 
01:52:40.370 --> 01:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
be on the hook for the entire amount of
 
01:52:40.380 --> 01:52:41.390 align:start position:0%
be on the hook for the entire amount of
the

01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
um it would be kind of a negotiation
 
01:52:43.619 --> 01:52:45.410 align:start position:0%
um it would be kind of a negotiation
where

01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
um uh is the interpretation of the
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
people that have testified thus far but
 
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
um representative power just read the
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
law that said that they shall be
 
01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:58.609 align:start position:0%
law that said that they shall be
um

01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh maintain at the expense of the town
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
or city of residence so that to me
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
implies that it would be the full 100
 
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
amount shall be required to be paid by
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
the municipality of residents for that
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
um so can you can you um you know
 
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
clarify where you're where you're coming
 
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
from and that it would be a negotiation
 
01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
so I think that Mr Marsh would be better
 
01:53:25.010 --> 01:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
to answer this question about you the
 
01:53:27.410 --> 01:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
best of my ability to answer it
 
01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:28.490 align:start position:0%
best of my ability to answer it
um

01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the costs of local welfare
 
01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.350 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the costs of local welfare
are

01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
um negotiable
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
um because
 
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
it may be the case that the hotel you're
 
01:53:40.729 --> 01:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
working with will cut you a rate because
 
01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
your municipality
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
um because you have certain parameters
 
01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
around the people who are were there it
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
may be the case that uh you know other
 
01:53:51.169 --> 01:53:51.179 align:start position:0%
providers of services
 
01:53:53.689 --> 01:53:53.699 align:start position:0%
are willing to do different things in
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
terms of funding they're obviously
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
private advocacy groups that can help
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
provide funding so
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about costs you know
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
even if you look at something as basic
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
as housing right you can put someone in
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
the Motel 6 you can put them in the
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
Hilton and those are going to have very
 
01:54:10.490 --> 01:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
different nightly costs
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and so part of the negotiation that
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
has to occur between the municipalities
 
01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:20.219 align:start position:0%
um that this is trying to Foster is to
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
enable them to come to
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
kind of the best solution for
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
all the taxpayers rather than you know
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
them going to
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
the host Community the host Community
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
saying well the first phone call we got
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
back was the Hilton store put him there
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
rather than the Motel 6 even though we
 
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:40.860 align:start position:0%
know the Motel 6 has rooms so
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of the problem when when
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
you are a municipality operating outside
 
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
of outside of your own boundary so
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's the intent here and why
 
01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:53.820 align:start position:0%
um you're hearing hearing that from
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
um for the uh for for uh Roman five it's
 
01:55:08.209 --> 01:55:08.219 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
um transient individuals and
 
01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:12.590 align:start position:0%
um transient individuals and
um

01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:15.410 --> 01:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:16.430 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
um

01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
so transient individuals don't actually
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
have a residence that's why it's saying
 
01:55:25.129 --> 01:55:25.139 align:start position:0%
or residents of another municipality so
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
um the transient individual may not be
 
01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
actually known to any of those
 
01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:33.590 align:start position:0%
actually known to any of those
municipalities

01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
um and so they could say that they walk
 
01:55:40.250 --> 01:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
through Bedford and and Fremont and
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
Danville and all of those places but and
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
then you know uh Laconia where they
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
ended up couldn't call all of those
 
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
towns and say Hey you now have to pay me
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
some amount of money because this person
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
said that they show walk through there
 
01:55:58.970 --> 01:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
even though those municipalities have no
 
01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
way of verifying that that person
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
is under the law their responsibility
 
01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
because under the current law they're
 
01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659 align:start position:0%
only responsible for their residence
 
01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
right under the under the current law
 
01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
there they are responsible for paying
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
for their residents even if they're not
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
in that town so what this would do is
 
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
they require them to coordinate and
 
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
communicate so for transient individuals
 
01:56:29.930 --> 01:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
not having a home and there are people
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
who just move from place to place to
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
place around that's
 
01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:38.219 align:start position:0%
more difficult to nail down exactly
 
01:56:40.030 --> 01:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
where the costs are going to be there
 
01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of services were they
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
provided before what kind are available
 
01:56:44.219 --> 01:56:45.830 align:start position:0%
provided before what kind are available
now

01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
um so again uh
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
you know really what the intent here is
 
01:56:51.719 --> 01:56:53.870 align:start position:0%
you know really what the intent here is
to

01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:56.510 --> 01:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
under paragraph five is for that
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
temporary assistance where someone shows
 
01:57:00.649 --> 01:57:00.659 align:start position:0%
up it's negative 20 out and they say hey
 
01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
I don't have anywhere to go tonight you
 
01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
can't let them freeze on the street so
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
you have to provide that emergency
 
01:57:08.570 --> 01:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
assistance and then
 
01:57:10.490 --> 01:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
you as you're talking to them you say
 
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
where do you come from and then you go
 
01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
back and coordinate with that community
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
and it may be the case that they don't
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
live there
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
um they may have lied to you for
 
01:57:19.609 --> 01:57:19.619 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they may come from
 
01:57:20.930 --> 01:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
somewhere else they might not be from
 
01:57:22.430 --> 01:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
the state and obviously we can't recover
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
from out of state
 
01:57:26.750 --> 01:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's another additional hurdle
 
01:57:32.450 --> 01:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Nate thank you thank you I
 
01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
have no more pink cards nobody signed in
 
01:57:40.129 --> 01:57:40.139 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet either way so with
 
01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:44.300 align:start position:0%
that we'll close the hearing on SB 110
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
and we are about 25 minutes behind so we
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
will go ahead and open up the hearing on
 
01:57:50.219 --> 01:57:51.310 align:start position:0%
will go ahead and open up the hearing on
SB

01:57:51.310 --> 01:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
SB
 
01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:52.990 align:start position:0%
SB
222

01:57:52.990 --> 01:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
222
 
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
relative to the definition of broadband
 
01:57:57.410 --> 01:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as Revenue producing
 
01:57:59.330 --> 01:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
facility eligible for municipal revenue
 
01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:01.070 align:start position:0%
facility eligible for municipal revenue
bonds

01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
and I believe uh Senator Bradley
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chair members of the
 
01:58:32.689 --> 01:58:32.699 align:start position:0%
committee pleased to be here
 
01:58:37.129 --> 01:58:37.139 align:start position:0%
um it's the sponsor of Senate Bill 222
 
01:58:40.129 --> 01:58:40.139 align:start position:0%
um I want to thank the co-sponsors
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
including my fellow wolfborough uh
 
01:58:47.570 --> 01:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
resident representative McDonald this is
 
01:58:51.530 --> 01:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
an important bill to I think
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of areas in New Hampshire that
 
01:58:58.390 --> 01:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
have limited access to broadband
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
quite simply put
 
01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:06.649 align:start position:0%
quite simply put
um

01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:06.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
the two changes that are proposed to RSA
 
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:13.209 align:start position:0%
the two changes that are proposed to RSA
33

01:59:13.209 --> 01:59:13.219 align:start position:0%
33
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
and RSA 38
 
01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
would allow the use of
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
Municipal revenue bonds for
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
communication districts communication
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
districts were authorized
 
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
by legislation in the past two or three
 
01:59:33.229 --> 01:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
years as I recall so the towns could
 
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
band together to
 
01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:38.149 align:start position:0%
band together to
create

01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:59:40.609 --> 01:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
Broadband infrastructure obviously
 
01:59:43.330 --> 01:59:43.340 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of funding for
 
01:59:46.370 --> 01:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
Broadband infrastructure we all passed
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
the Broadband Municipal grant program a
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago legislation I was
 
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
pleased to sponsor the Bureau of
 
01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs has gotten a lot of
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds and they've awarded these
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
federal funds both to the New Hampshire
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
Electric Cooperative to CCI as well as
 
02:00:10.609 --> 02:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
dedicating I believe it was 26 million
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
dollars to the Broadband matching brand
 
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
initiative but this is another tool
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
to allow communication districts to have
 
02:00:21.970 --> 02:00:21.980 align:start position:0%
revenue bonds not
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayer bonds but revenue bonds to
 
02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:27.070 align:start position:0%
taxpayer bonds but revenue bonds to
upgrade

02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.129 --> 02:00:36.139 align:start position:0%
there are I believe it's 16
 
02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
communities in Carroll County that have
 
02:00:42.050 --> 02:00:42.060 align:start position:0%
banded together
 
02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:43.790 align:start position:0%
banded together
in

02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
forming a communication District that
 
02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
has been approved by 15 of the 16 member
 
02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
towns recently at their Town meetings
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
only moultonborough has not joined but
 
02:00:59.810 --> 02:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
they have also not voted on this and I
 
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
believe their vote is on May 11th so
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
this this would enable
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
um you know this option should a
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
Communications District seek to Avail
 
02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
themselves of it
 
02:01:17.930 --> 02:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill
 
02:01:21.250 --> 02:01:21.260 align:start position:0%
um it increases the
 
02:01:24.490 --> 02:01:24.500 align:start position:0%
Broadband speed definition to a hundred
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
megabits upload and download or I'm
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
sorry 20 megabits
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
um download it's currently right now 25
 
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
and 3 which for anybody that is
 
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
suffering at that service it really is
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
pretty limited on what you can do on it
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
and so the whole purpose of
 
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
this multifaceted effort is to make sure
 
02:01:52.570 --> 02:01:52.580 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has easily accessible
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
higher speed Broadband for all residents
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire if you are fortunate
 
02:02:02.930 --> 02:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
like I am to live on a main road we most
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
likely have much better access but if
 
02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:07.580 align:start position:0%
you're in a smaller town
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
not necessarily on a main road or even
 
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
some areas of our larger towns and
 
02:02:17.689 --> 02:02:17.699 align:start position:0%
cities you may not have access to this
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
so allowing these communication
 
02:02:24.649 --> 02:02:24.659 align:start position:0%
districts to have access to this feature
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
of revenue bonds not taxpayer bonds it
 
02:02:31.790 --> 02:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
is paid for from the proceeds of the
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
users of a telecommunication District I
 
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
think makes sense having another tool in
 
02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:39.290 align:start position:0%
think makes sense having another tool in
the

02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
toolbox to help Implement Broadband
 
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so with that Mr chair
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:52.729 --> 02:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
the second part of it where it defines
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
Broadband I'm wondering
 
02:02:59.639 --> 02:03:01.010 align:start position:0%
Broadband I'm wondering
um

02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
if this definition of
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
broadband Applause uh
 
02:03:10.609 --> 02:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
solely to
 
02:03:14.209 --> 02:03:14.219 align:start position:0%
the section of law that it's a part of
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
or if it applies throughout to other
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the answer to that
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe somebody else can answer that I
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
can get back to you on it but um
 
02:03:34.609 --> 02:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
obviously the intent of this is to
 
02:03:38.570 --> 02:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
Define Broadband for purposes of these
 
02:03:42.649 --> 02:03:42.659 align:start position:0%
revenue bonds as 100 megabits upload 20
 
02:03:42.659 --> 02:03:43.910 align:start position:0%
revenue bonds as 100 megabits upload 20
download

02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
download
 
02:03:47.209 --> 02:03:47.219 align:start position:0%
so so that when you're considering what
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
an area of either unserved or more
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
likely underserved is that the
 
02:03:57.050 --> 02:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
definition is a higher speed than the
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
lower speed which quite frankly
 
02:04:01.729 --> 02:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
in the way that we're all using
 
02:04:04.930 --> 02:04:04.940 align:start position:0%
Broadband now more and more the higher
 
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
capability is necessary and then if you
 
02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
look on line 19
 
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
um there are also there's also a
 
02:04:18.169 --> 02:04:18.179 align:start position:0%
provision that sort of allows keeping
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
um up to date with whatever
 
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
transformation transmission speeds are
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
um adopted by the Telecommunications Act
 
02:04:32.209 --> 02:04:32.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question just to
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
clarify what you just said so um in
 
02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
lines I guess it would be 16 and 17 that
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
language is changed or added to
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
addressed underserved areas yes because
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of areas that are served
 
02:04:54.119 --> 02:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of areas that are served
to

02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
um a very low speed
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
I think all of us are finding
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
increasingly that more and more capacity
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
is necessary
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
um especially if you have you know a
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
large family unit
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
um using
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
your Broadband Wi-Fi network at the same
 
02:05:19.250 --> 02:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
time it just is absolutely essential
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
that they're for purposes of defining
 
02:05:24.589 --> 02:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
what underserved is that the speed be
 
02:05:24.599 --> 02:05:28.810 align:start position:0%
what underserved is that the speed be
increased

02:05:28.810 --> 02:05:28.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question you may
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
or may not be able to answer this
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
question but technology of course is
 
02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
changing what we used to be satisfied
 
02:05:48.669 --> 02:05:48.679 align:start position:0%
with with dial up many years ago
 
02:05:51.169 --> 02:05:51.179 align:start position:0%
certainly we're not satisfied with that
 
02:05:54.129 --> 02:05:54.139 align:start position:0%
today we're we're
 
02:05:58.189 --> 02:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
interested in instant uh Communications
 
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
there I'm just wondering in rural areas
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
where fiber optics cables it might be
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
prohibitively expensive in order to
 
02:06:13.790 --> 02:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
serve those is satellite internet
 
02:06:17.450 --> 02:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
an alternative uh I I think it probably
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
over time will be an alternative but um
 
02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know the testimony that we've heard
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
as we've
 
02:06:28.189 --> 02:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
sort of liberalized the opportunity for
 
02:06:31.129 --> 02:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
towns to participate in this over the
 
02:06:34.729 --> 02:06:34.739 align:start position:0%
last several years through revenue bonds
 
02:06:36.609 --> 02:06:36.619 align:start position:0%
through creation of the
 
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:39.300 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications district is while
 
02:06:43.010 --> 02:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's out there it still has some issues
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
that could be involved in terms of being
 
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
able to reach it its costs it's it's
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
availability I think it in the long run
 
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
is probably an answer but
 
02:06:59.930 --> 02:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
I think all of us need internet service
 
02:07:04.490 --> 02:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
and the pandemic showed us that but you
 
02:07:06.169 --> 02:07:06.179 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire is blessed with
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
people wanting to live here and work
 
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
remotely so that's an issue
 
02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:12.649 align:start position:0%
remotely so that's an issue
um

02:07:12.649 --> 02:07:12.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:12.659 --> 02:07:14.270 align:start position:0%
um
obviously

02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
our kids are learning more online now
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
and that clearly was the case in the
 
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic but I think to a certain extent
 
02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
continues to be the case
 
02:07:27.169 --> 02:07:27.179 align:start position:0%
medical visits are happening more and
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
more online so it's it's really
 
02:07:31.550 --> 02:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
important and
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I think even though satellite
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
um starlink is going to be something in
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
the future it's not readily available at
 
02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
a price that most people can afford now
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative viocella
 
02:07:51.169 --> 02:07:51.179 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:07:51.179 --> 02:07:53.390 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

02:07:53.390 --> 02:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:55.669 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.679 --> 02:07:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the so you're this definition of
 
02:08:05.050 --> 02:08:05.060 align:start position:0%
broadband is changing the definition of
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
underserved communities
 
02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:09.010 align:start position:0%
underserved communities
um

02:08:09.010 --> 02:08:09.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:13.609 --> 02:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
Statewide and no longer just using that
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
Federal Communication standard so when
 
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking and comparing to other
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
states New Hampshire going forward would
 
02:08:23.639 --> 02:08:25.550 align:start position:0%
states New Hampshire going forward would
be

02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
um just saying that they that we may
 
02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
have a larger population of underserved
 
02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
communities compared to other states if
 
02:08:36.530 --> 02:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
they were using this Federal commission
 
02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:38.450 align:start position:0%
they were using this Federal commission
guidelines

02:08:38.450 --> 02:08:38.460 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
02:08:41.089 --> 02:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
um and I was wondering if you
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
thought about the impact of of
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
communicating in that way versus
 
02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:47.570 align:start position:0%
communicating in that way versus
um

02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:50.689 --> 02:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
uh it seems like your intention was
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
mostly to allow these Municipal revenue
 
02:08:59.089 --> 02:08:59.099 align:start position:0%
bonds to be able to be utilized only for
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
going up to the 100 100 megabits a
 
02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
second and there is a definition section
 
02:09:06.050 --> 02:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
within that
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
um Revenue Municipal Revenue Bond
 
02:09:11.930 --> 02:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
section that this could just clarify in
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
there that this section should only be
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
used to go up to 100 megabits I'm just
 
02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had a thought about
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
that messaging and saying that New
 
02:09:25.070 --> 02:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is vastly underserved because
 
02:09:27.290 --> 02:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
we set our own higher standard than the
 
02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:28.189 align:start position:0%
we set our own higher standard than the
Federal

02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
02:09:31.070 --> 02:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
standard so that's that's a good point
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I think the messaging is also that if
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
we are underserved we're doing something
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
about it and
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a pretty important
 
02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
selling point I've I've talked to
 
02:09:43.609 --> 02:09:43.619 align:start position:0%
realtors that um
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
have indicated to me that
 
02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:48.050 align:start position:0%
have indicated to me that
um

02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
properties that were for sale in towns
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
that I represent that did not have you
 
02:09:55.970 --> 02:09:55.980 align:start position:0%
know good access
 
02:09:57.770 --> 02:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
um had a
 
02:09:57.780 --> 02:09:58.970 align:start position:0%
um had a
um

02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:01.310 --> 02:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
the opposite of a premium a big discount
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
quite frankly at a time that you know
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
our real estate market is pretty hot
 
02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have good access to
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
Internet so I think
 
02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:11.270 align:start position:0%
Internet so I think
um

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:13.370 --> 02:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
people that want to come here and and
 
02:10:15.229 --> 02:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
all of us that live here know how
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
important it is to have this so I think
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
the I think the messaging that you know
 
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
has occurred over the last several years
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
starting with
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
allowing Municipal bonding in a town
 
02:10:32.270 --> 02:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
then allowing telecommunications
 
02:10:34.609 --> 02:10:34.619 align:start position:0%
districts then
 
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
um you know the governor's efforts and
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee's acceptance of funds
 
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Electric Co-op and
 
02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:44.209 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Electric Co-op and
for

02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:10:46.370 --> 02:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
um CCI
 
02:10:49.310 --> 02:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to build out networks the
 
02:10:52.089 --> 02:10:52.099 align:start position:0%
Broadband matching Grant initiative that
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
those of us that were here last year all
 
02:10:57.530 --> 02:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
voted for the funding that's going in
 
02:10:59.570 --> 02:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
there I think the you know in terms of
 
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
the messaging we're doing a lot to try
 
02:11:04.070 --> 02:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
to upgrade our Broadband but I will also
 
02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
tell you somebody who's you know
 
02:11:08.330 --> 02:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
represented areas of the state you know
 
02:11:10.490 --> 02:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
considered the North Country even though
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
I live in Wolfeboro
 
02:11:15.770 --> 02:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
um you know there are big pockets of New
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are rural that are
 
02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
underserved and it's been like this for
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
years where
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
um you know as technology improves their
 
02:11:27.410 --> 02:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
air is a state that improved a lot
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
faster sooner and I would hope that this
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
is one more tool in the toolbox to help
 
02:11:35.930 --> 02:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
those areas the state that aren't going
 
02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:37.010 align:start position:0%
those areas the state that aren't going
as

02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions for Senator
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.550 --> 02:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.169 --> 02:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry that you're still here
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
having to struggle through all these
 
02:12:19.609 --> 02:12:19.619 align:start position:0%
bills it is afternoon but
 
02:12:22.209 --> 02:12:22.219 align:start position:0%
um thank you for allowing me to testify

and all the representatives of the
 
02:12:30.129 --> 02:12:30.139 align:start position:0%
municipal and County committee

my name is Carol Monroe do you do me a
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
favor and pull the mic just a little
 
02:12:37.729 --> 02:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
closer to you I can thank you
 
02:12:37.739 --> 02:12:38.689 align:start position:0%
closer to you I can thank you
um

02:12:38.689 --> 02:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair of the board of a company
 
02:12:43.129 --> 02:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
called valleynet and valleynet is a
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
construction management and operations
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
company for East Central Vermont
 
02:12:51.169 --> 02:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
telecommunications District so the
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
concept of a communication district and
 
02:12:55.609 --> 02:12:55.619 align:start position:0%
the ability to fund it with Municipal
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
revenue bonds is not new and it's
 
02:13:01.010 --> 02:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
happening and it's happened in our
 
02:13:03.169 --> 02:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
neighboring state but also across the
 
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
country in other Municipal areas
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
easy fiber as it's better known has 7
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
000 customers and 1500 miles of network
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
and a great deal of that network has
 
02:13:17.770 --> 02:13:17.780 align:start position:0%
been built with Revenue
 
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
bonding Municipal Revenue bonding which
 
02:13:22.729 --> 02:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
is of course very attractive to
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
investors because it's taxable you know
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
it's not taxable in the state and for
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
income taxes as well as on a federal
 
02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
side and so the
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
so the revenue bonds that this District
 
02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
puts out working through of course a
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
bond company
 
02:13:44.089 --> 02:13:44.099 align:start position:0%
they're sold out on the day that we we
 
02:13:46.729 --> 02:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
deploy you know we we offer them I guess
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's the word I want
 
02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:49.729 align:start position:0%
that's the word I want
um

02:13:49.729 --> 02:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
EC fiber has been so successful that
 
02:13:55.490 --> 02:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
that the first 23 towns very rural area
 
02:13:58.970 --> 02:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
in in East Central Vermont are
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
um are fully built out and has accepted
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
another eight towns adjoining that to
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
build out fiber to their premises
 
02:14:10.189 --> 02:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
and they have been
 
02:14:10.199 --> 02:14:10.970 align:start position:0%
and they have been
um

02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:13.550 --> 02:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
ebitda positive and cash flow positive
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
since 2015. they have been on time with
 
02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
their bond payments and bond debt and
 
02:14:24.050 --> 02:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
have a success that could be used in
 
02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
other communication districts here in
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't have to tell you and and you
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
have my comments by the way in your
 
02:14:35.569 --> 02:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
email that significant Broadband has
 
02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
proven to be a necessity uh for each and
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
every home and Business in New Hampshire
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
and during the last pandemic years has
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
become essential to the average
 
02:14:44.639 --> 02:14:45.790 align:start position:0%
become essential to the average
household

02:14:45.790 --> 02:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
household
 
02:14:49.450 --> 02:14:49.460 align:start position:0%
telemedicine was a very immature
 
02:14:52.129 --> 02:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
technology solution prior to the
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic today it's an option for you
 
02:14:58.010 --> 02:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
know for everyone at any time provided
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
you have a broadband connection that can
 
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
allow you to do some face-to-face online
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
with your your physician and for those
 
02:15:09.890 --> 02:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
that don't live close to a hospital or
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
to a an area in which you have you have
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
all these Specialists close to Dartmouth
 
02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
close to Concord the rest of the state
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
has to travel a great distance for some
 
02:15:24.169 --> 02:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
of these services but telemedicine and
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
and Telehealth has helped to solve that
 
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
I actually used it not too long ago and
 
02:15:33.169 --> 02:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
um I was amazed at the quality of my
 
02:15:34.970 --> 02:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
service now mind you I live in Dublin
 
02:15:38.569 --> 02:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
and we are lucky to have partnered with
 
02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
a ISP with CCI so we do have Broadband
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
in Dublin New Hampshire but many areas
 
02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.290 --> 02:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
the current legisl the unserved areas in
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire spread throughout the
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
state although primarily in the Western
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
and the Northern areas of New Hampshire
 
02:16:00.169 --> 02:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
and often cable services are available
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
in the downtown areas of these of the
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
towns or business districts
 
02:16:07.970 --> 02:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
but not available where the housing
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
density is very low
 
02:16:14.169 --> 02:16:14.179 align:start position:0%
and so when you define
 
02:16:16.609 --> 02:16:16.619 align:start position:0%
unserved areas this is an important
 
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
aspect because you have to get through
 
02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
those served areas to serve those
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
unserved areas and many much of the
 
02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:25.870 align:start position:0%
unserved areas and many much of the
funding

02:16:25.870 --> 02:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:27.550 align:start position:0%
funding
Associated

02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
Associated
 
02:16:30.050 --> 02:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
and restricted by the current
 
02:16:32.089 --> 02:16:32.099 align:start position:0%
legislation the current what's currently
 
02:16:35.209 --> 02:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
in the RSA doesn't allow you to use
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal Bond funding or any bond
 
02:16:40.250 --> 02:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
funding to build where others have
 
02:16:42.410 --> 02:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
already built but you need to get
 
02:16:45.290 --> 02:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
through that area to get to those that
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
desperately need Broadband so increasing
 
02:16:52.490 --> 02:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
the unserved definition will help that
 
02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:55.549 align:start position:0%
the unserved definition will help that
situation

02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.849 --> 02:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
revenue bonds Municipal revenue bonds
 
02:17:01.969 --> 02:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
are the responsibility of the in this
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
case the communication District it's not
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
unlike what we do for sewer districts
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
and water districts
 
02:17:10.250 --> 02:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
and so the responsibility for payment of
 
02:17:13.629 --> 02:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
those bonds is with the the revenue
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
within the district not to the average
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and so any revenues
 
02:17:22.730 --> 02:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
the any payment of the revenue bonds
 
02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
will be coming from those that actually
 
02:17:27.530 --> 02:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
utilize that service and not through
 
02:17:30.770 --> 02:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:32.990 --> 02:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's been pretty clear over the last few
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
years that 25 3 which is the definition
 
02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
of broadband the FCC uses
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
has used in the past
 
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
is not adequate it is not adequate
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
Broadband for those individuals or
 
02:17:50.330 --> 02:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
households here in New Hampshire
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
even the FCC acknowledges that because
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
all of the most recent funding coming
 
02:17:59.150 --> 02:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
from the FCC uses the 120 which is what
 
02:18:01.209 --> 02:18:01.219 align:start position:0%
we're asking this change to take place
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
120 as a definition
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
um for Broadband unserved areas so
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
anything not not served with 120 is
 
02:18:14.209 --> 02:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
considered underserved or unserved and
 
02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
it's those areas that the funding is
 
02:18:18.889 --> 02:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
targeted for so this is just changing
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
the language within our own rsas to
 
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
bring it up to a more current definition
 
02:18:27.410 --> 02:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
of what Broadband really is
 
02:18:31.009 --> 02:18:31.019 align:start position:0%
it's important I think that we have all
 
02:18:32.690 --> 02:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
the tools in the toolbox we can possibly
 
02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:34.669 align:start position:0%
the tools in the toolbox we can possibly
imagine

02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
02:18:36.650 --> 02:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
um getting to that house or that group
 
02:18:39.290 --> 02:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
of houses at the end of the dirt road a
 
02:18:41.929 --> 02:18:41.939 align:start position:0%
mile in is an expensive endeavor
 
02:18:43.730 --> 02:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
I'd like to think that satellite
 
02:18:46.129 --> 02:18:46.139 align:start position:0%
services would do that it's not quite
 
02:18:47.810 --> 02:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
there yet
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
um you might have seen Elon musk's
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
starlink satellites if you have an
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see them in the sky
 
02:18:57.410 --> 02:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
they're very beautiful but they go
 
02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
across the sky like a path but how many
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
of those can he keep putting up into our
 
02:19:06.290 --> 02:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
our atmosphere to support not only all
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
of us but all of the rest of the world
 
02:19:12.650 --> 02:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's um they're trying they're grappling
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
with that and so it's not a a
 
02:19:19.330 --> 02:19:19.340 align:start position:0%
it's not a done deal how's that
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
and it's not hasn't been has proven not
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
to be consistent or reliable so
 
02:19:27.889 --> 02:19:27.899 align:start position:0%
ultimately perhaps that's going to be a
 
02:19:29.929 --> 02:19:29.939 align:start position:0%
solution but it's not a solution today
 
02:19:32.209 --> 02:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to make sure that every
 
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
premise here in New Hampshire
 
02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
all the way out to the end of that dirt
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
road has the ability to have adequate
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
Broadband at a speed over a hundred and
 
02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
over 20.
 
02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
um we I heard some questions about
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and whether or not
 
02:19:51.010 --> 02:19:51.020 align:start position:0%
that was too high of a standard
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
your neighboring Vermont the standard in
 
02:19:56.570 --> 02:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
Vermont is 100 over a hundred
 
02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
um so you know it is that is where
 
02:20:00.650 --> 02:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
states are going at this time Maine as
 
02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:01.730 align:start position:0%
states are going at this time Maine as
well

02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and I think that's uh adequate at
 
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
this time 100 over 20. the cable
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
companies can deliver 100 over 20 on the
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
current cable networks so I think that's
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
the 20. fiber can deliver 100 over a
 
02:20:20.210 --> 02:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
hundred without any problems at all
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions you
 
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
might have and once again I want to
 
02:20:25.849 --> 02:20:25.859 align:start position:0%
remind you that I did send it out in an
 
02:20:28.969 --> 02:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
email so you have my notes or if you'd
 
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
like a copy I have those representative
 
02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
like a copy I have those representative
lasalles

02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
lasalles
 
02:20:35.210 --> 02:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
clarifying that satellite question that
 
02:20:44.090 --> 02:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
I had previously do you know and uh if a
 
02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:45.130 align:start position:0%
I had previously do you know and uh if a
current

02:20:45.130 --> 02:20:45.140 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:20:50.210 --> 02:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
served underserved map of the state of
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:58.490 --> 02:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
um not at this time and so the current
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
FCC maps are they're all waiting to be
 
02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
approved they've been there are
 
02:21:08.050 --> 02:21:08.060 align:start position:0%
challenge locations throughout the state
 
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
where people are had the map show they
 
02:21:14.090 --> 02:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
have service and and the individuals
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
have challenged that that information
 
02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
they don't have service
 
02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
um and vice versa though there are some
 
02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
that show that they don't have service
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
and there are companies who are
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
challenging that so the maps aren't
 
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
final yet and the next round of what we
 
02:21:31.849 --> 02:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
call Bead funding which is coming from
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government is waiting on
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
those maps to be accurate so
 
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
um we have an idea of you know who will
 
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
be sir who is served or I hate to use
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
the word underserved because either
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
you're served or you're not served but
 
02:21:51.050 --> 02:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative yokella thank you
 
02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:55.490 align:start position:0%
representative yokella thank you
um

02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:57.650 --> 02:21:57.660 align:start position:0%
you talked about these maps that are
 
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
being created at the federal level
 
02:22:03.370 --> 02:22:03.380 align:start position:0%
um are they using the
 
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
120 standard for that that
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
um new map
 
02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:11.030 align:start position:0%
um new map
um

02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:14.690 --> 02:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
and uh also is
 
02:22:16.730 --> 02:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
you seem to indicate that they're
 
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
already moving towards that 120 standard
 
02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:22:21.479 --> 02:22:22.690 align:start position:0%
and so
um

02:22:22.690 --> 02:22:22.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
it seems like that that if this
 
02:22:30.650 --> 02:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
um does not pass it was still likely
 
02:22:33.250 --> 02:22:33.260 align:start position:0%
become into effect once the Federal
 
02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
Regulations get updated is that not the
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
case there's no indication at the FCC
 
02:22:43.730 --> 02:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
when they will officially change the 25
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
3 definition
 
02:22:48.410 --> 02:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
but but all of the materials that have
 
02:22:51.950 --> 02:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
been coming out have in their in their
 
02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:52.610 align:start position:0%
been coming out have in their in their
um

02:22:52.610 --> 02:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh Federal funding documents indicated
 
02:22:59.809 --> 02:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
the 100 over 20 as a definition so they
 
02:23:02.090 --> 02:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
haven't they haven't changed it formally
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
at the FCC but they're using the other
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
so we have no idea when that will happen
 
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
and even if they feel the necessity to
 
02:23:12.770 --> 02:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
have to have it happen and so to tie us
 
02:23:16.690 --> 02:23:16.700 align:start position:0%
to the FCC low definition I think is
 
02:23:20.809 --> 02:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:24.650 --> 02:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
can you comment on whether the map would
 
02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
be be reflecting the the current
 
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
standard or the 20010 so when you when
 
02:23:33.469 --> 02:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
you go into the map itself you can
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
pinpoint a location and it will tell you
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
what providers are there and what
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
service they provide service so if it's
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
25 3 it will say something similar to
 
02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
that if it's 100 over 20
 
02:23:49.389 --> 02:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:52.370 --> 02:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a couple for you
 
02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:55.790 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a couple for you
um

02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:57.410 --> 02:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
in your opinion you don't have to give
 
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
me an exact estimate but in your opinion
 
02:24:03.490 --> 02:24:03.500 align:start position:0%
when do you think uh satellite internet
 
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:13.309 align:start position:0%
will be
available

02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.610 --> 02:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
not in the near future
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
um he it
 
02:24:21.650 --> 02:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
it's starlink is doing well
 
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
in certain areas at certain times of the
 
02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
day it can deliver the speeds that it
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
has said it can
 
02:24:31.849 --> 02:24:31.859 align:start position:0%
but in in other areas it's inconsistent
 
02:24:34.610 --> 02:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
and unreliable
 
02:24:36.349 --> 02:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
um so they're they're of course working
 
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
on that but part of the issue is how
 
02:24:40.610 --> 02:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
many satellites do you put up in the
 
02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:41.570 align:start position:0%
many satellites do you put up in the
orbit

02:24:41.570 --> 02:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
orbit
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
in order to serve
 
02:24:46.450 --> 02:24:46.460 align:start position:0%
premises 24 7
 
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
consistently well enough so that you can
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
depend on it enough so that you would
 
02:24:54.410 --> 02:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
want your emergency services to to
 
02:24:56.929 --> 02:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
depend on it and that's it's not there
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
yet I I'm thinking three to five years
 
02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
we might see some progress to that or he
 
02:25:08.030 --> 02:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
may find it too expensive to put up the
 
02:25:09.889 --> 02:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
number of satellites required to make it
 
02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
consistently reliable
 
02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
my correct there are other companies
 
02:25:17.570 --> 02:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
though that have in the past have
 
02:25:21.050 --> 02:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
have operated uh satellite internet or
 
02:25:23.809 --> 02:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
different types of companies yeah
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and the reason I bring this up kind
 
02:25:28.010 --> 02:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
of along the lines of Representative
 
02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:29.530 align:start position:0%
of along the lines of Representative
lasalles

02:25:29.530 --> 02:25:29.540 align:start position:0%
lasalles
 
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley mentioned uh last term a
 
02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
bill that put a lot of money tens of
 
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars
 
02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:42.300 align:start position:0%
to run lines in underserved markets or
 
02:25:44.110 --> 02:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
not serve markets in the North country
 
02:25:47.210 --> 02:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
and at that time I don't quote me on
 
02:25:49.250 --> 02:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
this but when you did the math at how
 
02:25:50.690 --> 02:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
many people they were going to serve how
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
many households versus how much money we
 
02:25:54.650 --> 02:25:54.660 align:start position:0%
were putting out it ended up being some
 
02:25:56.690 --> 02:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
ridiculous amount like twenty thousand
 
02:25:59.929 --> 02:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
dollars per household I mean just insane
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
amount of money to spend for for that
 
02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
amount of coverage so
 
02:26:05.399 --> 02:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
amount of coverage so
oh

02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:26:09.290 --> 02:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
When I See This I and that's the reason
 
02:26:11.690 --> 02:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
I asked you the question about how long
 
02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:13.130 align:start position:0%
I asked you the question about how long
um

02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:16.969 --> 02:26:16.979 align:start position:0%
as an example GPS that is that's
 
02:26:19.610 --> 02:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
operates worldwide
 
02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:20.270 align:start position:0%
operates worldwide
um

02:26:20.270 --> 02:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
airplanes use it cars use it uh
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
everybody here has probably use it on
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
some on their phones I mean it's it's
 
02:26:31.309 --> 02:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's something that that works so I'm
 
02:26:31.319 --> 02:26:32.469 align:start position:0%
it's something that that works so I'm
just

02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
questioning the
 
02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:39.660 align:start position:0%
the question ultimately comes to is in
 
02:26:41.330 --> 02:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
three to five years let's say it's three
 
02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:42.230 align:start position:0%
three to five years let's say it's three
years

02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
and satellite is available and it's uh
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
extremely cost effective and now the
 
02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
towns have gone out with these bonds
 
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
and you end up at the situation like
 
02:26:56.210 --> 02:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
Burlington Vermont or some of these
 
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
other ones that
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
have crashed and then who's going to be
 
02:27:03.050 --> 02:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
responsible for those bonds is it going
 
02:27:05.150 --> 02:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
to be the town districts who took them
 
02:27:08.090 --> 02:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
out or is it going to be the entire
 
02:27:11.929 --> 02:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
State taxpayers asked to subsidize it um
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's a concern of mine what would you
 
02:27:15.770 --> 02:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
say to them
 
02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
so I understand your concern as a town
 
02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
that has gone out and and not used
 
02:27:23.450 --> 02:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
revenue bonds but regular General
 
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
obligation bonds to partner with
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Communications to run fiber
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
to the premise
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
um three years ago
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that no one in town is
 
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
disappointed with that and that they all
 
02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
are willing to pay the premium because
 
02:27:41.929 --> 02:27:41.939 align:start position:0%
we pay an extra 11 a month on our bills
 
02:27:45.530 --> 02:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
which covers the cost of the bond
 
02:27:50.270 --> 02:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh and it uh it is it's working great
 
02:27:53.210 --> 02:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
now is the town ultimately responsible
 
02:27:55.250 --> 02:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
should something happen to Consolidated
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
Communications we would own the network
 
02:27:59.389 --> 02:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
and be able to provide another find
 
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
another provider the fiber is up on the
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
polls and the equipment is available
 
02:28:07.969 --> 02:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
however in this case we're looking at
 
02:28:10.490 --> 02:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
Municipal revenue bonds so a
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
communication District would have the
 
02:28:14.210 --> 02:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
ability to put out Municipal revenue
 
02:28:16.010 --> 02:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
bonds which would be based on the
 
02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
revenue of that communication District
 
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
not on an individual taxpayer and so if
 
02:28:24.590 --> 02:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
it should go under it would be the
 
02:28:26.929 --> 02:28:26.939 align:start position:0%
assets and the ownership of the re and
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
it's the revenue of the district that's
 
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
backing those bonds
 
02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:31.670 align:start position:0%
backing those bonds
and

02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:31.680 --> 02:28:32.389 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
and and so you know there is that risk
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
but the investors outside investors and
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes investors within the towns if
 
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
that should they desire that we'll be
 
02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.090 align:start position:0%
that should they desire that we'll be
paying

02:28:44.090 --> 02:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
paying
 
02:28:46.130 --> 02:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
um will be
 
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
who would be the the individuals that
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be hurt right these would be
 
02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
Municipal revenue bonds it's a utility
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that that would occur it's
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
um the the experience
 
02:29:03.410 --> 02:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
um of EC fiber is that once these are
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
your customers it is a it is just like a
 
02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
utility you uh the the churn rate is
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
very low and they have routinely been
 
02:29:16.309 --> 02:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
able to cover operations and their Debt
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
Service like any other company
 
02:29:21.889 --> 02:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I think that you have
 
02:29:24.650 --> 02:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
the asset up there if if it should fail
 
02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
there would be another operator who
 
02:29:31.370 --> 02:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.290 --> 02:29:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no more questions thank
 
02:29:34.849 --> 02:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony we have one more
 
02:29:47.410 --> 02:29:47.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:49.849 --> 02:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
I was about to say good morning but good
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
chairman Turca representative power and
 
02:29:54.770 --> 02:29:54.780 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:29:57.050 --> 02:29:57.060 align:start position:0%
my name is Catherine heck and I
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:30:00.650 --> 02:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
Association and today we are here to
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
voice our strong support for this
 
02:30:04.969 --> 02:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
additional enabling legislation that
 
02:30:07.130 --> 02:30:07.140 align:start position:0%
creates a new Financial tool for
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
communication districts to form and move
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
forward with revenue bonds which I think
 
02:30:15.770 --> 02:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
um as Monroe did an excellent job of
 
02:30:18.050 --> 02:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
explaining how revenue bonds are very
 
02:30:20.150 --> 02:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
different from General obligation bonds
 
02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
and how they function they are widely
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
used Nationwide and even here in New
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for water sewer projects for
 
02:30:29.889 --> 02:30:29.899 align:start position:0%
example other Utilities
 
02:30:32.330 --> 02:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
in larger cities they might use them for
 
02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
a bridge project and collect a road toll
 
02:30:37.370 --> 02:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
for example to pay for them so the onus
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
risk Falls onto the investor rather than
 
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer so it's it's quite a
 
02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
different um situation and I did want to
 
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
address that over the last four years
 
02:30:50.750 --> 02:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire there's been a
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
great deal of legislation passed that's
 
02:30:55.130 --> 02:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
enabling we're not a home rule state so
 
02:30:58.130 --> 02:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
that municipalities can continue on the
 
02:30:59.870 --> 02:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
work of building out Broadband to their
 
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
residents much like I think at some
 
02:31:03.590 --> 02:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
point in time the federal government
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
realized that landlines were a necessity
 
02:31:08.570 --> 02:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
we're starting to realize internet is a
 
02:31:11.690 --> 02:31:11.700 align:start position:0%
necessity as well I think that I heard
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
the comment about satellites it is
 
02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
unlikely anytime soon that satellites
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
are going to take over
 
02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
um the share of the market over fiber
 
02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
optic because of reliability and
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
affordability those are the two reasons
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
why we don't anticipate that happening
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
and that's widely
 
02:31:34.490 --> 02:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
understood right now in the industry as
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
far as the mapping is concerned New
 
02:31:39.770 --> 02:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the office of business and
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs and their Broadband
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
initiative division has taken on mapping
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
broadband and if you go onto their
 
02:31:50.809 --> 02:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
website Broadband NH
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
they partnered with UNH to create a
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Broadband map so that we
 
02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
can better understand our served and
 
02:32:00.770 --> 02:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
underserved locations because as already
 
02:32:02.750 --> 02:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
stated several hundred million dollars
 
02:32:05.809 --> 02:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
through federal funds has throat flowed
 
02:32:07.250 --> 02:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
in through New Hampshire these were not
 
02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
state general funds these were federal
 
02:32:12.050 --> 02:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
dollars to continue to build out
 
02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
Broadband especially in our most
 
02:32:17.210 --> 02:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
unserved areas recently just in February
 
02:32:20.330 --> 02:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
CCI successfully received a bid to build
 
02:32:22.490 --> 02:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
out in the North Country for 40 million
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
dollars and that will be taking place
 
02:32:26.210 --> 02:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
over the next several years to bring
 
02:32:27.889 --> 02:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
Broadband because it's incredibly
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
expensive to get Broadband you know in
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
those rural areas hanging that wire much
 
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
like it was with telephones the
 
02:32:36.889 --> 02:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
difference is back in the day telephone
 
02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
companies received a monopoly and had to
 
02:32:41.750 --> 02:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
serve 100 of the people living with the
 
02:32:44.750 --> 02:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
copper today we don't have monopolies so
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
we have to have these other Financial
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
Tools in order to bring Broadband to all
 
02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
of our residents in a different way we
 
02:32:54.290 --> 02:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
have great tools already we have public
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
private Partnerships communication
 
02:32:58.250 --> 02:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
districts have been able to be formed
 
02:32:59.870 --> 02:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
and then we have the federal dollars
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
coming in which again do require that
 
02:33:04.429 --> 02:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
100 over 20 in order to even apply for
 
02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
the grant you have to guarantee that
 
02:33:08.690 --> 02:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
you're going to build out at that speed
 
02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
in order for that the government to know
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
that it's a good investment in the
 
02:33:14.809 --> 02:33:14.819 align:start position:0%
future because we continue to see those
 
02:33:17.809 --> 02:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
speeds um changing and getting faster
 
02:33:19.730 --> 02:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
so I'm certainly happy to take any
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have for me I'm
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
not a Broadband expert however I do
 
02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
understand the financial components and
 
02:33:28.429 --> 02:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
how important this is for the certainly
 
02:33:31.490 --> 02:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
the 16 towns or the 15 currently that
 
02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
have joined this Communications District
 
02:33:34.969 --> 02:33:34.979 align:start position:0%
because they're unable to take advantage
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
of some of the opportunities they maybe
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
didn't qualify to receive the funding
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
directly from the federal government in
 
02:33:44.809 --> 02:33:44.819 align:start position:0%
this way perhaps they were served enough
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the state chose to go into a
 
02:33:49.130 --> 02:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
different location with some of the
 
02:33:51.650 --> 02:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
federal dollars and they're maybe not
 
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
desirable for a public-private
 
02:33:55.250 --> 02:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
partnership or P3 under the Chesterfield
 
02:33:57.469 --> 02:33:57.479 align:start position:0%
model like my own town Greenfield and we
 
02:33:58.969 --> 02:33:58.979 align:start position:0%
just heard that Dublin did which
 
02:34:01.010 --> 02:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
everyone is extremely satisfied with so
 
02:34:02.710 --> 02:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
they're looking for another
 
02:34:05.389 --> 02:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring that Broadband to
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
their community at no risk to the
 
02:34:11.870 --> 02:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.410 --> 02:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
nice job four minutes I try
 
02:34:17.330 --> 02:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
02:34:18.650 --> 02:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
02:34:21.290 --> 02:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
Catherine for your testimony
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
all right I have no more pink cards uh
 
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
we have one signed up in favor on the
 
02:34:28.429 --> 02:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
blue sheet and with that we will close
 
02:34:32.929 --> 02:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
the hearing on Senate Bill 222
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.710 --> 02:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:43.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:34:43.610 --> 02:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
we will open up the hearing now on
 
02:34:49.010 --> 02:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 78 relative to subdivision
 
02:34:51.770 --> 02:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
regulations on the completion of
 
02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:55.490 align:start position:0%
regulations on the completion of
improvements

02:34:55.490 --> 02:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
I show Senator Innis
 
02:35:14.110 --> 02:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:16.370 --> 02:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon chairman
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
turcotte and members of the committee
 
02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm Dan Ennis representing District 7. I
 
02:35:23.809 --> 02:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
live in Bradford New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
here to introduce Senate Bill 78. the
 
02:35:28.370 --> 02:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
lack of affordable housing is one of the
 
02:35:29.809 --> 02:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
main obstacles facing New Hampshire
 
02:35:32.450 --> 02:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
families and our state's economy too
 
02:35:34.190 --> 02:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
often government policies make building
 
02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
housing more expensive than it needs to
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
be current law authorizes local planning
 
02:35:41.870 --> 02:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
boards to require security such as a
 
02:35:43.730 --> 02:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
performance bond or irrevocable letter
 
02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
of credit against completion of a
 
02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
subdivision which all makes sense the
 
02:35:50.210 --> 02:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
law also requires that towns release
 
02:35:53.210 --> 02:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
that security as the work is completed
 
02:35:55.010 --> 02:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
I've heard from Builders around the
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
state that these regulations aren't
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
always being implemented consistently
 
02:36:01.130 --> 02:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
from municipality admits municipality
 
02:36:03.230 --> 02:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
with some of them not releasing the
 
02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
security deposit or not responding to
 
02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
requests or requiring
 
02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
um or requiring case in violation of the
 
02:36:13.429 --> 02:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
statute this bill would clarify the
 
02:36:15.410 --> 02:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
existing subdivision regulations which
 
02:36:17.690 --> 02:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
have been in place for about 10 years it
 
02:36:18.889 --> 02:36:18.899 align:start position:0%
would increase the allowed cost
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
escalation factor from 10 to 15 percent
 
02:36:23.929 --> 02:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
and it would require the release of a
 
02:36:26.809 --> 02:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
bond within 20 days of the time the work
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
has been completed streamlining
 
02:36:30.830 --> 02:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulations would help lower
 
02:36:32.510 --> 02:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
the time and cost of bringing new
 
02:36:34.849 --> 02:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
housing to Market without weakening the
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
security requirements requested by the
 
02:36:39.410 --> 02:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
local planning boards this bill would
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
help ensure that all communities are
 
02:36:43.250 --> 02:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
meeting the legal obligations that are
 
02:36:44.889 --> 02:36:44.899 align:start position:0%
already in place and decrease
 
02:36:47.650 --> 02:36:47.660 align:start position:0%
uncertainty for New Hampshire Builders
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
there are some folks who will follow me
 
02:36:51.770 --> 02:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
in testifying and I would defer
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions to them they're much better at
 
02:36:56.270 --> 02:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
answering them than I will be but I want
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your consideration and
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
your support and I think this is an
 
02:37:01.849 --> 02:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
important tool in New Hampshire's
 
02:37:04.130 --> 02:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
campaign to increase the supply of
 
02:37:05.929 --> 02:37:05.939 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
if there are basic questions I'm happy
 
02:37:09.410 --> 02:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
to take those
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
do we have basic questions for Senator
 
02:37:14.090 --> 02:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
Ennis thank you representative power she
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't usually do basic questions I've
 
02:37:18.530 --> 02:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
heard that thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you senator in this for taking my
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
question of course pretty simple it's my
 
02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that there's an amendment
 
02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
associated with this bill and has
 
02:37:27.540 --> 02:37:28.990 align:start position:0%
associated with this bill and has
anybody

02:37:28.990 --> 02:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
brought copies of that Amendment to the
 
02:37:33.950 --> 02:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee hard copies because we'd like
 
02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
to look at that do you not
 
02:37:37.550 --> 02:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative infantine has those I
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
will make sure you have it in a number
 
02:37:41.809 --> 02:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
of minutes if it's not already here
 
02:37:41.819 --> 02:37:43.610 align:start position:0%
of minutes if it's not already here
okay

02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:45.950 --> 02:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
02:37:47.330 --> 02:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you senator for taking
 
02:37:49.010 --> 02:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
my question good to see you again good
 
02:37:50.690 --> 02:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
to see you as well I apologize I don't
 
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
have the line number but I'm going to
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
the first bold which says and the cost
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
of remaining work yes do i it is it safe
 
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say is it safe does that
 
02:38:02.809 --> 02:38:02.819 align:start position:0%
mean relative to the cost of the entire
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
project or does that mean that the cost
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
that the entire cost can be reimbursed
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
say that again I didn't say it well
 
02:38:17.150 --> 02:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
it says in that sentences phases of the
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
portion are are completed and approved
 
02:38:20.990 --> 02:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
by the planning board correct then they
 
02:38:23.330 --> 02:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
can decide how much of that can be
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursed yes and then that Clause says
 
02:38:28.429 --> 02:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
end the cost of remaining work yes does
 
02:38:30.889 --> 02:38:30.899 align:start position:0%
that mean that the cost for remaining
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
work the planning board could also
 
02:38:34.969 --> 02:38:34.979 align:start position:0%
release all of that
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
or is the cost of remaining work just
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the entire cost of the
 
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
project my interpretation was relative
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
the entire cost
 
02:38:43.439 --> 02:38:44.150 align:start position:0%
the entire cost
um

02:38:44.150 --> 02:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question okay
 
02:38:47.450 --> 02:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's what I was hoping it would be
 
02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah that must be the
 
02:38:57.530 --> 02:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:57.540 --> 02:39:06.610 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:39:06.610 --> 02:39:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:08.929 --> 02:39:08.939 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
02:39:10.730 --> 02:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
but of course
 
02:39:10.740 --> 02:39:11.929 align:start position:0%
but of course
um

02:39:11.929 --> 02:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:14.750 --> 02:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions and one has to
 
02:39:16.250 --> 02:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
do with the other part of the sentence
 
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
that representative majority was
 
02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:19.969 align:start position:0%
that representative majority was
referencing

02:39:19.969 --> 02:39:19.979 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
um the at least one time every
 
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
365 days yes on the first page of the
 
02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bill yes
 
02:39:33.170 --> 02:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
if you are in a municipality and you're
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
planning office is responsible for
 
02:39:38.050 --> 02:39:38.060 align:start position:0%
scores of developments across the city
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis
 
02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:42.530 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis
uh

02:39:42.530 --> 02:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:45.170 --> 02:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
would you think that this might impose
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
us a pretty serious amount of extra work
 
02:39:53.330 --> 02:39:53.340 align:start position:0%
for planners and and staff and planning
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
offices to to maintain some kind of
 
02:39:56.399 --> 02:39:57.429 align:start position:0%
offices to to maintain some kind of
okay

02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
relapsing calendar that every 365 days
 
02:40:04.010 --> 02:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
so and so's Bond needs to be it just
 
02:40:06.889 --> 02:40:06.899 align:start position:0%
seems pretty Byzantine to me
 
02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
um be frank uh it coming from a city
 
02:40:12.770 --> 02:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
where there are many many developments
 
02:40:15.950 --> 02:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
going on all the time that's my well
 
02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
that's my first question yeah I I think
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's a valid question and it might
 
02:40:21.290 --> 02:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
impose some additional work on
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
communities but I think it's one of
 
02:40:23.929 --> 02:40:23.939 align:start position:0%
those cases where you have to look at
 
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
the trade-offs do we want more housing
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
do we want Builders to be able to do
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
this in a way that is an onerous for
 
02:40:32.090 --> 02:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
them as well
 
02:40:34.010 --> 02:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
um and and to me it's it's a cost
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
benefit thing
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
um yes it might require some extra time
 
02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
from the communities whether it's town
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
or a city at the same time facilitating
 
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
construction to address the housing
 
02:40:48.710 --> 02:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
issues that we have I think outweighs
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
that but there are probably folks from
 
02:40:53.630 --> 02:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities who may testify who will
 
02:40:56.150 --> 02:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
be better able to quantify that than I I
 
02:40:58.010 --> 02:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
can tell you in most of my district it
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be onerous but my towns are
 
02:41:02.570 --> 02:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:04.190 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:41:09.290 --> 02:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:13.490 --> 02:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
Lebanon would have to hire more staff
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
create new systems to track these things
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
accurately under the law should this
 
02:41:20.990 --> 02:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
become law
 
02:41:24.050 --> 02:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
and that cost would be passed along to
 
02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers I can't answer that
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
question I think it would vary by
 
02:41:29.929 --> 02:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
community and how much capacity they
 
02:41:32.030 --> 02:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
have on hand presently but I don't know
 
02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
the answer to that and I think it would
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
be different from City to city and town
 
02:41:38.929 --> 02:41:38.939 align:start position:0%
to town thank you thank you
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
 
02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
majority thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:41:44.510 --> 02:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
you my question was answered in the
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendment so thank you and then I just
 
02:41:50.330 --> 02:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
want to ask in section e new section E I
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
assume or is is it correct that that
 
02:41:55.490 --> 02:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
section is added to give an enforcement
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
through the courts uh because I'm not
 
02:41:59.630 --> 02:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
sure how else the shall in there is
 
02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
enforceable or the question is how is
 
02:42:09.070 --> 02:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:11.929 --> 02:42:11.939 align:start position:0%
which line are you on represent uh it's
 
02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
it's throughout it's just okay the
 
02:42:16.910 --> 02:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
timing you shall just shall be completed
 
02:42:19.570 --> 02:42:19.580 align:start position:0%
within 20 days
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know in the ideal world we never get
 
02:42:24.050 --> 02:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
to that point right right and I don't
 
02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
think we would I mean I can't imagine a
 
02:42:28.910 --> 02:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
town saying yeah you completed the work
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
but we're not releasing it I mean that's
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
just not the way we do business yeah
 
02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's prescriptive maybe not
 
02:42:40.130 --> 02:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
punitive how's that all right
 
02:42:41.929 --> 02:42:41.939 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
much Senator thank you
 
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
next we will call Representative
 
02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:55.969 align:start position:0%
next we will call Representative
infantine

02:42:55.969 --> 02:42:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Will
 
02:43:00.710 --> 02:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
infantine I represent uh Hillsborough 16
 
02:43:04.910 --> 02:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
which is a east side of Manchester
 
02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
I serve on the Executive Board of the
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
Home Builders Association as well as
 
02:43:13.969 --> 02:43:13.979 align:start position:0%
being an insurance agent where I have
 
02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
been providing Surety bonds to people
 
02:43:18.170 --> 02:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
for the last 35 years
 
02:43:20.889 --> 02:43:20.899 align:start position:0%
so when the executive board sat down
 
02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
nine months ago trying to determine what
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
we could do to make things easier to get
 
02:43:29.809 --> 02:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
more building or housing units on the
 
02:43:31.730 --> 02:43:31.740 align:start position:0%
market this was one of the things that I
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
came up with I actually tried to present
 
02:43:35.630 --> 02:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
something to this committee eight or
 
02:43:38.410 --> 02:43:38.420 align:start position:0%
nine years ago but
 
02:43:40.969 --> 02:43:40.979 align:start position:0%
the desire to get more units on the
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
market wasn't as as um
 
02:43:47.450 --> 02:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
important as it seems to be today so I
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to explain to you I do espouse
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
the virtues of Surety
 
02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
Surety is as most of you know is a
 
02:43:57.650 --> 02:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
guarantee you've all heard about a uh um
 
02:43:59.630 --> 02:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
a bail bond it guarantees you'll show up
 
02:44:01.370 --> 02:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
we've all heard about it in the news and
 
02:44:03.230 --> 02:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
someone has to post bail there's all
 
02:44:05.570 --> 02:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that require bonds
 
02:44:09.170 --> 02:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
the point is to guarantee
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
um The public's money
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
so we post what we call Performance and
 
02:44:14.809 --> 02:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
payment bonds if you build a school you
 
02:44:16.790 --> 02:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
build a municipal building you build a
 
02:44:19.070 --> 02:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
road it has to be bonded you provide a
 
02:44:20.690 --> 02:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
performance bond to guarantee it'll be
 
02:44:22.610 --> 02:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
done as per the specifications you need
 
02:44:24.710 --> 02:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
to provide a payment Bond guaranteeing
 
02:44:26.809 --> 02:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
that all bills and will be paid because
 
02:44:28.910 --> 02:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
you can't lean a public building
 
02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
so you must post a bond to make sure the
 
02:44:33.290 --> 02:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
Public's money is secured and you get
 
02:44:35.090 --> 02:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
what you pay for
 
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
um and you protect the public money
 
02:44:39.770 --> 02:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
same thing with these bonds
 
02:44:42.290 --> 02:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
I'm going to guarantee a developer will
 
02:44:43.849 --> 02:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
guarantee they will do what they say
 
02:44:44.809 --> 02:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
they're going to do if they're going to
 
02:44:46.370 --> 02:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
have Granite curbs in that subdivision
 
02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
then they're going to have to have
 
02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
Granite curbs if they're going to have
 
02:44:50.330 --> 02:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
so and so lighting they're going to have
 
02:44:52.429 --> 02:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
to have a so and so lighting the
 
02:44:53.809 --> 02:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
municipality wants to make sure it's
 
02:44:55.429 --> 02:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
done because they don't want to have to
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
deal with if if someone goes belly up in
 
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
the middle of a project the things
 
02:45:03.770 --> 02:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
aren't done the road can't be plowed the
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
road can't have emergency services to it
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
so you post a bond I'm all in favor of
 
02:45:10.030 --> 02:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
that and have had a
 
02:45:13.250 --> 02:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
good time doing it most of my career the
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
problem is no one's really following the
 
02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:16.610 align:start position:0%
problem is no one's really following the
rules

02:45:16.610 --> 02:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the city of Concord they decide
 
02:45:19.849 --> 02:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
they're only going to reduce the amount
 
02:45:22.190 --> 02:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
of a bond once from the full amount to
 
02:45:23.389 --> 02:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
02:45:25.250 --> 02:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
that's it well that's in violation of
 
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
the law
 
02:45:27.530 --> 02:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
I have something right here in my hands
 
02:45:29.450 --> 02:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
in the town of Derry first of all Dairy
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
won't accept bonds well the law says you
 
02:45:33.290 --> 02:45:33.300 align:start position:0%
have to accept bonds
 
02:45:36.290 --> 02:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
so you have to push push get an attorney
 
02:45:37.849 --> 02:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
involved and push them
 
02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
and then when they do
 
02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
they give you
 
02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
one of these things one of your
 
02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
questions representative Travis asked
 
02:45:48.349 --> 02:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
about who has to do this almost every
 
02:45:51.410 --> 02:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
municipality uses a an engineering firm
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
to determine what the bond amount should
 
02:45:55.969 --> 02:45:55.979 align:start position:0%
be and the developer pays that and then
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
come up with a nice little form like
 
02:45:58.790 --> 02:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
this it breaks down everything from
 
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
clearing and grubbing to gravel to sand
 
02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
to erosion control to sight mitigation
 
02:46:05.450 --> 02:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
all these things and it's all written
 
02:46:08.270 --> 02:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
out here and at the end the law says you
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
can only add 10 percent to this this
 
02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
one's 28 percent
 
02:46:14.330 --> 02:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
I've seen some that are 30 or 35 percent
 
02:46:16.130 --> 02:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
that they add on to the cost for the
 
02:46:16.140 --> 02:46:17.389 align:start position:0%
that they add on to the cost for the
bonds

02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
02:46:19.010 --> 02:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
in Kingston
 
02:46:21.050 --> 02:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
I'm working on 11 months now since the
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
Project's been done and I still can't
 
02:46:24.889 --> 02:46:24.899 align:start position:0%
get the town to release the bond
 
02:46:26.809 --> 02:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
Londonderry has a bond form that's so
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
onerous no one will write on it
 
02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
they've had to amend that because
 
02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
they've been pushed back on a number of
 
02:46:34.610 --> 02:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
times so there's all kinds of goofy
 
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
things that happen Rochester is a great
 
02:46:38.929 --> 02:46:38.939 align:start position:0%
example Rochester has decided it's too
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
expensive for the developers to post
 
02:46:42.290 --> 02:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
these bonds they let everyone start
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
working go ahead do what you need to do
 
02:46:47.929 --> 02:46:47.939 align:start position:0%
cut trees get it ready get the gravel do
 
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
the asphalt but you can't sell a lot or
 
02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
you can't ask for a building permit that
 
02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
reduces the cost of the developer
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
and they get the guarantee they need
 
02:46:59.750 --> 02:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
toward the end guess what that's not
 
02:47:02.210 --> 02:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
legal right now that's not in the law
 
02:47:04.550 --> 02:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
so the idea was to kind of Corral a lot
 
02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
of these things that are being done
 
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
to make it consistent
 
02:47:10.490 --> 02:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
02:47:10.500 --> 02:47:11.389 align:start position:0%
I understand
um

02:47:11.389 --> 02:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:13.969 --> 02:47:13.979 align:start position:0%
it costs more today so be trying to be a
 
02:47:15.889 --> 02:47:15.899 align:start position:0%
little magnanimous I increased the
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
percentage allowed from 10 to 15 percent
 
02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
of the the maximum amount that the
 
02:47:25.730 --> 02:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
municipality can add as a as a a buffer
 
02:47:28.490 --> 02:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
amount so a lot of these things were
 
02:47:30.770 --> 02:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
done just to make it easier because what
 
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
really happens in real life
 
02:47:35.330 --> 02:47:35.340 align:start position:0%
a developer wants to
 
02:47:35.340 --> 02:47:35.870 align:start position:0%
a developer wants to
um

02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:38.090 --> 02:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
build a road cost three quarters of a
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
to build a miles worth of Road actually
 
02:47:43.250 --> 02:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
costs more but trying to make it easier
 
02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:44.210 align:start position:0%
costs more but trying to make it easier
here

02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:47:47.150 --> 02:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
and they have to let's say they own the
 
02:47:49.010 --> 02:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
land outright
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
it costs them they have to go to a bank
 
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
and get three quarters a million dollars
 
02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
to build the road
 
02:47:55.490 --> 02:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
then they have to post a bond if they
 
02:47:57.050 --> 02:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
can't get a bond because it's either too
 
02:47:59.870 --> 02:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
onerous or the town says well we're not
 
02:48:01.070 --> 02:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
going to accept a bond they have to go
 
02:48:03.290 --> 02:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
to the bank and get another 750 000
 
02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:04.550 align:start position:0%
to the bank and get another 750 000
alone

02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
alone
 
02:48:06.770 --> 02:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
to post for the bond
 
02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
so now every time they sell a lot and
 
02:48:10.370 --> 02:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
sell a home
 
02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
let's say they would have something
 
02:48:13.730 --> 02:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
called a lot release they have to give
 
02:48:16.849 --> 02:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
the bank a certain amount of money
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
for every lot sold say a hundred
 
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:48:22.429 --> 02:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the
 
02:48:24.290 --> 02:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
um they sell a lot they have to give the
 
02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
bank x amount of money to pay off the
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
loan for the road and x amount to pay
 
02:48:30.830 --> 02:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
off the bond
 
02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
and that money just goes in goes pays to
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
the bank so at the end of the project
 
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
the you know the bank would have three
 
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
quarters of a million dollars of the
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
developers money they could use for
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
other things and the costs associated
 
02:48:45.889 --> 02:48:45.899 align:start position:0%
with that because he has to post that
 
02:48:45.899 --> 02:48:47.510 align:start position:0%
with that because he has to post that
Bond

02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
Bond
 
02:48:49.849 --> 02:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
that's why they asked gee can we reduce
 
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
this once every 365 days or when
 
02:48:55.309 --> 02:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
something significant has been completed
 
02:48:58.130 --> 02:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
now I have written Bonds in Lebanon
 
02:49:01.730 --> 02:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
since you mentioned that every town
 
02:49:05.450 --> 02:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
has a has rules they all accept these
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
bonds they all keep a ledger of what's
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
going on they all inspect
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
many towns and cities require the roads
 
02:49:15.530 --> 02:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
to be inspected every 30 days and the
 
02:49:17.090 --> 02:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
developer has to pay the inspection fee
 
02:49:18.290 --> 02:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
even though it's done by a third party
 
02:49:21.410 --> 02:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
engineer that the town hires they know
 
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
when things are done they know when
 
02:49:25.190 --> 02:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
things are being completed and then they
 
02:49:26.630 --> 02:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
ask the engineer to do another one of
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
these little handy dandy reports that
 
02:49:29.389 --> 02:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
everybody uses
 
02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
and they can reduce that bond amount
 
02:49:34.370 --> 02:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
it reduces the penalty the liability
 
02:49:37.130 --> 02:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
that they have it reduces that loan if
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
they have an irrevocable letter of
 
02:49:41.090 --> 02:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
credit or cash that they had to post in
 
02:49:42.889 --> 02:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
order to get the bond so all these
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
things that are in here I know it's I do
 
02:49:46.730 --> 02:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
this for a living I'm trying to be fast
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
here and I've been doing this for so
 
02:49:48.479 --> 02:49:50.690 align:start position:0%
here and I've been doing this for so
long

02:49:50.690 --> 02:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.330 --> 02:49:53.340 align:start position:0%
that I know this backwards and fourth so
 
02:49:55.010 --> 02:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
I apologize if I'm trying to go through
 
02:49:56.990 --> 02:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
it too fast but all the things that were
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
done here were done to try to make
 
02:50:00.530 --> 02:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
things move faster
 
02:50:03.410 --> 02:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
because sometimes more often out they're
 
02:50:05.330 --> 02:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
not following the rules
 
02:50:07.849 --> 02:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
and it's not because they do it on
 
02:50:10.490 --> 02:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
purpose most of them when I bring up the
 
02:50:12.410 --> 02:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
RSA to I'm like oh we didn't even know
 
02:50:13.730 --> 02:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
that exists either just kind of rules
 
02:50:15.230 --> 02:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
we've used
 
02:50:18.050 --> 02:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I understand because I was alive in
 
02:50:21.050 --> 02:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
the 80s when things went bad
 
02:50:24.170 --> 02:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
and subdivisions were left uncompleted
 
02:50:26.570 --> 02:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
okay and and so Tom said I want cash I
 
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
want cash in the barrel head I want to
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
be able to call it whenever I want I'm
 
02:50:31.969 --> 02:50:31.979 align:start position:0%
going to call that cash I want to have
 
02:50:33.889 --> 02:50:33.899 align:start position:0%
it in my hand
 
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
these handy dandy things come in really
 
02:50:39.050 --> 02:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh good every once in a while because
 
02:50:41.450 --> 02:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
the bonds are predicated on these things
 
02:50:43.070 --> 02:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I've had Towns come back and say you
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
know we decided
 
02:50:45.950 --> 02:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to release your bond
 
02:50:48.050 --> 02:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
because we want guard rails over on that
 
02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
corner well that's fine and maybe the
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
guardrail should be there but you can't
 
02:50:53.929 --> 02:50:53.939 align:start position:0%
hold my bond hostage because it's not in
 
02:50:56.270 --> 02:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
the form that's not what was agreed to
 
02:50:58.730 --> 02:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
so it works good for both
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
it keeps the developers
 
02:51:03.410 --> 02:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
um doing their job the way they should
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
and also keeps the towns
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
um from doing what they need to do
 
02:51:10.250 --> 02:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry I went through that Mr
 
02:51:11.389 --> 02:51:11.399 align:start position:0%
chairman I didn't want to go through too
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
much I'm sure there'll be a number of
 
02:51:15.290 --> 02:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
questions I have been working with the
 
02:51:17.450 --> 02:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and although we
 
02:51:20.530 --> 02:51:20.540 align:start position:0%
have found some small air issues with
 
02:51:25.130 --> 02:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
my Amendment some things that we gave to
 
02:51:28.130 --> 02:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
um OLS did didn't come up out quite the
 
02:51:29.650 --> 02:51:29.660 align:start position:0%
way we wanted they're not substantial
 
02:51:32.570 --> 02:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
but there are some minor word changes
 
02:51:34.250 --> 02:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to have to make either
 
02:51:36.349 --> 02:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
way Mr chairman
 
02:51:38.330 --> 02:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
very good the good news is we won't be
 
02:51:41.389 --> 02:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
executing bills and probably until at
 
02:51:43.490 --> 02:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
least the 10th so you will have as much
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
time as you need to do what you need to
 
02:51:48.050 --> 02:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
do do we have any questions
 
02:51:50.510 --> 02:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
02:51:52.130 --> 02:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:51:52.140 --> 02:51:52.849 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

02:51:52.849 --> 02:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:55.370 --> 02:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
so just some clarifications for people
 
02:51:58.370 --> 02:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh I spent over 50 years as an engineer
 
02:52:01.010 --> 02:52:01.020 align:start position:0%
in construction but I just want to make
 
02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
sure I understand some of the reasons
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
why you're doing this the the bonds are
 
02:52:09.889 --> 02:52:09.899 align:start position:0%
paid for by the contractor the developer
 
02:52:13.490 --> 02:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
correct yes and then the municipality
 
02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
indirectly pays for that Bond through
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bid process through the award of the
 
02:52:19.849 --> 02:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
contract correct no good that's what I
 
02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that people
 
02:52:23.389 --> 02:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
understand that no it's directly related
 
02:52:25.630 --> 02:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
to the contractors
 
02:52:29.050 --> 02:52:29.060 align:start position:0%
bid process but indirectly they include
 
02:52:32.090 --> 02:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
a price for that Bond would you say yes
 
02:52:32.929 --> 02:52:32.939 align:start position:0%
or no
 
02:52:34.849 --> 02:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I do in answering
 
02:52:36.830 --> 02:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
your question declare something very
 
02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:38.389 align:start position:0%
your question declare something very
specific

02:52:38.389 --> 02:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
when the municipality wants a school
 
02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
or a road done you go out and you get
 
02:52:46.130 --> 02:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
the money you put it out to bid all the
 
02:52:47.870 --> 02:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
towns expense and you get it done and
 
02:52:49.490 --> 02:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
there's a performance and payment bond
 
02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
that is provided to guarantee those
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
things of the town
 
02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
subdivision bonds what this is about is
 
02:52:58.250 --> 02:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
totally separate this is a private thing
 
02:53:00.830 --> 02:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
between the developer and the town the
 
02:53:03.349 --> 02:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
developer has to pay for everything
 
02:53:05.450 --> 02:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
pay for the permits pay for the bond pay
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
for the construction
 
02:53:09.530 --> 02:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
and you whereas the other time you when
 
02:53:10.610 --> 02:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
you're building a school you're paying
 
02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
for all of it this thing the developer
 
02:53:14.510 --> 02:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
pays for everything the municipality
 
02:53:17.210 --> 02:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
gets the guarantee obligation
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
we're just kind of defining the rules
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
about how that transaction works but
 
02:53:23.929 --> 02:53:23.939 align:start position:0%
there's every cost Associated pretty
 
02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
much with a subdivision Bond or
 
02:53:27.769 --> 02:53:27.779 align:start position:0%
subdivision whether it's the engineering
 
02:53:29.750 --> 02:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's the inspection is all born
 
02:53:31.730 --> 02:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
on the developer
 
02:53:33.290 --> 02:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
now I'm not saying you don't have
 
02:53:36.769 --> 02:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
employees okay in the municipality
 
02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing the work obviously they
 
02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
are but that's what you know a lot of
 
02:53:42.410 --> 02:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
the the fees and permits are and the
 
02:53:44.690 --> 02:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
costs associated with with getting all
 
02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
of this approved and then selling these
 
02:53:50.769 --> 02:53:50.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:53.090 --> 02:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
representative Stevens
 
02:53:55.370 --> 02:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for taking
 
02:53:57.410 --> 02:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
another question
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear about the
 
02:54:03.469 --> 02:54:03.479 align:start position:0%
stated intent of the bill
 
02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
um Senator Innis said that this was
 
02:54:09.230 --> 02:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
about adding units of housing in a
 
02:54:11.290 --> 02:54:11.300 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
 
02:54:15.469 --> 02:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
I'm now hearing visits to make life
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
easier for developers and hold towns and
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
cities accountable and I'm not hearing
 
02:54:23.870 --> 02:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
anything in that conversation about
 
02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
affordability and I and I realize that
 
02:54:29.870 --> 02:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's not the intent of this bill but
 
02:54:33.469 --> 02:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
if but if the intent of the bill is to
 
02:54:37.370 --> 02:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
put more housing units into the market
 
02:54:40.250 --> 02:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
there is an affordability crisis
 
02:54:42.769 --> 02:54:42.779 align:start position:0%
and I I'm going to go back to Lebanon
 
02:54:46.969 --> 02:54:46.979 align:start position:0%
again we have 500 600 700 unit
 
02:54:49.610 --> 02:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
developments going up none of these
 
02:54:51.769 --> 02:54:51.779 align:start position:0%
units are affordable
 
02:54:56.389 --> 02:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh so can you can you articulate
 
02:54:58.849 --> 02:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of the bill
 
02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
is to put more housing units on the
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
market but not necessarily affordable
 
02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
housing units
 
02:55:08.450 --> 02:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
or is it to hold planning boards and
 
02:55:10.730 --> 02:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities feed to the fire in terms
 
02:55:14.450 --> 02:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
of their own regulations which is it I
 
02:55:15.769 --> 02:55:15.779 align:start position:0%
think it's a combination of all of them
 
02:55:17.870 --> 02:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
except for I can't guarantee anything
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
about affordable
 
02:55:21.710 --> 02:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
what is Affordable in each place and
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to do
 
02:55:26.389 --> 02:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
obviously the home builders wants to
 
02:55:28.070 --> 02:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
what is the goal of the Home Builders
 
02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:29.269 align:start position:0%
what is the goal of the Home Builders
Association

02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:55:31.490 --> 02:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
build build more homes put more people
 
02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
in homes okay
 
02:55:37.550 --> 02:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with this the
 
02:55:39.410 --> 02:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
analogy I used
 
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
about someone having to post a cash bond
 
02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
which some
 
02:55:44.220 --> 02:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
which some
um

02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:46.849 --> 02:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
towns still think that they can force
 
02:55:49.309 --> 02:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
and how you have to get that double loan
 
02:55:51.889 --> 02:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
all these different things that you need
 
02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:55:55.610 --> 02:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
in this 11 months someone still is
 
02:55:58.429 --> 02:55:58.439 align:start position:0%
paying me every year and it's now a
 
02:56:00.050 --> 02:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
whole nother year into it they have to
 
02:56:01.490 --> 02:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
pay me for another Bond because the
 
02:56:03.050 --> 02:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
municipality is still 11 months after
 
02:56:05.210 --> 02:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
the job's been done approved signed off
 
02:56:05.220 --> 02:56:06.410 align:start position:0%
the job's been done approved signed off
on

02:56:06.410 --> 02:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:56:08.450 --> 02:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
the the town father still won't sign off
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
on it because they just haven't gotten
 
02:56:13.250 --> 02:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
around to it all these things cost money
 
02:56:14.510 --> 02:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
um the executive director of the Home
 
02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
Builders Association is here and will
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
speak after me there's some astronomical
 
02:56:20.450 --> 02:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
number of 60 some thousand dollars per
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
home when it comes to all the permits
 
02:56:24.290 --> 02:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
all the bonding all the fees all the
 
02:56:25.910 --> 02:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
things associated with putting a home on
 
02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:26.630 align:start position:0%
things associated with putting a home on
it

02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to streamline the process
 
02:56:31.309 --> 02:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
obviously if you streamline the process
 
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to reduce the cost
 
02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's foolish
 
02:56:38.990 --> 02:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
my I have a 23 year old daughter who's a
 
02:56:41.330 --> 02:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
graduated college as a teacher
 
02:56:43.010 --> 02:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
then I'm trying to help her find she you
 
02:56:44.210 --> 02:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
know if you don't say
 
02:56:45.889 --> 02:56:45.899 align:start position:0%
find a home
 
02:56:48.530 --> 02:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
and so it's real to me as well
 
02:56:50.690 --> 02:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
as to the cost so whatever we can do
 
02:56:52.429 --> 02:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
these things go for condominium
 
02:56:54.769 --> 02:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
associations as well when someone builds
 
02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
this it's all the infrastructure bonds
 
02:56:59.450 --> 02:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
that go through it so honesty I can't
 
02:57:01.429 --> 02:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
guarantee it's going to put more
 
02:57:03.290 --> 02:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
affordable housing depending on how you
 
02:57:05.450 --> 02:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
want to Define that on the market but I
 
02:57:07.010 --> 02:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
do feel it'll streamline the process
 
02:57:10.670 --> 02:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
it'll make it cheaper and for the
 
02:57:12.349 --> 02:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
developers to be able to reduce their
 
02:57:15.050 --> 02:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
cost and yes there's a little bit of
 
02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
can't be any more honest with you
 
02:57:23.929 --> 02:57:23.939 align:start position:0%
representative representative power
 
02:57:25.550 --> 02:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
02:57:31.070 --> 02:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
I watched the the Senate hearing and my
 
02:57:34.370 --> 02:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
understanding was in part with regards
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
to that this bill addresses was that the
 
02:57:38.399 --> 02:57:39.410 align:start position:0%
to that this bill addresses was that the
point

02:57:39.410 --> 02:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
during the development at which these
 
02:57:45.290 --> 02:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
Bonds were issued so I see language in
 
02:57:47.389 --> 02:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
this amendment that that speaks to that
 
02:57:52.490 --> 02:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
on page two lines three and four it
 
02:57:54.950 --> 02:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
it states that
 
02:57:57.710 --> 02:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
their there should there will be no
 
02:58:01.910 --> 02:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
bond required prior just laying down the
 
02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of the subdivision like
 
02:58:07.550 --> 02:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
the roads as it says here utilities Etc
 
02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:08.990 align:start position:0%
the roads as it says here utilities Etc
so

02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
is that correct that a builder can in
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
can install those types of things prior
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
to having to go and apply for a bond is
 
02:58:22.610 --> 02:58:22.620 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
as the exam I will I can't answer that
 
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
in a yes or no please allow me as I
 
02:58:29.150 --> 02:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
stated briefly I explained what happens
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
in Rochester which again is illegal but
 
02:58:34.130 --> 02:58:34.140 align:start position:0%
they do it anyway and no one seems to
 
02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
mind they allow the Builder to start
 
02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
building doing everything of the
 
02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:40.130 align:start position:0%
building doing everything of the
infrastructure

02:58:40.130 --> 02:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:58:42.590 --> 02:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
prior to needing a bond however when
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
they then require a building permit or
 
02:58:47.090 --> 02:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
sell a piece of land to someone who's
 
02:58:49.309 --> 02:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
going to buy a lot there they must post
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
the bond to secure them it reduces the
 
02:58:53.210 --> 02:58:53.220 align:start position:0%
amount of the bond the cost and the cost
 
02:58:55.490 --> 02:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
of the developer they do that I'm trying
 
02:58:59.210 --> 02:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
to make it legal here it says may now if
 
02:59:01.490 --> 02:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
all the other towns if they still want
 
02:59:02.929 --> 02:59:02.939 align:start position:0%
to say no
 
02:59:06.349 --> 02:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
you don't touch a leaf on your land
 
02:59:08.330 --> 02:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
before you post a full bond for the full
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
amount so be it that's okay too
 
02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
but it allows other towns there's a
 
02:59:16.130 --> 02:59:16.140 align:start position:0%
small I wrote a bond last year up in
 
02:59:16.140 --> 02:59:18.050 align:start position:0%
small I wrote a bond last year up in
Arrow

02:59:18.050 --> 02:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
Arrow
 
02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and and they don't even require paved
 
02:59:22.309 --> 02:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
roads up an arrow they were happy with
 
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
Bank Run gravel on the road
 
02:59:27.349 --> 02:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
um and and they allowed the person to do
 
02:59:30.170 --> 02:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
everything except that final work before
 
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
they could then sell a piece of property
 
02:59:34.610 --> 02:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
so some people are doing this the point
 
02:59:36.349 --> 02:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
of that paragraph is only make it legal
 
02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
to what some people are doing anyway
 
02:59:41.870 --> 02:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
but it's not saying that every
 
02:59:46.730 --> 02:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:49.670 --> 02:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:51.410 --> 02:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative Majora you had your hand
 
02:59:51.420 --> 02:59:54.469 align:start position:0%
representative Majora you had your hand
up

02:59:54.469 --> 02:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and that was my exact
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
you just answered my question it was the
 
03:00:01.370 --> 03:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
same it was a concern actually I uh I've
 
03:00:02.210 --> 03:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
been dealing with the municipal
 
03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
Association on this and we're going back
 
03:00:04.969 --> 03:00:04.979 align:start position:0%
and forth and there was a comment
 
03:00:04.979 --> 03:00:06.650 align:start position:0%
and forth and there was a comment
yesterday

03:00:06.650 --> 03:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
03:00:07.610 --> 03:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
um you know you're just trying to
 
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate bonds no
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
no I think they're darn right necessary
 
03:00:15.530 --> 03:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
and they have to have something that
 
03:00:17.450 --> 03:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
just a different way of getting to the
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
same end
 
03:00:21.530 --> 03:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
03:00:23.090 --> 03:00:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:00:25.490 --> 03:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
taking another question from of course a
 
03:00:27.710 --> 03:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
planning board member
 
03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:28.429 align:start position:0%
planning board member
um

03:00:28.429 --> 03:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
I have a question about wording in
 
03:00:32.870 --> 03:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
section c
 
03:00:34.429 --> 03:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
yeah we look at the amendment or the
 
03:00:36.410 --> 03:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
original the amendment thank you very
 
03:00:38.750 --> 03:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
much inspections required by the
 
03:00:40.490 --> 03:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
municipality for at least not should be
 
03:00:42.170 --> 03:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
completed with 20 days of written
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
requests delivered by hand request from
 
03:00:49.370 --> 03:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:49.380 --> 03:00:54.530 align:start position:0%
 
especially

03:00:54.530 --> 03:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:54.540 --> 03:00:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:59.809 --> 03:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
as as I said when when an inspection is
 
03:00:59.819 --> 03:01:00.769 align:start position:0%
as as I said when when an inspection is
done

03:01:00.769 --> 03:01:00.779 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:01:02.809 --> 03:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
the municipality that does it with their
 
03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
own forces and Concord has their own
 
03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
people most everyone else uses it um the
 
03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:08.690 align:start position:0%
people most everyone else uses it um the
um

03:01:08.690 --> 03:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:10.790 --> 03:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh municipality they want them to
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
produce one of these these reports that
 
03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:15.230 align:start position:0%
produce one of these these reports that
show

03:01:15.230 --> 03:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
show
 
03:01:15.240 --> 03:01:16.250 align:start position:0%
show
um

03:01:16.250 --> 03:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:18.469 --> 03:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
what has been done what has been
 
03:01:18.479 --> 03:01:20.690 align:start position:0%
what has been done what has been
completed

03:01:20.690 --> 03:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
completed
 
03:01:23.870 --> 03:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
so the municipality would now
 
03:01:27.410 --> 03:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'm as I mentioned Also earlier
 
03:01:29.389 --> 03:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
um some of the things that OLS didn't
 
03:01:33.230 --> 03:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
carry over in agreements with the um
 
03:01:35.690 --> 03:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh Municipal Association we've increased
 
03:01:38.150 --> 03:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
that to 30 days just as a
 
03:01:41.450 --> 03:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to increase that
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes follow up thank you Mr chair I think
 
03:01:47.030 --> 03:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
my my question has more to do with
 
03:01:49.370 --> 03:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
from whom is the request coming oh the
 
03:01:51.469 --> 03:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
developer asked the municipality I'm
 
03:01:53.570 --> 03:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
sorry I would hope that that would be
 
03:01:57.950 --> 03:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:00.170 --> 03:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
where I can make it more clear it's it's
 
03:02:01.370 --> 03:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
difficult when you're looking at
 
03:02:03.410 --> 03:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
existing law and then you're trying to
 
03:02:05.210 --> 03:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
paste an amendment on
 
03:02:06.830 --> 03:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
um and the whole rest of the law isn't
 
03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:07.910 align:start position:0%
um and the whole rest of the law isn't
there

03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:02:11.929 --> 03:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
um so I I think it is but I'm happy to
 
03:02:13.730 --> 03:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't think Municipal Association
 
03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
would have a problem if we made it more
 
03:02:19.250 --> 03:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:02:24.290 --> 03:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative for taking another
 
03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
question so just to refresh my memory I
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
think that contractors or developers are
 
03:02:33.950 --> 03:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
when they apply for bonds they're only
 
03:02:36.769 --> 03:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
allowed typically through their bonding
 
03:02:39.530 --> 03:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
companies to have so much bond out is
 
03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
that correct and that part of the reason
 
03:02:45.170 --> 03:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
why you want to make this uh make these
 
03:02:47.630 --> 03:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
funds return to these developers is it
 
03:02:50.090 --> 03:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
so they have the cash flow that allows
 
03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
them to continue to do work since they
 
03:02:55.370 --> 03:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
only have since they have these limits
 
03:02:57.230 --> 03:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
is that correct would you say that's
 
03:02:58.849 --> 03:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
correct yes there are actually three
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
different ways you can post a bond cash
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
so obviously if you're posting half a
 
03:03:05.809 --> 03:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
million dollars in cash you want the
 
03:03:07.429 --> 03:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
municipality to reduce the bond amount
 
03:03:09.230 --> 03:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
so you can get some of your money back
 
03:03:11.809 --> 03:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
an irrevocable letter of credit from a
 
03:03:14.330 --> 03:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
financial institution so when you get it
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
reduced you tell the financial
 
03:03:16.610 --> 03:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
institution you show them the letter
 
03:03:18.110 --> 03:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
they will reduce
 
03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
um the collateral or whatever they have
 
03:03:21.290 --> 03:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
for that and number three is the surety
 
03:03:23.210 --> 03:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
bond which is based on your correct
 
03:03:25.010 --> 03:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
total capacity of a bond which is all
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
based on financial underwriting
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
um they have give you a certain amount
 
03:03:31.550 --> 03:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
of bond capacity
 
03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
and it costs a certain amount of money
 
03:03:36.590 --> 03:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
and when you reduce the bond it reduces
 
03:03:39.469 --> 03:03:39.479 align:start position:0%
your cost on that in a
 
03:03:42.050 --> 03:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
reduces your liability and allows you to
 
03:03:45.410 --> 03:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
have you know have that capacity for
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
additional bonding final follow-up so uh
 
03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
represented what you're saying to kind
 
03:03:54.110 --> 03:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
of go back to representative stavis's
 
03:03:56.170 --> 03:03:56.180 align:start position:0%
question the way this would help
 
03:03:59.450 --> 03:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
developers and our communities to get
 
03:04:01.130 --> 03:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
additional housing is because it frees
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
up their cash so they continue to do
 
03:04:05.389 --> 03:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
additional work uh additional
 
03:04:07.010 --> 03:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
development for the housing market
 
03:04:08.870 --> 03:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
correct again reduces their expense of
 
03:04:10.490 --> 03:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
the cost of the interest in borrowing
 
03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:15.769 --> 03:04:15.779 align:start position:0%
without I might add
 
03:04:17.690 --> 03:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
taking away what I feel is the security
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
needed by municipalities
 
03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you again
 
03:04:24.889 --> 03:04:24.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you again for taking
 
03:04:27.110 --> 03:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
my question in the uh in the amendment
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
on line 22 other non-construction
 
03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.150 align:start position:0%
on line 22 other non-construction
reasons

03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious if if and you would
 
03:04:36.769 --> 03:04:36.779 align:start position:0%
have the expertise here
 
03:04:39.650 --> 03:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
if those need to be articulated you know
 
03:04:44.290 --> 03:04:44.300 align:start position:0%
uh including but not limited to or
 
03:04:46.670 --> 03:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
is that okay to have that language
 
03:04:48.769 --> 03:04:48.779 align:start position:0%
because that was
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
better than what was it before I forgot
 
03:04:57.650 --> 03:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
right now as I say the law allows that
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
once you get a cost derived for what
 
03:05:07.969 --> 03:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
they feel the cost of that subdivision
 
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:10.380 align:start position:0%
is right the municipality can add 10
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
percent right
 
03:05:12.720 --> 03:05:13.389 align:start position:0%
percent right
um

03:05:13.389 --> 03:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
what over the years people have done is
 
03:05:17.690 --> 03:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
they've said well okay we're only adding
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent
 
03:05:21.050 --> 03:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
now we're adding another 15 for
 
03:05:22.969 --> 03:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
engineering another 10 for oversight
 
03:05:24.469 --> 03:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
another five percent for this actually
 
03:05:27.650 --> 03:05:27.660 align:start position:0%
you know the Bond's 145 percent of what
 
03:05:31.070 --> 03:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
the cost is going to be so I was afraid
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
that if I said you can't be for
 
03:05:34.969 --> 03:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
engineering or Administration someone
 
03:05:37.969 --> 03:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
would come up with something else
 
03:05:40.429 --> 03:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
okay well we can't we can only do fit so
 
03:05:41.389 --> 03:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
and again
 
03:05:43.490 --> 03:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
I understand the way life is so probably
 
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
should be 15 that's probably a little
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
more security for the municipality but
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
don't and if I can't add engineering and
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
administrative maybe I'll come up with
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
um I don't know
 
03:05:55.490 --> 03:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
additional inspection fees or who knows
 
03:05:57.710 --> 03:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
what you know and I just didn't want
 
03:05:59.450 --> 03:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
this to
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
03:06:09.469 --> 03:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um I have
 
03:06:12.889 --> 03:06:12.899 align:start position:0%
several questions on page two
 
03:06:17.330 --> 03:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
um of the amendment uh on line three why
 
03:06:20.570 --> 03:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
couldn't the line the planning board may
 
03:06:24.349 --> 03:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
not require be changed to May required
 
03:06:27.889 --> 03:06:27.899 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't sound so negative and that
 
03:06:31.730 --> 03:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
the planning board might not require a
 
03:06:35.809 --> 03:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
bond but they may require a bond
 
03:06:35.819 --> 03:06:36.710 align:start position:0%
bond but they may require a bond
foreign

03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:06:38.990 --> 03:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think you have to go back to the
 
03:06:40.730 --> 03:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
original law that is in place
 
03:06:40.740 --> 03:06:42.370 align:start position:0%
original law that is in place
unfortunately

03:06:42.370 --> 03:06:42.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
03:06:46.849 --> 03:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:50.330 --> 03:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
you must you shall
 
03:06:52.849 --> 03:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
the the current law which we're not
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
amending says you shall
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay so this basically says you shall
 
03:06:59.870 --> 03:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
post a bond and then however the
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
municipality May at their own discretion
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
choose to do it a little differently
 
03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:05.750 align:start position:0%
choose to do it a little differently
okay

03:07:05.750 --> 03:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:07:09.830 --> 03:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
a follow-up please on line six
 
03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:11.870 align:start position:0%
a follow-up please on line six
um

03:07:11.870 --> 03:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
shall not require a bond form be used
 
03:07:17.630 --> 03:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
that is so onerous
 
03:07:21.050 --> 03:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
how do you find owners that local
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
bonding companies will not approve it
 
03:07:26.570 --> 03:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
could you give me a definition of that
 
03:07:30.349 --> 03:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
they they will put a a bond form in
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
place that has what we call
 
03:07:36.050 --> 03:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
immediate call language or forfeiture
 
03:07:36.060 --> 03:07:37.010 align:start position:0%
immediate call language or forfeiture
language

03:07:37.010 --> 03:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
so they get into an argument with a
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
developer one day and someone gets mad
 
03:07:42.769 --> 03:07:42.779 align:start position:0%
I'm calling the bond the bond says you
 
03:07:45.110 --> 03:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
will pay cash within 24 hours by
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
certified check into our accounts
 
03:07:51.650 --> 03:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
that is not the concept of Surety ship
 
03:07:54.469 --> 03:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
you post a bond you call the bond if you
 
03:07:56.450 --> 03:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
don't like what's going on okay the
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
municipality has the right to do that
 
03:08:00.349 --> 03:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
Bonding Company usually has 30 days to
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
go in Meet see the job see what's going
 
03:08:05.570 --> 03:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
on if the developers broke Bonding
 
03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
Company steps in and finishes it if
 
03:08:10.490 --> 03:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
they're into a a an angry conversation
 
03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
that people are angry with each other
 
03:08:14.090 --> 03:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
all right everyone this is serious stuff
 
03:08:15.530 --> 03:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
you just call this bond this is a
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
legally binding contract why don't you
 
03:08:19.790 --> 03:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
settle this out and get it done
 
03:08:24.290 --> 03:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
but these these these um I've seen it um
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
they put in these things that no one in
 
03:08:27.889 --> 03:08:27.899 align:start position:0%
their no body company in the country
 
03:08:32.769 --> 03:08:32.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:37.370 --> 03:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thanks
 
03:08:43.969 --> 03:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
try and clear up something that a lot of
 
03:08:47.870 --> 03:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:47.880 --> 03:08:49.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:08:49.730 --> 03:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:49.740 --> 03:08:51.769 align:start position:0%
um
what

03:08:51.769 --> 03:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:08:54.889 --> 03:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
if you can't get a bond
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
fill the roads and the utilities that
 
03:08:58.910 --> 03:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
have been in
 
03:09:03.170 --> 03:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh installed and so forth
 
03:09:03.180 --> 03:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
uh installed and so forth
um

03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:07.790 --> 03:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
the development goes on
 
03:09:10.610 --> 03:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
and the roads don't hold up to the
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
construction equipment that's going
 
03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
across it
 
03:09:14.160 --> 03:09:16.130 align:start position:0%
across it
now

03:09:16.130 --> 03:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:09:18.410 --> 03:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
if they've built it
 
03:09:20.809 --> 03:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
who who's going to end up paying for
 
03:09:22.610 --> 03:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayers
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
to fix our own
 
03:09:27.230 --> 03:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
um what ends up happening uh
 
03:09:27.240 --> 03:09:28.309 align:start position:0%
um what ends up happening uh
realistically

03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:09:32.750 --> 03:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
um use your example
 
03:09:35.090 --> 03:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
the bonding company or the municipality
 
03:09:37.610 --> 03:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
says You must Bond 100 of it up front
 
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
so they post a bond for 100 of it every
 
03:09:41.690 --> 03:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
time something gets done there's
 
03:09:43.370 --> 03:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
inspection requirements whether it's the
 
03:09:45.230 --> 03:09:45.240 align:start position:0%
gravels the compaction certain amount of
 
03:09:47.090 --> 03:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
asphalt asphalt has to be tested to make
 
03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
sure it meets a certain whatever right
 
03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
most municipalities will not allow the
 
03:09:53.690 --> 03:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
final course of asphalt until all of the
 
03:09:55.610 --> 03:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
work is done all the homes are built so
 
03:09:57.170 --> 03:09:57.180 align:start position:0%
there's no construction equipment going
 
03:09:57.180 --> 03:09:58.670 align:start position:0%
there's no construction equipment going
on

03:09:58.670 --> 03:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:10:00.170 --> 03:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
then you're allowed to put the final
 
03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
coat of asphalt down then you have to do
 
03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
the final landscaping and then
 
03:10:05.330 --> 03:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities require what's called a
 
03:10:07.309 --> 03:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
10 maintenance Bond on every single
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
project every single subdivision and for
 
03:10:12.170 --> 03:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
up to one year a bond of ten percent of
 
03:10:14.690 --> 03:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
the amount of the project must be put in
 
03:10:16.730 --> 03:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
place and the municipality has at least
 
03:10:19.969 --> 03:10:19.979 align:start position:0%
one more year then to call that Bond or
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
to tell them to fix it fix the
 
03:10:23.809 --> 03:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
Landscaping that that didn't the trees
 
03:10:26.570 --> 03:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
it didn't take or the the wash away a
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
rut that was caused by a heavy rain and
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
if that road doesn't hold up again
 
03:10:32.269 --> 03:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
that's what that maintenance spawned for
 
03:10:34.849 --> 03:10:34.859 align:start position:0%
but municipalities you know pretty smart
 
03:10:37.610 --> 03:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
and and everyone kind of follows the dot
 
03:10:40.070 --> 03:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
rules for building roads you know you
 
03:10:42.290 --> 03:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
can't lay asphalt unless it's 40 degrees
 
03:10:44.330 --> 03:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
and rising and all the other stuff
 
03:10:46.490 --> 03:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
which is why most municipalities will
 
03:10:48.830 --> 03:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
make you wait 18 months could go through
 
03:10:50.690 --> 03:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
at least one winter before you lay the
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
final coat of asphalt because they want
 
03:10:54.170 --> 03:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
to see what happens because if the base
 
03:10:55.610 --> 03:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
coat doesn't hold up they're not going
 
03:10:57.469 --> 03:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
to let you put the final course on so
 
03:10:58.670 --> 03:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
the goal
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative is to have everything
 
03:11:02.269 --> 03:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
okay before you put the final course of
 
03:11:04.370 --> 03:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
asphalt you have one year maintenance
 
03:11:06.769 --> 03:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
guarantee and a bond and then hopefully
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
those roads will last 20 years but yes
 
03:11:10.969 --> 03:11:10.979 align:start position:0%
eventually like every Road in every town
 
03:11:13.130 --> 03:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
will eventually be have to be repaved
 
03:11:16.490 --> 03:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
after 20 or or so years
 
03:11:18.349 --> 03:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
that's just the way it is now I'm not
 
03:11:20.269 --> 03:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
changing anything follow up please go
 
03:11:20.279 --> 03:11:22.010 align:start position:0%
changing anything follow up please go
ahead

03:11:22.010 --> 03:11:22.020 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
03:11:22.020 --> 03:11:23.150 align:start position:0%
ahead
um

03:11:23.150 --> 03:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:26.450 --> 03:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my point I unless I'm
 
03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
reading this differently you're not
 
03:11:31.070 --> 03:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
03:11:37.070 --> 03:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh require a bond for the infrastructure
 
03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:38.389 align:start position:0%
uh require a bond for the infrastructure
and

03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
if it all goes
 
03:11:44.030 --> 03:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
a couple a week after the first winter
 
03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
and they go oh well
 
03:11:50.929 --> 03:11:50.939 align:start position:0%
you know what who's left out to hang
 
03:11:54.050 --> 03:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
that is not whether I just I will
 
03:11:55.969 --> 03:11:55.979 align:start position:0%
politely disagree with you
 
03:11:57.530 --> 03:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
um that's not what the bond does I mean
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
the the bill does the current law states
 
03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
that you must
 
03:12:05.870 --> 03:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
shall post a bond
 
03:12:10.849 --> 03:12:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:13.610 --> 03:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
that Miss Ali May then asked to post a
 
03:12:13.620 --> 03:12:14.450 align:start position:0%
that Miss Ali May then asked to post a
bond

03:12:14.450 --> 03:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
bond
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
after a significant amount of work has
 
03:12:18.650 --> 03:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
been done
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
before you either sell the land
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
or ask for a building permit that does
 
03:12:26.349 --> 03:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
not in any way shape or form reduce the
 
03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
municipality's requirements that they
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
that the roads the construction up to
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
that time period be inspected nothing
 
03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:34.730 align:start position:0%
that time period be inspected nothing
changes

03:12:34.730 --> 03:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:12:36.590 --> 03:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
they still have to have it inspected it
 
03:12:39.230 --> 03:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
still has to be approved and then the
 
03:12:40.849 --> 03:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
bond has to be put in place for that
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
remaining amount and if it fails that
 
03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
remaining amount of the bond is
 
03:12:47.269 --> 03:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
available to do that
 
03:12:50.050 --> 03:12:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:52.610 --> 03:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
representative Edward
 
03:12:54.650 --> 03:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
nice to see you today sir
 
03:13:00.610 --> 03:13:00.620 align:start position:0%
um on line
 
03:13:06.410 --> 03:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
of the amendment to SB 78.
 
03:13:08.889 --> 03:13:08.899 align:start position:0%
um do you happen to know if the term
 
03:13:12.190 --> 03:13:12.200 align:start position:0%
substantial improvements is
 
03:13:16.030 --> 03:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
statutorily defined somewhere else in
 
03:13:19.070 --> 03:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
674. I
 
03:13:20.690 --> 03:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
I've read that I think in the
 
03:13:22.370 --> 03:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulations but I can't
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
remember if they have a definition of
 
03:13:29.090 --> 03:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:32.030 --> 03:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
I am
 
03:13:33.710 --> 03:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
I'm remiss because I don't have the
 
03:13:35.870 --> 03:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
original Law 674 in front of me right
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
now right I just I believe it's in there
 
03:13:38.880 --> 03:13:39.530 align:start position:0%
now right I just I believe it's in there
um

03:13:39.530 --> 03:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:45.590 --> 03:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:48.290 --> 03:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
intelligent people need to agree uh
 
03:13:49.790 --> 03:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing five thousand dollars worth
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
of work is not substantial
 
03:13:54.769 --> 03:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
finishing all the clearing and grubbing
 
03:13:57.050 --> 03:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
and putting all the gravels in is a
 
03:13:58.969 --> 03:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of work
 
03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
I I don't you know I I guess I could
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
Define it for you for more than 10
 
03:14:04.550 --> 03:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
percent of the project
 
03:14:06.530 --> 03:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to do that
 
03:14:06.540 --> 03:14:07.070 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to do that
um

03:14:07.070 --> 03:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:09.230 --> 03:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
you know usually cooler heads prevail
 
03:14:10.550 --> 03:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
someone says Hey I want an inspection
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
well we just did one like 30 days ago
 
03:14:14.450 --> 03:14:14.460 align:start position:0%
and you really didn't do much so no
 
03:14:16.610 --> 03:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it
 
03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:17.570 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it
um

03:14:17.570 --> 03:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:20.929 --> 03:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
my goal was not to make the original law
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
has has kind of worked for a number of
 
03:14:24.590 --> 03:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
years other than a few tweaks around the
 
03:14:26.210 --> 03:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
edges I don't want to make it so
 
03:14:28.010 --> 03:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
litigious that I start adding all these
 
03:14:29.809 --> 03:14:29.819 align:start position:0%
things that someone's gonna
 
03:14:32.450 --> 03:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
start throwing in and well substantial
 
03:14:34.130 --> 03:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
means more than 10 percent
 
03:14:36.889 --> 03:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do it uh it's from my
 
03:14:36.899 --> 03:14:38.090 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do it uh it's from my
knowledge

03:14:38.090 --> 03:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
03:14:40.250 --> 03:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
the engineers and and the contractors
 
03:14:42.650 --> 03:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
know when substantial is and they've
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
always been able to agree uh but I'm
 
03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
happy to do that
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
03:14:55.670 --> 03:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Tatro could you thank you
 
03:14:56.990 --> 03:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:14:59.090 --> 03:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
seeing none representative I have just a
 
03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:01.130 align:start position:0%
seeing none representative I have just a
couple

03:15:01.130 --> 03:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
couple
 
03:15:02.690 --> 03:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
 
03:15:02.700 --> 03:15:06.110 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned
the

03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:09.410 --> 03:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
that towns and cities now do not abide
 
03:15:12.230 --> 03:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
by the current irsas what is the current
 
03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:14.030 align:start position:0%
by the current irsas what is the current
remedy

03:15:14.030 --> 03:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
remedy
 
03:15:16.670 --> 03:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
that the towns have on that
 
03:15:20.330 --> 03:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
other than lawsuits so it's lost in
 
03:15:23.210 --> 03:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
Derry it was a uh a motion for summary
 
03:15:25.969 --> 03:15:25.979 align:start position:0%
judgment written by an attorney
 
03:15:28.010 --> 03:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
and the town said yeah okay you're right
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
we'll accept the bond even though they
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
hadn't done it for 10 years I mean no
 
03:15:33.530 --> 03:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
one wants to do that you haven't seen it
 
03:15:36.170 --> 03:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
the construction in New Hampshire we
 
03:15:38.210 --> 03:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
have eight or nine months that's it you
 
03:15:39.650 --> 03:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
have to do infrastructure in that that
 
03:15:41.090 --> 03:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
and you go to court you lose an entire
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
season and that's just more costs
 
03:15:46.190 --> 03:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
associated with carrying costs of where
 
03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
everything else so nobody wants to get
 
03:15:50.330 --> 03:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
into an argument with the municipality
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
because it's a no-win situation with our
 
03:15:52.439 --> 03:15:54.410 align:start position:0%
because it's a no-win situation with our
seasons

03:15:54.410 --> 03:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
seasons
 
03:15:56.570 --> 03:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
totally understand which brings me to my
 
03:15:58.670 --> 03:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
next question do you believe the changes
 
03:16:00.650 --> 03:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
that you're proposing in here will that
 
03:16:07.630 --> 03:16:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
I think it'll make it more clear for
 
03:16:13.370 --> 03:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
them I every time like when I had to get
 
03:16:15.050 --> 03:16:15.060 align:start position:0%
involved with concord
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
I talked to the attorney in Concord and
 
03:16:18.889 --> 03:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
he said well I'm sorry well I mean I'm
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
reading the law too but these are the
 
03:16:22.429 --> 03:16:22.439 align:start position:0%
rules we're given so I call the mayor of
 
03:16:23.809 --> 03:16:23.819 align:start position:0%
Concord and
 
03:16:25.490 --> 03:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
talked to him for 10 minutes he goes yep
 
03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay I'll get back to you and sure
 
03:16:28.010 --> 03:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
enough the next day is like follow the
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
law please you know and and dairy and
 
03:16:33.170 --> 03:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
and they kind of came around and and in
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
Kingston who kind of put this and said
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know come on guys do you have a time
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
period you got to do this
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
um and usually they come around no one
 
03:16:44.389 --> 03:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
purposely does this everyone's you know
 
03:16:45.769 --> 03:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
they have their own rules and
 
03:16:47.210 --> 03:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
regulations that they're following in
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
their town no one ever pulls out 674
 
03:16:51.950 --> 03:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
during the day to compare and contrast
 
03:16:53.690 --> 03:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
their rules
 
03:16:55.969 --> 03:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
so it's nice to have something that and
 
03:16:58.250 --> 03:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly every time I do push
 
03:17:00.050 --> 03:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
the issue everyone's pretty good about
 
03:17:04.070 --> 03:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
it you know they okay sorry didn't know
 
03:17:08.710 --> 03:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.690 --> 03:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
so will this stop them from violating do
 
03:17:13.969 --> 03:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
you think or just simply yes I think it
 
03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
gives them a better road map to be able
 
03:17:18.469 --> 03:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
to to do it because like everything else
 
03:17:20.330 --> 03:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
everything is evolving
 
03:17:22.490 --> 03:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
okay our society has evolved since the
 
03:17:23.929 --> 03:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
80s when they put these things in place
 
03:17:26.210 --> 03:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
construction is faster it's quicker it's
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
more you know using less men more
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
machines you know we used to do it with
 
03:17:32.630 --> 03:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
a you know a Transit you know now you're
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
doing with GPS to make things levels so
 
03:17:36.110 --> 03:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
many things are happening so much faster
 
03:17:38.090 --> 03:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
that you know it's okay every 20 years
 
03:17:39.650 --> 03:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
to update
 
03:17:39.660 --> 03:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
to update
understood

03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
understood
 
03:17:42.590 --> 03:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
two more
 
03:17:45.650 --> 03:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
um what what do you see as a potential
 
03:17:48.170 --> 03:17:48.180 align:start position:0%
downside risks to the changes do you see
 
03:17:48.180 --> 03:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
downside risks to the changes do you see
any

03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:56.929 --> 03:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
to be honest I tried to look at it
 
03:17:58.969 --> 03:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
from every different direction
 
03:18:01.309 --> 03:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
I looked at it from the Home Builders
 
03:18:03.650 --> 03:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
Association that wanted no bonds I said
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
no that's not going to work I wanted to
 
03:18:07.730 --> 03:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
take it from my standpoint I wanted to
 
03:18:09.349 --> 03:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
do my job easier I wanted to do it from
 
03:18:10.849 --> 03:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
trying to help the develop but not give
 
03:18:12.110 --> 03:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
the developer too much because you know
 
03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
what happens if you give a developer for
 
03:18:15.650 --> 03:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
too much they take give them an
 
03:18:17.809 --> 03:18:17.819 align:start position:0%
instantly take a yard type thing so I
 
03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
really tried to that's why I increased
 
03:18:22.910 --> 03:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
the percentage to 15 I I try to do my
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
best to make it even for everybody so I
 
03:18:26.750 --> 03:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
don't really see any downside here if
 
03:18:28.190 --> 03:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
anything I make a few more people that
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
are doing things illegally right now
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
legal but no I don't representative I
 
03:18:32.880 --> 03:18:34.429 align:start position:0%
legal but no I don't representative I
don't

03:18:34.429 --> 03:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:18:37.370 --> 03:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh last one is more of a language
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
structure issue if you and maybe nature
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
whoever's going to be redrafting
 
03:18:44.210 --> 03:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
whatever you guys redraft
 
03:18:47.990 --> 03:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at uh page one
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
the last line of that paragraph says the
 
03:18:54.650 --> 03:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
regulations or practice of the planning
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
board and then you have a b and c that
 
03:19:00.650 --> 03:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
say may shall May then you go over to
 
03:19:02.090 --> 03:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
the second page
 
03:19:06.050 --> 03:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
d and e do not follow the language
 
03:19:08.330 --> 03:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
structure those probably should be
 
03:19:10.130 --> 03:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
separate items because if you actually
 
03:19:12.170 --> 03:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
read it the regulations or practice of
 
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
the planning board the planning board
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
limitations under this paragraph it just
 
03:19:20.090 --> 03:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't flow correctly so
 
03:19:22.130 --> 03:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you make DNE separate
 
03:19:23.870 --> 03:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
paragraphs or whatever but
 
03:19:27.050 --> 03:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
yes valid point we'll try to make some
 
03:19:29.210 --> 03:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
changes okay
 
03:19:32.690 --> 03:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
um one final one the reason on uh the
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
second page for eliminating the section
 
03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
about uh fire suppression what was the
 
03:19:41.929 --> 03:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
because it's already illegal I'm going
 
03:19:45.290 --> 03:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
to let
 
03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:48.830 align:start position:0%
to let
um

03:19:48.830 --> 03:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:51.050 --> 03:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Clegg
 
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
who was involved with developing that
 
03:19:55.550 --> 03:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
law answer that question that's fine
 
03:19:56.750 --> 03:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
no more questions thank you very much
 
03:19:58.080 --> 03:19:59.269 align:start position:0%
no more questions thank you very much
representative

03:19:59.269 --> 03:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry to give you a goofy
 
03:20:04.849 --> 03:20:04.859 align:start position:0%
tutorial on Surety I apologize if it was
 
03:20:08.330 --> 03:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:10.610 --> 03:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
next we do have represent uh Robert
 
03:20:10.620 --> 03:20:16.429 align:start position:0%
next we do have represent uh Robert
kleich

03:20:16.429 --> 03:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:20.330 --> 03:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you and just just to be clear
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
um we are kind of working off what you
 
03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
kind of are proposing as an amendment
 
03:20:28.429 --> 03:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
and not that first part yet we
 
03:20:30.410 --> 03:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
anticipate there's going to be further
 
03:20:33.650 --> 03:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
work done correct correct okay very good
 
03:20:36.170 --> 03:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead for the record I'm Robert clay
 
03:20:38.050 --> 03:20:38.060 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the home builders
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
I am a developer and I wish you'd give
 
03:20:43.190 --> 03:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
me an inch will because I take three
 
03:20:45.410 --> 03:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
inches not the yard but
 
03:20:47.809 --> 03:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
um I just want you to know that I'm part
 
03:20:50.210 --> 03:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
of the reason why you see what you see I
 
03:20:52.849 --> 03:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
have an a development right now with
 
03:20:55.250 --> 03:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
four lots that I can't even register
 
03:20:57.950 --> 03:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
unless I post a 96 000 Bond because
 
03:21:00.290 --> 03:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
that's what the city engineer wants
 
03:21:03.650 --> 03:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
so that 96 000 just so you know goes
 
03:21:06.469 --> 03:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
towards every single lot and it's why we
 
03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
have no longer the ability to make of
 
03:21:10.670 --> 03:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
affordable housing we don't even call it
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing anymore we call it
 
03:21:12.120 --> 03:21:13.490 align:start position:0%
affordable housing anymore we call it
attainable

03:21:13.490 --> 03:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
attainable
 
03:21:16.969 --> 03:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
I used to sell a house for 350 000 in
 
03:21:20.269 --> 03:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
2020 that I can't even build today
 
03:21:23.570 --> 03:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
for 350 000. so we have to figure out
 
03:21:25.250 --> 03:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
where to go and how to make things go
 
03:21:27.410 --> 03:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
this is one of the things when we talk
 
03:21:29.750 --> 03:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
about putting in the infrastructure
 
03:21:32.630 --> 03:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it says in here once I asked for a
 
03:21:33.710 --> 03:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
building permit where somebody's
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
actually going to live I have to pull
 
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
the bomb and I don't have a problem with
 
03:21:39.170 --> 03:21:39.180 align:start position:0%
that but in the meantime I still have to
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
get permits to put in my sewer my water
 
03:21:43.849 --> 03:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
and I have to have inspections before I
 
03:21:46.190 --> 03:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
can bury it so I'm not doing anything
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
that isn't already seen I'm not causing
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
any more problems for the local building
 
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
inspectors because they have to do that
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
anyways I'm just saving some money
 
03:21:57.230 --> 03:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
even if it's a cash a bond like
 
03:21:59.090 --> 03:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
Nashville requires cash
 
03:22:01.070 --> 03:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
that's money that's sitting there that I
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
can't use
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
to make things work so if I have to
 
03:22:06.650 --> 03:22:06.660 align:start position:0%
borrow money and it's ten percent or
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
seven percent I add it to the price of
 
03:22:11.750 --> 03:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
the house I mean we're in business
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
so this would allow me to put in all my
 
03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it would also allow me to
 
03:22:18.590 --> 03:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
put down my first coat of Paving my
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
first coat of Paving as well infantein
 
03:22:23.090 --> 03:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
said is what we call the binder and it's
 
03:22:24.710 --> 03:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
there forever but I have to have it
 
03:22:26.269 --> 03:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
inspected I have to have the gravel and
 
03:22:27.889 --> 03:22:27.899 align:start position:0%
everything else inspected before I can
 
03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually put the pavement down so I
 
03:22:32.090 --> 03:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't lost anything the
 
03:22:34.490 --> 03:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
community hasn't lost anything all the
 
03:22:36.650 --> 03:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
inspections are the same there's just no
 
03:22:38.510 --> 03:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
money sitting in a bank someplace that I
 
03:22:39.950 --> 03:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
can't use
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
when we look at the inspections required
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
by the municipality for release of a
 
03:22:43.680 --> 03:22:44.570 align:start position:0%
by the municipality for release of a
bond

03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
bond
 
03:22:46.969 --> 03:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
the idea is that
 
03:22:50.090 --> 03:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
if the municipality says these are the
 
03:22:51.650 --> 03:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
inspections you have to have and there
 
03:22:54.349 --> 03:22:54.359 align:start position:0%
is some changes someplace
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
um then I have to notify them
 
03:22:58.370 --> 03:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
I can't just sit there and say well you
 
03:22:59.570 --> 03:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
never showed up
 
03:23:01.730 --> 03:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
I have to notify them and when I say
 
03:23:04.429 --> 03:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
that you sit there and not show up
 
03:23:06.590 --> 03:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
um septic systems is a good example if
 
03:23:08.330 --> 03:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
you're building a septic system and you
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
call them and they don't show you just
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
bury it so this says you have to you
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
have to call them you have to give them
 
03:23:16.729 --> 03:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
so many days I guess we're going to
 
03:23:18.889 --> 03:23:18.899 align:start position:0%
change it to 30 business days and you
 
03:23:21.050 --> 03:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
have to give it in writing or by hand so
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's no question that you asked for
 
03:23:25.370 --> 03:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
it and no question that they didn't know
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we're actually trying to give
 
03:23:29.690 --> 03:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
something back to the communities and
 
03:23:31.630 --> 03:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
not take it away
 
03:23:34.610 --> 03:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
the other question is is um
 
03:23:36.410 --> 03:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
in the second part somebody asked the
 
03:23:39.170 --> 03:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
question about the municipality shown
 
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
spec for completion of work cited as
 
03:23:43.150 --> 03:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
incomplete or non-compliant
 
03:23:45.889 --> 03:23:45.899 align:start position:0%
within 10 business days of written
 
03:23:45.899 --> 03:23:46.910 align:start position:0%
within 10 business days of written
notification

03:23:46.910 --> 03:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
notification
 
03:23:49.309 --> 03:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
the problem or the reason there is that
 
03:23:51.710 --> 03:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
if I miss something I'm not talking
 
03:23:53.090 --> 03:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
about anything that went on the ground
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
but let's say that I said I was going to
 
03:23:57.050 --> 03:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
put in 10 trees and there were only
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
eight it doesn't take much to come down
 
03:24:01.250 --> 03:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
and see that there's two more trees put
 
03:24:03.469 --> 03:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
in or maybe I didn't put in the bounds
 
03:24:06.050 --> 03:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
so I have to do all that there are small
 
03:24:07.610 --> 03:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
things that shouldn't take a lot of time
 
03:24:09.410 --> 03:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's oops you didn't do something
 
03:24:11.450 --> 03:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
somebody comes down it shouldn't take
 
03:24:13.849 --> 03:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
you more than 10 or 15 minutes so that's
 
03:24:16.729 --> 03:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
why we put in the short notice
 
03:24:16.739 --> 03:24:18.050 align:start position:0%
why we put in the short notice
um

03:24:18.050 --> 03:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:20.809 --> 03:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
someone asked what happens when the
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
cities of towns ask for stuff that it's
 
03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
not legal
 
03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's a thing that says go along the
 
03:24:29.570 --> 03:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
get along so I have cash bonds out there
 
03:24:32.450 --> 03:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
because certain places require it I can
 
03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
argue it
 
03:24:36.170 --> 03:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
but I'll tell you that arguing with an
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
engineer or somebody who's now going to
 
03:24:40.130 --> 03:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
inspect your work isn't real smart
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
you're better off to just go along to
 
03:24:44.570 --> 03:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
get along and that's why we came here to
 
03:24:47.090 --> 03:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
do something you know I've been a member
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
of my community for a long time as far
 
03:24:52.070 --> 03:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
as Selectmen and Council and
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
planning board and all that stuff so so
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
I get it and I and I know that we don't
 
03:24:57.650 --> 03:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
want anybody to come in and do something
 
03:24:59.809 --> 03:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
wrong that's not what this bill's trying
 
03:25:01.130 --> 03:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
to do it's trying to make everybody do
 
03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
something right together but it really
 
03:25:04.910 --> 03:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
does matter
 
03:25:07.490 --> 03:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
and and I only build affordable housing
 
03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
I only build family housing we used to
 
03:25:11.330 --> 03:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
build three family three three bedroom
 
03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
family houses with hardwood floors and
 
03:25:16.849 --> 03:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
selling for 350 and we can't and when
 
03:25:18.170 --> 03:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
you look at the people out there trying
 
03:25:19.429 --> 03:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
to trying to get a mortgage today
 
03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
mortgage is a six and a half percent to
 
03:25:24.469 --> 03:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
seven percent so if you used to qualify
 
03:25:26.450 --> 03:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
for a hundred thousand dollar house you
 
03:25:29.570 --> 03:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
only qualify for 250 000 house today and
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's a real problem so anything we can
 
03:25:35.389 --> 03:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
do to lessen the cost to the Builder
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:41.570 --> 03:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
I know you guys are hungry so I'll take
 
03:25:44.929 --> 03:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:48.530 --> 03:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
of course representative stavis
 
03:25:50.269 --> 03:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:25:51.530 --> 03:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
so does that mean
 
03:25:56.809 --> 03:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said that if your
 
03:25:58.790 --> 03:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
costs are lower you're going to pass
 
03:26:01.070 --> 03:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
those savings along to the home buyer
 
03:26:03.889 --> 03:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
absolutely we do
 
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
a representative priests
 
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:26:13.729 --> 03:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:26:13.739 --> 03:26:14.450 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:26:14.450 --> 03:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
my concern now about this because I
 
03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
as a planner I agree with what you have
 
03:26:26.210 --> 03:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
put down because I think the game rules
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been played and haven't been
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
enforced by both parties and that's been
 
03:26:35.050 --> 03:26:35.060 align:start position:0%
a concern of mine
 
03:26:38.090 --> 03:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
make the distinction between the urban
 
03:26:40.849 --> 03:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
areas that have the staff they have the
 
03:26:43.610 --> 03:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
inspectors the engineers
 
03:26:46.849 --> 03:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
to do this work versus the rural areas
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
that may have one planner
 
03:26:52.910 --> 03:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
and maybe one building inspector and
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
they maybe
 
03:26:58.150 --> 03:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
contract with an engineer
 
03:27:00.769 --> 03:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for the bigger areas
 
03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
bigger cities but for the smaller ones I
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
think this might be a burden to them
 
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't I don't see it that
 
03:27:15.170 --> 03:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
way I work in some of the smaller
 
03:27:16.610 --> 03:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
communities who don't have building
 
03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
inspectors and and don't have Engineers
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
if we're doing a big project usually the
 
03:27:24.550 --> 03:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
cost of an engineer to the community
 
03:27:27.650 --> 03:27:27.660 align:start position:0%
falls on me
 
03:27:29.690 --> 03:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
um and and when we ask for inspections
 
03:27:33.229 --> 03:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh um of anything that's in here it's
 
03:27:35.809 --> 03:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
usually done 30 days is usually more
 
03:27:37.309 --> 03:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
than enough time especially if you're
 
03:27:38.750 --> 03:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
using a contract
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
um inspector I used to represent the New
 
03:27:43.729 --> 03:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building officials and and I
 
03:27:45.530 --> 03:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
know that some of them did double duty
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
in certain towns so usually they were
 
03:27:50.990 --> 03:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
available in 10 to 15 days so I really
 
03:27:52.370 --> 03:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
don't think that the smaller towns would
 
03:27:54.410 --> 03:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
have to worry I think the only time a
 
03:27:55.729 --> 03:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
small community is going to have a
 
03:27:55.739 --> 03:27:56.570 align:start position:0%
small community is going to have a
problem

03:27:56.570 --> 03:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
is when somebody comes in to put a
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
high-rise apartment building and then
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
what normally you do and developers have
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
to pay is you hire an engineering firm
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
to work for the town side
 
03:28:12.170 --> 03:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
um and as developers we're pretty smart
 
03:28:14.030 --> 03:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
we know that we don't want to aggravate
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
the engineering cause any more
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
additional payments because we're paying
 
03:28:19.729 --> 03:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
for it so I think I think the small
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:25.130 --> 03:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
I have one Mr Clark
 
03:28:27.600 --> 03:28:29.330 align:start position:0%
I have one Mr Clark
um

03:28:29.330 --> 03:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:31.010 --> 03:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
for the most part are all the current
 
03:28:33.530 --> 03:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
requirements that you as a developer run
 
03:28:35.450 --> 03:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
into are they
 
03:28:38.269 --> 03:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
City and town regulations rules zoning
 
03:28:40.250 --> 03:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
and that kind of stuff those the issues
 
03:28:42.710 --> 03:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
that you run up against in the
 
03:28:45.410 --> 03:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
we run up against all those a few years
 
03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
ago in the legislature we passed a
 
03:28:49.010 --> 03:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide building code
 
03:28:50.870 --> 03:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
and that made it a lot easier for us
 
03:28:52.849 --> 03:28:52.859 align:start position:0%
because it was supposed to be able to go
 
03:28:55.130 --> 03:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
from Community to community and have the
 
03:28:57.229 --> 03:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
exact same regulations
 
03:28:57.239 --> 03:28:58.690 align:start position:0%
exact same regulations
so

03:28:58.690 --> 03:28:58.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:01.969 --> 03:29:01.979 align:start position:0%
I know you asked about the sentence at
 
03:29:04.370 --> 03:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
the bottom what's that you asked about
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
we took out nothing in this paragraph on
 
03:29:08.330 --> 03:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
the bottom oh the sprinkler yeah sure
 
03:29:10.010 --> 03:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
the reason why we took it out is because
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
the law actually says you can't do that
 
03:29:14.990 --> 03:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a law that says the
 
03:29:17.630 --> 03:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
communities can't do that in 155. so
 
03:29:20.330 --> 03:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
what we did was we cited 155 in the top
 
03:29:22.969 --> 03:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
and says in accordance with 153.5 I'm
 
03:29:26.030 --> 03:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
sorry Roman numeral three
 
03:29:29.389 --> 03:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
the communities can't do that and that
 
03:29:31.250 --> 03:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
was to protect I will say it's to
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
protect the Builder because I built some
 
03:29:36.290 --> 03:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
units with some houses with sprinklers
 
03:29:38.450 --> 03:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
and Liberty Mutual came in and gave me
 
03:29:40.910 --> 03:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
30 days to shut them down or I'd lose my
 
03:29:42.769 --> 03:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
insurance because they pay more and
 
03:29:44.450 --> 03:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
water damage from sprinklers than they
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
do from fires
 
03:29:47.570 --> 03:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much seeing no more
 
03:29:48.889 --> 03:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
03:29:50.690 --> 03:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
testimony uh thank you Gary Abbott
 
03:30:02.769 --> 03:30:02.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.630 --> 03:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman committee members
 
03:30:07.490 --> 03:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Gary Abbott
 
03:30:10.130 --> 03:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
I'm the Executive Vice President of the
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
03:30:14.809 --> 03:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I represent large commercial
 
03:30:17.870 --> 03:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
and Industrial contractors a little
 
03:30:20.330 --> 03:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
different than the home builders but I'm
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
here today to support Senate bill 78.
 
03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
um I probably am going to include a
 
03:30:27.650 --> 03:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
little bit answering some of the
 
03:30:27.660 --> 03:30:28.570 align:start position:0%
little bit answering some of the
questions

03:30:28.570 --> 03:30:28.580 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
I've been involved with legislation
 
03:30:34.490 --> 03:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
regarding third-party oversight that
 
03:30:36.229 --> 03:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
towns are allowed on the larger
 
03:30:39.769 --> 03:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
commercial projects for the site work
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
and the development and I think what you
 
03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
just heard a little bit of is there is
 
03:30:45.950 --> 03:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of requirements
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
that a contractor or developer have to
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
go through and agree to and those
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
third-party inspections are paid by the
 
03:30:55.370 --> 03:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
developer or contractor who does the job
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
so there already is a process on that
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
early part of any project where there's
 
03:31:04.610 --> 03:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
oversight and control and inspections I
 
03:31:06.110 --> 03:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
think the other point that was a
 
03:31:07.429 --> 03:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
question that was brought up that's very
 
03:31:09.170 --> 03:31:09.180 align:start position:0%
big to us is
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
any company or developer has a bonding
 
03:31:15.710 --> 03:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
capacity that he can get a bond for so
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's very important on this second part
 
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the release of the bond
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
and that's the whole having the town
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
release portions of the bond and not
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
having my total bonding capacity tied up
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
in any one project or multiple projects
 
03:31:34.370 --> 03:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
as a contractor or developer you want to
 
03:31:36.590 --> 03:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
do numbers of projects you don't want to
 
03:31:40.010 --> 03:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
be limited by your bonding capacity and
 
03:31:42.650 --> 03:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
that is all Financial but it's a major
 
03:31:45.530 --> 03:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
thing I think there are some this this
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill gives guidance to both the
 
03:31:52.370 --> 03:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
developer and the municipality now the
 
03:31:54.429 --> 03:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
reason I was involved with third party
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
inspections which is a different part of
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
the session is because the same kind of
 
03:32:00.050 --> 03:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
thing that's happening here
 
03:32:02.150 --> 03:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
there were towns that were going beyond
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
what was they were making rules that
 
03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily compliant with what
 
03:32:09.889 --> 03:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
made sense and the costs were getting
 
03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
awful high for any developer to
 
03:32:14.510 --> 03:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
Encompass those so we worked on language
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that was clear in the
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
statutes I see the same thing happening
 
03:32:21.950 --> 03:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
here we're trying to make sure the
 
03:32:24.650 --> 03:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
bonding routine that the municipalities
 
03:32:27.170 --> 03:32:27.180 align:start position:0%
fall at least a guideline that you have
 
03:32:29.809 --> 03:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
in the legislation so therefore there's
 
03:32:32.690 --> 03:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
not abuse on either side and the
 
03:32:34.790 --> 03:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
developer gets their bond back in a
 
03:32:37.309 --> 03:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
timely fashion I know you're working on
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment and I'm glad to hear the
 
03:32:41.809 --> 03:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
municipal Association and the home
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
builders and the sponsor Prime sponsor
 
03:32:46.190 --> 03:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
working on language because I think that
 
03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
Clarity is necessary and so far what I
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
see is I think this is progress to
 
03:32:53.690 --> 03:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
clarify it compared to what we have in
 
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
the statutes now and so I would hope the
 
03:32:58.250 --> 03:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
committee would support the Senate Bill
 
03:33:01.429 --> 03:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
78 and thank you you when I take any
 
03:33:03.650 --> 03:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may have
 
03:33:08.269 --> 03:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:11.450 --> 03:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
get off easy no questions thank you very
 
03:33:11.460 --> 03:33:13.309 align:start position:0%
get off easy no questions thank you very
much

03:33:13.309 --> 03:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
03:33:25.490 --> 03:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
members Nate Graves for the municipal
 
03:33:25.500 --> 03:33:26.990 align:start position:0%
members Nate Graves for the municipal
Association

03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
Association
um

03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:29.570 --> 03:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
has stated we are
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
we we have a compromise on uh on the
 
03:33:35.630 --> 03:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
language of the bill I do want to point
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
out one thing in that compromise to you
 
03:33:40.429 --> 03:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
that wasn't captured unfortunately by
 
03:33:43.690 --> 03:33:43.700 align:start position:0%
OLS yesterday as they were drafting this
 
03:33:46.490 --> 03:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
page two lines three through five that's
 
03:33:49.370 --> 03:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
the second sentence on page two it's
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to read a planning board may allow
 
03:33:53.929 --> 03:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
Road and utility construction to start
 
03:33:56.570 --> 03:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
without a bond however a bond for the
 
03:33:58.610 --> 03:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
infrastructure roads and utilities May
 
03:34:01.250 --> 03:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
must be in place prior to the sale of
 
03:34:02.510 --> 03:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
any parcel of land within the
 
03:34:04.130 --> 03:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
subdivision or a request for a building
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
permit for structures for human
 
03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
occupation I think that
 
03:34:08.220 --> 03:34:09.050 align:start position:0%
occupation I think that
um

03:34:09.050 --> 03:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
all right I know that three committee
 
03:34:12.170 --> 03:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
members had questions about that
 
03:34:13.790 --> 03:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
particular sentence
 
03:34:16.250 --> 03:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and we think that will work better to
 
03:34:19.370 --> 03:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
capture uh what actual practice is as
 
03:34:22.010 --> 03:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
you've heard extensively today uh the
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
statute as it exists now doesn't reflect
 
03:34:26.510 --> 03:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
what actual practice is and we'd like to
 
03:34:28.750 --> 03:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
align the statute better with practice
 
03:34:30.830 --> 03:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
and also
 
03:34:32.929 --> 03:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of a good compromise I I
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
think that no one got quite everything
 
03:34:36.769 --> 03:34:36.779 align:start position:0%
they wanted but I think we all agree
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
this is the best possible outcome
 
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that the
 
03:34:43.790 --> 03:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
committee may have representative power
 
03:34:45.650 --> 03:34:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my question
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
pertains to page two and lines six
 
03:34:54.170 --> 03:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
through seven I'm concerned that the use
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the word onerous
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
is very vague and subjective do you have
 
03:35:01.490 --> 03:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
any other suggestions as to how to
 
03:35:04.670 --> 03:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
address that concern in the language of
 
03:35:07.910 --> 03:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that's more specific
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
I do not that is
 
03:35:12.110 --> 03:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
one issue that was raised during
 
03:35:14.809 --> 03:35:14.819 align:start position:0%
discussions and that's what we
 
03:35:17.690 --> 03:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
ended up on
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
but we're we will discuss it further
 
03:35:22.610 --> 03:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
after this hearing today and get you a
 
03:35:24.769 --> 03:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
final amendment by close of business
 
03:35:30.170 --> 03:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:32.510 --> 03:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative tomorrow yes represent
 
03:35:34.729 --> 03:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
the infantine disagrees with you on that
 
03:35:36.889 --> 03:35:36.899 align:start position:0%
just so you know
 
03:35:40.969 --> 03:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:45.710 --> 03:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:48.290 --> 03:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
Mr cleghead I asked him about rules
 
03:35:50.809 --> 03:35:50.819 align:start position:0%
regulation zoning by the cities and
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
towns as you're well aware in our this
 
03:35:54.410 --> 03:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
committee we've had three bills this
 
03:35:54.420 --> 03:35:56.750 align:start position:0%
committee we've had three bills this
year

03:35:56.750 --> 03:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:00.769 --> 03:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
the four units on a single family we've
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
had the
 
03:36:02.279 --> 03:36:03.830 align:start position:0%
had the
um

03:36:03.830 --> 03:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:07.250 --> 03:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
what were the other two rent control and
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
we had another one which would have 80
 
03:36:14.809 --> 03:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
use added the adus double and each one
 
03:36:18.610 --> 03:36:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
we will We felt and it was in a very
 
03:36:27.290 --> 03:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
vast bipartisan man uh manner to be
 
03:36:30.410 --> 03:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
mandates from above
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the state down to towns so
 
03:36:36.050 --> 03:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
why or why not is this a state mandate
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
going down to the towns and cities
 
03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:47.090 align:start position:0%
going down to the towns and cities
so

03:36:47.090 --> 03:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:49.490 --> 03:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a state mandate I
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
think it's Clarity on the existing
 
03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
Surety Provisions in the statute
 
03:36:55.439 --> 03:36:56.630 align:start position:0%
Surety Provisions in the statute
um

03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:59.870 --> 03:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
one of the uh one of the issues that I
 
03:37:01.190 --> 03:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
think representative infantine
 
03:37:03.650 --> 03:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
highlighted is that uh different
 
03:37:05.630 --> 03:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
communities are
 
03:37:07.729 --> 03:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
have different regulations relating to
 
03:37:11.389 --> 03:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
sureties and there's also obviously
 
03:37:13.910 --> 03:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
industry practice which he's way more
 
03:37:15.889 --> 03:37:15.899 align:start position:0%
familiar with than I am
 
03:37:17.210 --> 03:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
um and we need to make sure that
 
03:37:19.370 --> 03:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
industry practice and kind of the local
 
03:37:22.490 --> 03:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
regulations line up under State Statute
 
03:37:24.170 --> 03:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
to ensure that everything that's being
 
03:37:27.889 --> 03:37:27.899 align:start position:0%
done is lawful because we don't want a
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
situation where we would be encouraging
 
03:37:33.950 --> 03:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuits or uh discouraging building
 
03:37:36.889 --> 03:37:36.899 align:start position:0%
because there's uh there's not Clarity
 
03:37:41.690 --> 03:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
and so that was the attempt here in
 
03:37:44.450 --> 03:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
front of you today uh is the result of
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
the discussions to provide that Clarity
 
03:37:49.070 --> 03:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we have that local
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
flexibility that we that we prize or at
 
03:37:55.010 --> 03:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
the same time really making sure our
 
03:37:57.170 --> 03:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
state statute which uh I believe is
 
03:37:57.180 --> 03:37:58.370 align:start position:0%
state statute which uh I believe is
written

03:37:58.370 --> 03:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:38:00.889 --> 03:38:00.899 align:start position:0%
um as in a response to what happened in
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
the 80s
 
03:38:05.150 --> 03:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
um lined up with uh what industry
 
03:38:06.650 --> 03:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
practices and current construction
 
03:38:08.690 --> 03:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
practice which I understand has changed
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
quite significantly since that time
 
03:38:15.250 --> 03:38:15.260 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
03:38:17.570 --> 03:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:38:19.790 --> 03:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I have no more pink cards the
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
blue sheet had two signed in in favor
 
03:38:25.010 --> 03:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
and with that we will close the hearing
 
03:38:28.250 --> 03:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
on SB 78
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.610 --> 03:38:33.620 align:start position:0%
couple minutes
 
03:38:37.070 --> 03:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
our next our next uh Committee hearing
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
is scheduled for two but we will begin
 
03:38:43.729 --> 03:38:43.739 align:start position:0%
um and we'll go at 210 how's that

04:16:51.650 --> 04:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
residential development in New Hampshire
 
04:16:51.660 --> 04:16:54.290 align:start position:0%
residential development in New Hampshire

for the record I am Senator Perkins
 
04:17:11.090 --> 04:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
quoka from the Senate District 21 city
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth and several surrounding
 
04:17:14.809 --> 04:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
communities I'm here today to introduce
 
04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
SB 47 and act establishing a commission
 
04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
to study barriers to increased density
 
04:17:22.130 --> 04:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
of residential development in New
 
04:17:22.140 --> 04:17:23.689 align:start position:0%
of residential development in New
Hampshire

04:17:23.689 --> 04:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
this commission was a continuation of a
 
04:17:28.010 --> 04:17:28.020 align:start position:0%
prior commission which meant from
 
04:17:32.210 --> 04:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
September 2019 to November 2020 but was
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
curtailed due to covet it did not have
 
04:17:37.010 --> 04:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
the chance to complete its work most
 
04:17:37.020 --> 04:17:38.650 align:start position:0%
the chance to complete its work most
importantly

04:17:38.650 --> 04:17:38.660 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
determining minimum standards for
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
residential density by considering
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
public water and sewer and other
 
04:17:47.210 --> 04:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
appropriate Alternatives accounting for
 
04:17:48.769 --> 04:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
the variability of environmental
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
conditions property tax incentives to
 
04:17:53.689 --> 04:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
promote residential development and
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
exploring the possible method of
 
04:17:56.689 --> 04:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the shared Community
 
04:17:58.370 --> 04:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility of Workforce housing
 
04:18:02.450 --> 04:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
under RSA 674 5861.
 
04:18:03.889 --> 04:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
since the time of that previous
 
04:18:06.290 --> 04:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
commission ended the housing crisis has
 
04:18:08.689 --> 04:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
grown even worse with a shortage of what
 
04:18:11.330 --> 04:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
we thought to be 20 000 units Statewide
 
04:18:14.929 --> 04:18:14.939 align:start position:0%
now increasing to be just under 24 000.
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
the Council on housing stability has
 
04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
completed a review of all state
 
04:18:19.610 --> 04:18:19.620 align:start position:0%
regulations affecting Housing
 
04:18:22.130 --> 04:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
Development and found that Des septic
 
04:18:24.769 --> 04:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
system and capacity septic system citing
 
04:18:26.809 --> 04:18:26.819 align:start position:0%
and capacity requirements are far more
 
04:18:28.370 --> 04:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
astringent than surrounding New England
 
04:18:31.250 --> 04:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
states this increases the cost of inland
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
area required to build housing in areas
 
04:18:35.330 --> 04:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
lacking in water and sewer some
 
04:18:36.889 --> 04:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
communities have found ways to tackle
 
04:18:38.150 --> 04:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
this dual housing and affordability
 
04:18:39.950 --> 04:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
crisis but there are many others who
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
have not
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
statistics from the New Hampshire zoning
 
04:18:45.110 --> 04:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
Atlas highlight the current barriers to
 
04:18:46.370 --> 04:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
Housing Development created by local
 
04:18:49.010 --> 04:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
land use regulations only 34 percent of
 
04:18:50.330 --> 04:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
residential and mixed-use Zoning
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
districts throughout the state
 
04:18:53.809 --> 04:18:53.819 align:start position:0%
representing 16 percent of the state's
 
04:18:55.550 --> 04:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
buildable area allow single-family
 
04:18:57.410 --> 04:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
housing on less than an acre
 
04:18:59.929 --> 04:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
only 28 of residential and mixed-use
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
Zoning districts representing 11 percent
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
of the state's building area allow
 
04:19:06.170 --> 04:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
duplexes on less than an acre only 38
 
04:19:07.729 --> 04:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
percent of residential and mixed-use
 
04:19:09.650 --> 04:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
Zoning districts representing 21 percent
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
of the state's buildable area allow for
 
04:19:16.030 --> 04:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
five or more family housing units on on
 
04:19:19.490 --> 04:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
Lots under two and a half acres
 
04:19:21.769 --> 04:19:21.779 align:start position:0%
layering on top of these regulations are
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
others such as parking and lot
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
requirements that affect our housing
 
04:19:27.550 --> 04:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
Supply Statewide
 
04:19:29.570 --> 04:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
it is understandable why local
 
04:19:31.610 --> 04:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
regulations can be a barrier unknowingly
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
to housing in New Hampshire and helping
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
our communities achieve their housing
 
04:19:38.210 --> 04:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
goal requires cooperation and support
 
04:19:41.150 --> 04:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
from us at the state level
 
04:19:43.010 --> 04:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
the reconstitution of this commission
 
04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
will help develop these Solutions and
 
04:19:46.610 --> 04:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
guidance so that our cities and towns
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
can provide local custom ordinances
 
04:19:51.290 --> 04:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
based on some helpful groundwork laid at
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
the committee Amendment brought on the
 
04:19:58.969 --> 04:19:58.979 align:start position:0%
Senate side was from my friends Senator
 
04:20:01.370 --> 04:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
gray and Senator Murphy to just adjust
 
04:20:05.689 --> 04:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
the membership of the committee slightly
 
04:20:08.210 --> 04:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
but other than that Senate Bill 47
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate on a Voice vote
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
so I would be happy to take any
 
04:20:12.479 --> 04:20:14.030 align:start position:0%
so I would be happy to take any
questions

04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:20:18.170 --> 04:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you questions representative power
 
04:20:19.790 --> 04:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:20:22.849 --> 04:20:22.859 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question so um my
 
04:20:25.969 --> 04:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
question pertains to if this bill were
 
04:20:28.490 --> 04:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
to become law in in light of the fact
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
04:20:33.290 --> 04:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
um a special committee
 
04:20:38.330 --> 04:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
on commissions and committees and then
 
04:20:40.849 --> 04:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
also I would just I was I'm aware of
 
04:20:44.450 --> 04:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
there is a bill Senate bill 84.
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
that was hijacked by Senator gray and it
 
04:20:51.650 --> 04:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
also has something whatever his
 
04:20:53.929 --> 04:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
amendment was it IT addresses the
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
composition of the Committees and the
 
04:21:00.650 --> 04:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
commissions so how if this were signed
 
04:21:04.130 --> 04:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
into law can you speak to how this bill
 
04:21:06.290 --> 04:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
and the the ability for it to move
 
04:21:09.050 --> 04:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
forward might be affected by either of
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
that house committee that's been stood
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
up and or
 
04:21:16.189 --> 04:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
like sustenability for in particular
 
04:21:18.110 --> 04:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you representative
 
04:21:20.150 --> 04:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
power I I can't speak to the house
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions because I don't
 
04:21:24.769 --> 04:21:24.779 align:start position:0%
um know their procedures but as far as
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
SB 84 the membership of our
 
04:21:31.070 --> 04:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
commission would be compliant regardless
 
04:21:33.710 --> 04:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
of whether SB 84 passes so I believe
 
04:21:33.720 --> 04:21:35.450 align:start position:0%
of whether SB 84 passes so I believe
that

04:21:35.450 --> 04:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:38.090 --> 04:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements there is that at
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
least half the members of the commission
 
04:21:43.130 --> 04:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
be legislators and so this is compliant
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
in that eight of the 15 members are
 
04:21:51.050 --> 04:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:21:55.309 --> 04:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question how
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
would this fit in with the special
 
04:22:07.550 --> 04:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee on Workforce housing that is
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh I assume is still meeting
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so my understanding is that um that
 
04:22:15.410 --> 04:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
special committee is composed entirely
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
of legislators and so it would be
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
different from this Commission in that
 
04:22:22.910 --> 04:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
the membership
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
here includes a lot of
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um experts on housing policy in the
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
state and so if you look back to their
 
04:22:34.130 --> 04:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
reports I actually was able to attend
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
this group a few times while it was
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
still meeting it's
 
04:22:41.809 --> 04:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
it's housing experts sort of tackling
 
04:22:44.570 --> 04:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
really technical issues
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
um that they know about from their
 
04:22:48.650 --> 04:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
professional experience I think that
 
04:22:50.809 --> 04:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
it it sort of arrives in a different
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
Lane you know than our legislators who
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
are sort of hearing about the issue and
 
04:22:56.210 --> 04:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
and thinking about other policy
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
Solutions on a different level
 
04:23:01.250 --> 04:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:03.170 --> 04:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative yokawa
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:07.250 --> 04:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm over here
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
04:23:09.840 --> 04:23:11.210 align:start position:0%
that's fine
um

04:23:11.210 --> 04:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:13.370 --> 04:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
04:23:13.380 --> 04:23:16.250 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
um

04:23:16.250 --> 04:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the
 
04:23:18.720 --> 04:23:19.370 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the
um

04:23:19.370 --> 04:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:22.010 --> 04:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
this proposed committee might
 
04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
be able to be
 
04:23:31.849 --> 04:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
utilized or help
 
04:23:34.610 --> 04:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
um that special committee on housing in
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
the house
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
um maybe identify uh
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
issues that we may not have uh
 
04:23:45.490 --> 04:23:45.500 align:start position:0%
found yet
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
representative and vice versa if you
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
were done I didn't mean to cut yeah
 
04:23:52.490 --> 04:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
um I think that they very much could
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
work in tandem I think that they're you
 
04:24:01.389 --> 04:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
know policy Solutions and and sort of
 
04:24:03.889 --> 04:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
problems that are brought to legislators
 
04:24:06.290 --> 04:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
that we are often very reliant on our
 
04:24:07.969 --> 04:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
sort of subject matter experts to help
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
us develop Solutions on and so
 
04:24:14.150 --> 04:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
um again when I attended this commission
 
04:24:16.250 --> 04:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
um before it was curtailed
 
04:24:19.130 --> 04:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
that's a place where I think problems
 
04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
that are raised in the legislature can
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
really be addressed in detail and
 
04:24:24.889 --> 04:24:24.899 align:start position:0%
um I know the special committee on
 
04:24:27.410 --> 04:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
housing is also trying to serve as a
 
04:24:29.689 --> 04:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
place to generate ideas
 
04:24:32.030 --> 04:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
um you know going forward I think that
 
04:24:33.769 --> 04:24:33.779 align:start position:0%
the work that this commission does
 
04:24:36.170 --> 04:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
really could support that goal hand in
 
04:24:36.180 --> 04:24:41.090 align:start position:0%
really could support that goal hand in
hand

04:24:41.090 --> 04:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:44.210 --> 04:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
oops there we go representative Guthrie
 
04:24:46.250 --> 04:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:24:48.429 --> 04:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
04:24:52.370 --> 04:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the group that's going to
 
04:24:55.309 --> 04:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
have the most impact on this this
 
04:24:57.290 --> 04:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
commissioner is going to have on is a
 
04:24:58.849 --> 04:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
local planus
 
04:25:00.650 --> 04:25:00.660 align:start position:0%
and I don't see anybody on this
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
commission that's going to give any
 
04:25:03.239 --> 04:25:04.370 align:start position:0%
commission that's going to give any
input

04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
input
 
04:25:07.969 --> 04:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
to local to this commission about local
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
issues because this commission is going
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
to impact on the cities and towns
 
04:25:16.250 --> 04:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
depending on what legislation they come
 
04:25:18.349 --> 04:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
come up with our rules and regulations
 
04:25:23.450 --> 04:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
so where is the uh input to this
 
04:25:26.689 --> 04:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
commission from the plant local planners
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
is it going to come from outside as
 
04:25:31.610 --> 04:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
testimony or as
 
04:25:34.189 --> 04:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
you know how you how can we change this
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
so that there's at least one planner are
 
04:25:40.729 --> 04:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
planning for a member local planning
 
04:25:43.189 --> 04:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
board member sure thank you for the
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:25:44.880 --> 04:25:45.649 align:start position:0%
question so
um

04:25:45.649 --> 04:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:47.689 --> 04:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
just to be clear I think the intent is
 
04:25:47.699 --> 04:25:48.830 align:start position:0%
just to be clear I think the intent is
that

04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:51.530 --> 04:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
this be a commission that identifies
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
Solutions so it certainly wouldn't be
 
04:25:57.050 --> 04:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
imposing anything on anybody
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
um just to sort of be clear about that
 
04:26:02.090 --> 04:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
but you know to your point everything
 
04:26:03.710 --> 04:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
that they would recommend would be
 
04:26:05.870 --> 04:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
implemented locally and so making sure
 
04:26:07.610 --> 04:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
that it's feasible locally is important
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
we do have in the in lines
 
04:26:11.159 --> 04:26:13.969 align:start position:0%
we do have in the in lines
um 21-23

04:26:13.969 --> 04:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
um 21-23
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know someone to represent planning
 
04:26:17.929 --> 04:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
interest in um that includes someone
 
04:26:19.670 --> 04:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
from the planners Association which is
 
04:26:22.729 --> 04:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
composed of local planners New Hampshire
 
04:26:24.050 --> 04:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
Association of regional planning
 
04:26:25.130 --> 04:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
commissions and the New Hampshire
 
04:26:26.929 --> 04:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association which as you know
 
04:26:30.530 --> 04:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know represents local planners so I
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that fully addresses
 
04:26:34.250 --> 04:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
your concern but it is something that
 
04:26:35.809 --> 04:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
you know we tried to address in the
 
04:26:35.819 --> 04:26:36.649 align:start position:0%
you know we tried to address in the
membership

04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
membership
 
04:26:39.530 --> 04:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
I think we're both naive if you think
 
04:26:42.410 --> 04:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
that they're not I'm going to impose any
 
04:26:44.090 --> 04:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
rules or regulations in the local
 
04:26:44.100 --> 04:26:45.290 align:start position:0%
rules or regulations in the local
communities

04:26:45.290 --> 04:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:26:48.290 --> 04:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
so I I have a problem with that and as
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
long as there's not a member on a
 
04:26:53.149 --> 04:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
commission I could not vote for it
 
04:26:56.809 --> 04:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
and if they may follow Mr chair just to
 
04:26:58.969 --> 04:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
um and I you know respectfully I just
 
04:27:00.290 --> 04:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to add I didn't respond to the
 
04:27:01.790 --> 04:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
other part of your question there
 
04:27:03.469 --> 04:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
certainly would I would think the
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity for local planners to join
 
04:27:07.610 --> 04:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
them you know to testify for their
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
meetings as well thank you very much
 
04:27:13.490 --> 04:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative priests
 
04:27:15.889 --> 04:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and and thank you
 
04:27:18.110 --> 04:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:27:21.170 --> 04:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
um this is a great effort that you're
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
undertaking how much of this was done
 
04:27:28.370 --> 04:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
prior to the onset of covet and he had
 
04:27:31.010 --> 04:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
to shut down with any of this
 
04:27:34.250 --> 04:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
yeah the commission was able to meet and
 
04:27:35.929 --> 04:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
I know a couple of the commission
 
04:27:38.210 --> 04:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
members are here and so can can speak
 
04:27:39.469 --> 04:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
more fully
 
04:27:39.479 --> 04:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
more fully
um

04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
after me but they were able to complete
 
04:27:47.450 --> 04:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
um an impressive body of work that was
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
issued in a in a sort of interim report
 
04:27:52.610 --> 04:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
at the end you know during covid but in
 
04:27:54.830 --> 04:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
that report they also mentioned that
 
04:27:56.630 --> 04:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
there were things they were charged with
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
that they were not able to complete so
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna let them sort of correct this
 
04:28:03.290 --> 04:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
but my impression was sort of they got
 
04:28:04.969 --> 04:28:04.979 align:start position:0%
to do maybe two-thirds of their work and
 
04:28:07.309 --> 04:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
not the last third
 
04:28:11.990 --> 04:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:12.000 --> 04:28:13.149 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:28:13.149 --> 04:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you so much Mr
 
04:28:18.410 --> 04:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
is would it be possible that
 
04:28:23.570 --> 04:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
when you're
 
04:28:26.149 --> 04:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
like halfway through
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
this project that you have a public
 
04:28:29.279 --> 04:28:30.769 align:start position:0%
this project that you have a public
hearing

04:28:30.769 --> 04:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:28:34.370 --> 04:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
and just solicit public input from all
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
the communities
 
04:28:38.330 --> 04:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
I think that would be very beneficial
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
and you'll you will receive a greater
 
04:28:44.809 --> 04:28:44.819 align:start position:0%
buy-in would this be possible I I would
 
04:28:47.210 --> 04:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
think so again it's um you know the
 
04:28:49.969 --> 04:28:49.979 align:start position:0%
benefit of having a commission is that
 
04:28:49.979 --> 04:28:51.050 align:start position:0%
benefit of having a commission is that
um

04:28:51.050 --> 04:28:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:54.050 --> 04:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
it includes folks who are very
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
experienced in the field and so again
 
04:28:59.689 --> 04:28:59.699 align:start position:0%
when I attended this commission prior to
 
04:29:01.250 --> 04:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
its um
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
prior to covid it you know it was
 
04:29:05.929 --> 04:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
certainly soliciting input on certain
 
04:29:08.330 --> 04:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
topics you know on a on a sort of
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
meeting agenda as it went through so
 
04:29:14.809 --> 04:29:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
04:29:21.110 --> 04:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
um I've been in several recent meetings
 
04:29:25.849 --> 04:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
in both my district and in the in the
 
04:29:29.689 --> 04:29:29.699 align:start position:0%
county delegation recently where
 
04:29:33.530 --> 04:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
local residents have spoken in regard to
 
04:29:36.410 --> 04:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
their concerns about groundwater issues
 
04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
groundwater capacity in light of the
 
04:29:41.330 --> 04:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
recent droughts that we've had I see
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
over in line 15 that you talk about
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
environmental services where they're
 
04:29:47.210 --> 04:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
designated being part of the commission
 
04:29:51.349 --> 04:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
but there seems to be a a lot of concern
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
about groundwater in particular the
 
04:29:55.910 --> 04:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
capacity in people as well as drying up
 
04:29:58.370 --> 04:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
so and people have talked to me about
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
cluster development and those types of
 
04:30:02.330 --> 04:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
things which have not been that positive
 
04:30:04.490 --> 04:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
so how are you going to address those
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
concerns I understand you're going to
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
have experts but is that something that
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
has been in the Forefront in regard to
 
04:30:11.389 --> 04:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
this discussion
 
04:30:13.250 --> 04:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question
 
04:30:13.260 --> 04:30:14.570 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question
representative

04:30:14.570 --> 04:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:17.870 --> 04:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
um all of these things go very much hand
 
04:30:19.189 --> 04:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
in hand and
 
04:30:21.110 --> 04:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
um out of
 
04:30:23.689 --> 04:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
an effort that was I think
 
04:30:23.699 --> 04:30:24.469 align:start position:0%
an effort that was I think
um

04:30:24.469 --> 04:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
in 2007 and 2008 was something called
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
the growth and development Roundtable
 
04:30:32.330 --> 04:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
and it was an attempt to make sure that
 
04:30:34.490 --> 04:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
housing and conservation were very
 
04:30:36.429 --> 04:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
closely aligned so that we were
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
developing housing in a responsible way
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
I think many of us share the goals that
 
04:30:41.819 --> 04:30:42.349 align:start position:0%
I think many of us share the goals that
um

04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
housing be very compatible with the
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
natural environment that we all enjoy
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
and so to get to your question
 
04:30:50.450 --> 04:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
specifically about groundwater you know
 
04:30:53.330 --> 04:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
the long-term supply of groundwater and
 
04:30:55.070 --> 04:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
drinking water is something that I think
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
is traditionally addressed
 
04:31:00.170 --> 04:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
um more in the environmental sphere I
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
know I'm on the long-term commission for
 
04:31:03.530 --> 04:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
drinking water over on the Seacoast and
 
04:31:05.330 --> 04:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
we're talking about sort of salination
 
04:31:07.130 --> 04:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
of groundwater supplies and sort of
 
04:31:08.870 --> 04:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
long-term conversion from Wells to
 
04:31:10.370 --> 04:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
public water
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
in my mind is only sort of helped by the
 
04:31:14.929 --> 04:31:14.939 align:start position:0%
conversation of responsible development
 
04:31:17.090 --> 04:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
and sort of identifying you know
 
04:31:19.429 --> 04:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
where in our communities is the
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for us to be seeking a
 
04:31:24.170 --> 04:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
solution to housing and where is an
 
04:31:26.090 --> 04:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
inappropriate place and I think
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
um without being thoughtful about that
 
04:31:29.040 --> 04:31:29.929 align:start position:0%
um without being thoughtful about that
um

04:31:29.929 --> 04:31:29.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:32.510 --> 04:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
many towns and cities may have
 
04:31:34.849 --> 04:31:34.859 align:start position:0%
ordinances that unintentionally
 
04:31:37.130 --> 04:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
are allowing housing on land that was
 
04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
previously undeveloped or requires you
 
04:31:41.450 --> 04:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
know sort of bigger Lots than they need
 
04:31:43.429 --> 04:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
I guess in my opinion the more a thought
 
04:31:48.110 --> 04:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
is going into this field the better
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and so allowing
 
04:31:54.469 --> 04:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
sort of Housing and particularly septic
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
requirements and sort of sewer and water
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
density requirements to be something
 
04:31:59.389 --> 04:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
that's now being discussed in
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
conjunction with housing I think just
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
kind of reflects the forward thinking
 
04:32:04.010 --> 04:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about so
 
04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
04:32:13.670 --> 04:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you senator for
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
taking a question sure
 
04:32:18.170 --> 04:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
um my town I'm sure a lot of other towns
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
work with their Regional planning
 
04:32:22.969 --> 04:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
commissions on the rewrites for master
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
planning which usually includes future
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
land use chapters do you anticipate that
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
this commission will at least explore
 
04:32:34.490 --> 04:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
grant opportunities to provide that
 
04:32:36.769 --> 04:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
information should a community say we
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
need a complete rewrite
 
04:32:42.649 --> 04:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
based on the information provided
 
04:32:44.990 --> 04:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I happen to have a bill another bill
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
that addresses that question as well but
 
04:32:52.130 --> 04:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that
 
04:32:54.170 --> 04:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
um when towns and cities do make the
 
04:32:56.570 --> 04:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
decision that they need to audit or look
 
04:32:58.729 --> 04:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
at their local regulations it's it's an
 
04:33:00.889 --> 04:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
undertaking and it's expensive
 
04:33:02.809 --> 04:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
um to have someone sort of redraft that
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
zoning so there is the housing Champions
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
program that has passed through
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
um two Senate committees and has been
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
tabled to be put in the budget that
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
would create a a municipal grant program
 
04:33:16.269 --> 04:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
to support
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
audit and rewrite of zoning regulations
 
04:33:22.369 --> 04:33:22.379 align:start position:0%
that said I think that one of the
 
04:33:24.650 --> 04:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
um Concepts that's been discussed with
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
this Commission on and off and I know I
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
was just talking to one of our speakers
 
04:33:30.650 --> 04:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
before this is
 
04:33:33.051 --> 04:33:33.061 align:start position:0%
being able to develop some model zoning
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
which would make it a lot easier for
 
04:33:36.650 --> 04:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
towns and cities to have at their
 
04:33:38.990 --> 04:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
disposal something that's drafted that
 
04:33:41.150 --> 04:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
they can kind of customize locally so
 
04:33:44.330 --> 04:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
not directly in this program perhaps but
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
you know certainly supporting that
 
04:33:45.719 --> 04:33:46.910 align:start position:0%
you know certainly supporting that
effort

04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
effort
 
04:33:50.209 --> 04:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:52.369 --> 04:33:52.379 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony we have
 
04:33:57.289 --> 04:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
five pink cards up here right now uh we
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
have another hearing coming up at
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
three o'clock so we are going to uh use
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
a three minute time limit most of you
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
have put three minutes or less
 
04:34:10.250 --> 04:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
so we will use three minutes for a time
 
04:34:13.250 --> 04:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
limit when Vice chairman Powell a
 
04:34:16.970 --> 04:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
chairwoman power puts her uh pink card
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
up that means you have a half minute to
 
04:34:22.490 --> 04:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
go so with that The Honorable Ivy van is
 
04:34:22.500 --> 04:34:37.330 align:start position:0%
go so with that The Honorable Ivy van is
next

04:34:37.330 --> 04:34:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you former
 
04:34:42.890 --> 04:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
honored colleagues it's nice to be here
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in favor of SB 47
 
04:34:49.369 --> 04:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
um I think that the thing about sp-47
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
that is crucial is the fact that it is
 
04:34:56.631 --> 04:34:56.641 align:start position:0%
intended to take on some fairly
 
04:34:58.670 --> 04:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
technical things that need to be
 
04:35:02.349 --> 04:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
addressed in order to allow
 
04:35:05.470 --> 04:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
historically appropriate
 
04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
building in New Hampshire no one wants
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
to see New Hampshire become Manhattan
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that any of the things
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
listed in this proposal are going to
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
send us there
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh the two things that I thought were
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
particularly important was the whole
 
04:35:28.010 --> 04:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
question of discussing with the
 
04:35:30.131 --> 04:35:30.141 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
their standards Des has not had a chance
 
04:35:38.410 --> 04:35:38.420 align:start position:0%
to update their their septic standards
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
and a number of years and in the
 
04:35:45.289 --> 04:35:45.299 align:start position:0%
meantime there have been quite a great
 
04:35:50.410 --> 04:35:50.420 align:start position:0%
many developments that allow for uh
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
perfectly safe and adequate often
 
04:35:56.170 --> 04:35:56.180 align:start position:0%
producing potable water
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
septic systems that are not a standard
 
04:36:03.590 --> 04:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
septic tank and giant leech field right
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
now you cannot install any of those
 
04:36:11.570 --> 04:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
systems in New Hampshire unless you also
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
build a twenty thousand dollar leach
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
field because the Des standards require
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
that leech field I've talked to a number
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
of people people recently as I'm working
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
as a consultant for the Housing
 
04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
Opportunity planning grants and so I've
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
been talking to people in small towns
 
04:36:28.859 --> 04:36:30.830 align:start position:0%
been talking to people in small towns
about

04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know what they see as issues and I
 
04:36:36.890 --> 04:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
have and this is anecdata but I've had
 
04:36:40.429 --> 04:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
more than one person tell me that they
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
had to they were going to replace their
 
04:36:45.289 --> 04:36:45.299 align:start position:0%
septic system because it had failed they
 
04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to put in a much more efficient
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
and less expensive system that is you
 
04:36:55.609 --> 04:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
know has been approved in other states
 
04:36:58.010 --> 04:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
but they can't do it here because Des
 
04:37:01.070 --> 04:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
has not yet updated their standards so
 
04:37:04.490 --> 04:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'm very interested in that piece of
 
04:37:05.929 --> 04:37:05.939 align:start position:0%
this committee I think that's crucial
 
04:37:08.750 --> 04:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing is the whole question of
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
a model ordinance a model ordinance is a
 
04:37:15.890 --> 04:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
really really useful full tool
 
04:37:20.410 --> 04:37:20.420 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire many of the towns
 
04:37:24.250 --> 04:37:24.260 align:start position:0%
are more alike than they are different
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
63 percent of New Hampshire's towns do
 
04:37:29.689 --> 04:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
not have Municipal Water and Sewer
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
and we could create a good model
 
04:37:37.609 --> 04:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
ordinance that could be calibrated to
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
those towns and this is a good way to
 
04:37:42.830 --> 04:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
get started on that
 
04:37:47.689 --> 04:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
um so in in short I think that SB 47 is
 
04:37:50.449 --> 04:37:50.459 align:start position:0%
very different from the commission that
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
is being that's being spearheaded by
 
04:37:57.289 --> 04:37:57.299 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander in that these
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
are really technical nitty-gritty fixes
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
that we need to take on in order to
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
address our housing issue which gets
 
04:38:10.730 --> 04:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
worse every minute and I'm happy to take
 
04:38:12.890 --> 04:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
any questions uh questions
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie I just have a
 
04:38:17.631 --> 04:38:17.641 align:start position:0%
quick question and I'm glad to hear you
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're working in the front
 
04:38:22.990 --> 04:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
lines on septic system doing my best
 
04:38:26.090 --> 04:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
well it seems that particularly in a
 
04:38:29.689 --> 04:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
small town like I come from Hampstead we
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
have septic systems no water but we're
 
04:38:33.949 --> 04:38:33.959 align:start position:0%
going to have water in about next four
 
04:38:36.250 --> 04:38:36.260 align:start position:0%
or five years it's coming down
 
04:38:40.849 --> 04:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
into our towns so my question is do you
 
04:38:45.070 --> 04:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
know when you'll be able to have that
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
rewriting or whatever has to happen on
 
04:38:51.830 --> 04:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
this septic system so that we can have a
 
04:38:57.289 --> 04:38:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:00.529 --> 04:39:00.539 align:start position:0%
uh requirements well what has to happen
 
04:39:02.631 --> 04:39:02.641 align:start position:0%
is that the Department of Environmental
 
04:39:05.470 --> 04:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
Services has to address has to
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate their standards and what we
 
04:39:10.849 --> 04:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
would what I would expect would come out
 
04:39:12.470 --> 04:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
of this this
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
um commit committee is um a list of
 
04:39:19.310 --> 04:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
proposed changes
 
04:39:22.269 --> 04:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
um I know that the EPA has produced
 
04:39:25.250 --> 04:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
documentation on small systems for small
 
04:39:27.410 --> 04:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
towns that were essentially originally
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
developed for the colonias on the Mexico
 
04:39:33.709 --> 04:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
Texas border so they're small systems
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
that are suitable for small
 
04:39:37.730 --> 04:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods so that would be one thing
 
04:39:39.288 --> 04:39:39.298 align:start position:0%
that would be on the list the Fuji
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
system which I mentioned earlier so what
 
04:39:44.830 --> 04:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
this commission would do is say okay
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
here are some other systems that have
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
worked in other places we need the Des
 
04:39:56.630 --> 04:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to take a look at these
 
04:40:00.050 --> 04:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
and and rewrite their standards to allow
 
04:40:02.690 --> 04:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
these so it's not going to be fast I'm
 
04:40:05.150 --> 04:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Guthrie well a
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman if I will go ahead
 
04:40:09.770 --> 04:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking a follow-up is
 
04:40:11.930 --> 04:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
it fair to say that this commission
 
04:40:14.690 --> 04:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
could act as a catalyst in the area that
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
you're working absolutely and that's why
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
I actually drove up here today is
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
because when I saw that on the list I
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
thought I need to go talk about that
 
04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
that's really important for all these
 
04:40:26.750 --> 04:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
small towns I think it is too thank you
 
04:40:29.090 --> 04:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
04:40:30.530 --> 04:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
04:40:32.270 --> 04:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
question I consider you to be an expert
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
in these areas
 
04:40:36.410 --> 04:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
um when we were talking about the
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
four-plex bill I was talking to my
 
04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
constituents in a single family
 
04:40:42.730 --> 04:40:42.740 align:start position:0%
residential neighborhood who were
 
04:40:45.770 --> 04:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly opposed to this and so I
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
was trying to
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
talk to them about what we need to do
 
04:40:52.130 --> 04:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere in this commission
 
04:40:54.650 --> 04:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
that's going to that I see is going to
 
04:40:58.490 --> 04:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
consider how to educate people
 
04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
about the need
 
04:41:03.708 --> 04:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
um and maybe change some Minds about
 
04:41:07.130 --> 04:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
their backyards could you yeah
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think that's actually the
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
job of this committee but I think that's
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
a really important Point
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I do know that the Housing
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
Opportunity planning grants that have
 
04:41:21.470 --> 04:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
been being dispersed this year and that
 
04:41:25.010 --> 04:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'm working on they have a huge piece
 
04:41:28.368 --> 04:41:28.378 align:start position:0%
that is public engagement and the whole
 
04:41:30.708 --> 04:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
purpose of that is in an effort to
 
04:41:33.530 --> 04:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
change hearts and Minds about what we
 
04:41:35.270 --> 04:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
04:41:35.280 --> 04:41:36.010 align:start position:0%
need to do
um

04:41:36.010 --> 04:41:36.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:38.448 --> 04:41:38.458 align:start position:0%
I don't see that as the purview of this
 
04:41:40.368 --> 04:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
committee but I absolutely agree that
 
04:41:42.410 --> 04:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's a thing to do and I do think that
 
04:41:44.270 --> 04:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
the work that this committee is
 
04:41:48.050 --> 04:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
proposing to do would be helpful in
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
having that conversation
 
04:41:53.090 --> 04:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
04:41:55.490 --> 04:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
see no more questions thank you for your
 
04:41:57.170 --> 04:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so much for having
 
04:41:59.810 --> 04:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
me you're welcome next up we have uh
 
04:42:07.250 --> 04:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.730 --> 04:42:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
while on my face first I do have written
 
04:42:21.890 --> 04:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
and just as a reminder we are kind of
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
maintaining a three minute brief thank
 
04:42:29.868 --> 04:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for hearing my testimony
 
04:42:33.890 --> 04:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
today my name is Christy St Laurent and
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the New Hampshire State
 
04:42:38.570 --> 04:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
Commission on Aging just as a reminder
 
04:42:40.990 --> 04:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
the commission was established in 2019
 
04:42:44.930 --> 04:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
by the legislative session to advise the
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
general court and the governor on issues
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
related to Aging in recognition that New
 
04:42:52.490 --> 04:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire demographically speaking is
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
becoming older we're one of the oldest
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
State's fastest aging States you guys
 
04:42:58.610 --> 04:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
have all heard that before so what we're
 
04:43:00.410 --> 04:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
seeking is thoughtful shaping of public
 
04:43:03.288 --> 04:43:03.298 align:start position:0%
policy and investing across Generations
 
04:43:05.090 --> 04:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
that will ready our state for this
 
04:43:07.250 --> 04:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
change and Foster a future in which we
 
04:43:09.530 --> 04:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
can all Thrive which is why I'm here
 
04:43:11.690 --> 04:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
speaking on this issue
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
there's two prongs for the support from
 
04:43:16.690 --> 04:43:16.700 align:start position:0%
the Commission on Aging
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
one is housing when the commission and
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
DHS did the update to the state plan on
 
04:43:29.628 --> 04:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
Aging one of the top two concerns of the
 
04:43:31.368 --> 04:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
older adults that we heard speak from
 
04:43:34.010 --> 04:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
across the state was the availability
 
04:43:37.730 --> 04:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
and affordability of housing
 
04:43:41.208 --> 04:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
many older adults find that driving is
 
04:43:43.970 --> 04:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
difficult and so they want to be close
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
to services so the increased density
 
04:43:50.090 --> 04:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
would not only help to draw services to
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
them but would make it easier for them
 
04:43:54.288 --> 04:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
to access them
 
04:43:56.330 --> 04:43:56.340 align:start position:0%
it also allows for more efficient
 
04:43:59.208 --> 04:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
delivery of home-based services you've
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
all heard about the lack of Direct Care
 
04:44:04.250 --> 04:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
Workforce in New Hampshire and the
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
impacts that's having so it would allow
 
04:44:07.250 --> 04:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
more efficient delivery of those
 
04:44:07.260 --> 04:44:08.510 align:start position:0%
more efficient delivery of those
services

04:44:08.510 --> 04:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:44:12.110 --> 04:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
and it would also by having available
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
and affordable housing that is also
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
accessible to older adults it would
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
allow their probably larger house on a
 
04:44:21.770 --> 04:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
large lot to be able to go back into the
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
supply for families seeking housing
 
04:44:28.368 --> 04:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
the second prong of our support is for
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
that Direct Care Workforce I just
 
04:44:32.448 --> 04:44:32.458 align:start position:0%
mentioned older adults in need of
 
04:44:34.368 --> 04:44:34.378 align:start position:0%
services are not able to find the
 
04:44:36.530 --> 04:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
services are not able to find the hours
 
04:44:38.448 --> 04:44:38.458 align:start position:0%
of services that they need because of
 
04:44:40.910 --> 04:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
this shortage affordable housing would
 
04:44:43.010 --> 04:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
support Recruitment and Retention which
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
is a big issue in the Direct Care
 
04:44:45.000 --> 04:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
is a big issue in the Direct Care
Workforce

04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
density makes that affordability and
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
availability attainable in 2020 New
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Direct Care median income
 
04:44:58.730 --> 04:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
was 21 500 which puts them at or below
 
04:45:01.250 --> 04:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
the ability to afford housing in New
 
04:45:03.948 --> 04:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in fact 28 percent of New
 
04:45:05.570 --> 04:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Direct Care Workforce that
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
year lacked available housing
 
04:45:10.250 --> 04:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
the commission on aging's meeting
 
04:45:12.410 --> 04:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
earlier this month month focused on the
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
topic of Aging there were articles about
 
04:45:17.930 --> 04:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
it in the New Hampshire bulletin and
 
04:45:19.610 --> 04:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
also there was just recently an article
 
04:45:22.070 --> 04:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the Valley News entitled rapidly
 
04:45:24.050 --> 04:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
changing property values squeeze
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:31.610 --> 04:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
there was also supportive information
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
along these lines and that we heard that
 
04:45:33.600 --> 04:45:35.050 align:start position:0%
along these lines and that we heard that
morning

04:45:35.050 --> 04:45:35.060 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:45:37.610 --> 04:45:37.620 align:start position:0%
regarding the Statewide housing needs
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
assessment published by the New
 
04:45:42.470 --> 04:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
04:45:44.570 --> 04:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
compared to the the house special
 
04:45:47.330 --> 04:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
committee on housing the charge of SB 47
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
is seen by the commission to be narrow
 
04:45:51.890 --> 04:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
we're in scope and with discrete tasks
 
04:45:54.830 --> 04:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
that would Target the issues that are
 
04:45:57.410 --> 04:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
part of the fabric of the housing crisis
 
04:45:59.570 --> 04:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
facing older adults
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
certainly there's also been talk with
 
04:46:04.128 --> 04:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms getting backed up and
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
part of that problem is older adults not
 
04:46:08.750 --> 04:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
have when they need to be discharged not
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
having a safe and secure place to be
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
discharged home to and again that's by
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
in some cases because they are unable to
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
afford or able to take care of houses on
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
their own and they don't have anywhere
 
04:46:23.090 --> 04:46:23.100 align:start position:0%
to go and with nowhere to discharge them
 
04:46:25.070 --> 04:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
they stay in our hospitals and emergency
 
04:46:25.080 --> 04:46:26.570 align:start position:0%
they stay in our hospitals and emergency
rooms

04:46:26.570 --> 04:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
04:46:29.208 --> 04:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
okay you're close to being done because
 
04:46:31.970 --> 04:46:31.980 align:start position:0%

04:46:37.128 --> 04:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.690 --> 04:46:38.700 align:start position:0%

good afternoon my name is Bob Quinn I am
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%

04:46:59.810 --> 04:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
of Realtors and we are in support of the
 
04:46:59.820 --> 04:47:00.948 align:start position:0%
of Realtors and we are in support of the
bill

04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:47:00.958 --> 04:47:01.550 align:start position:0%
bill
um

04:47:01.550 --> 04:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:04.730 --> 04:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
I will say first of all um thank you to
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
the house uh recently on hb2 by
 
04:47:10.670 --> 04:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
inserting an appropriation of about 40
 
04:47:13.610 --> 04:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars for both the New
 
04:47:14.930 --> 04:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire affordable housing fund as
 
04:47:16.850 --> 04:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
well as invest New Hampshire those are
 
04:47:20.030 --> 04:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
much needed dollars to expand access and
 
04:47:21.650 --> 04:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
affordability of housing in the in the
 
04:47:22.850 --> 04:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
04:47:24.770 --> 04:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind that even in the best
 
04:47:27.288 --> 04:47:27.298 align:start position:0%
case scenario those funds are only going
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
to bring in several thousand new units
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
three four thousand units as you've
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
heard before we're about 20 000 units
 
04:47:35.208 --> 04:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
shy today
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
so where are those other units are going
 
04:47:38.810 --> 04:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
to come from I think this discussion
 
04:47:40.250 --> 04:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have in this
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh will help bring forward
 
04:47:45.470 --> 04:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
some of those Solutions I have a lot of
 
04:47:48.410 --> 04:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
data uh to sort of underscore and
 
04:47:51.288 --> 04:47:51.298 align:start position:0%
highlight the problem with housing the
 
04:47:52.610 --> 04:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
dire situation of housing in New
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I'm only going to leave
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
you with one and that is we have an
 
04:47:58.850 --> 04:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
affordability index that we track which
 
04:48:00.890 --> 04:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
is basically we look at what is the
 
04:48:02.330 --> 04:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
median income in New Hampshire versus
 
04:48:04.368 --> 04:48:04.378 align:start position:0%
what is the median sale price
 
04:48:06.350 --> 04:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
right now that affordability index is at
 
04:48:06.360 --> 04:48:07.490 align:start position:0%
right now that affordability index is at
70.

04:48:07.490 --> 04:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
70.
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
it's an all-time low what does that mean
 
04:48:11.570 --> 04:48:11.580 align:start position:0%
it means the median income in New
 
04:48:13.730 --> 04:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is only 70 percent of what is
 
04:48:16.010 --> 04:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
needed to afford the median sale price
 
04:48:17.570 --> 04:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
of a single-family home in New Hampshire
 
04:48:20.570 --> 04:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
which is 445 thousand dollars
 
04:48:23.628 --> 04:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
so while other states I think in this
 
04:48:25.490 --> 04:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
region are aggressively looking at
 
04:48:27.770 --> 04:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
opportunities and means in which to
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
expand housing in those States I think
 
04:48:32.090 --> 04:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also needs to follow
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
through and find solutions that work
 
04:48:36.288 --> 04:48:36.298 align:start position:0%
uniquely for New Hampshire and Order
 
04:48:38.448 --> 04:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
expanding housing affordability and
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
increase inventory
 
04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:48:44.090 --> 04:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
nice job
 
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
less than two minutes
 
04:48:48.650 --> 04:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Guthrie I
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
have an equipment
 
04:48:54.288 --> 04:48:54.298 align:start position:0%
can you tell me why we the builders
 
04:48:56.930 --> 04:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
continue to build 400
 
04:48:59.448 --> 04:48:59.458 align:start position:0%
000 homes and up
 
04:49:03.470 --> 04:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
and can you tell me why the how the uh
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
the single wide double wide housing that
 
04:49:10.128 --> 04:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
is ideal for us the seniors are not
 
04:49:14.570 --> 04:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
being built uh in New Hampshire
 
04:49:18.050 --> 04:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
it's a very long answer that I'm not
 
04:49:19.150 --> 04:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
I will say this I think you heard a bill
 
04:49:23.690 --> 04:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
prior to this one that helped to explain
 
04:49:25.850 --> 04:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
some of the costs that go into building
 
04:49:28.730 --> 04:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
single family homes I think there are
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
issues with some municipalities in how
 
04:49:36.410 --> 04:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
they uh Zone single family uh to family
 
04:49:37.730 --> 04:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
three family that make it very
 
04:49:41.208 --> 04:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
challenging to build more densely and
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
create greater costs so I think again
 
04:49:49.128 --> 04:49:49.138 align:start position:0%
this commission would provide an
 
04:49:51.050 --> 04:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all voices to get
 
04:49:52.610 --> 04:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
together and try to come up with some
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
solutions to that thank you Mr chairman
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
see no more questions thank you very
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much
 
04:50:03.288 --> 04:50:03.298 align:start position:0%

Hampshire was one of the organizations
 
04:50:29.330 --> 04:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
that had advocated for the creation of
 
04:50:32.690 --> 04:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
the commission we followed its work and
 
04:50:35.090 --> 04:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
then saw its work stall out during covid
 
04:50:38.448 --> 04:50:38.458 align:start position:0%
and so I thought it would be helpful for
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
you to kind of understand the history
 
04:50:44.270 --> 04:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and we were also working with
 
04:50:46.010 --> 04:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
leadership here in the house to create
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
the new special committee on housing so
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
I thought I could distinguish that for
 
04:50:53.150 --> 04:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
you and also happen to be part of the
 
04:50:55.910 --> 04:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
group way back in 08 that was helping
 
04:50:57.410 --> 04:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
facilitate the growth and development
 
04:50:57.420 --> 04:50:58.690 align:start position:0%
facilitate the growth and development
Roundtable

04:50:58.690 --> 04:50:58.700 align:start position:0%
Roundtable
 
04:51:01.368 --> 04:51:01.378 align:start position:0%
so hopefully I could just provide that
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:07.970 --> 04:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
um essentially we understand that in
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
order to increase production and
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
affordability to keep New Hampshire's
 
04:51:13.788 --> 04:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
rural character and preserve our
 
04:51:17.868 --> 04:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
beautiful uh uh natural spaces we need
 
04:51:19.730 --> 04:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
to understand density and we need to do
 
04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
that in Partnership and we need the
 
04:51:23.330 --> 04:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
expertise of folks who are going to tell
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
us about septic water sewer alteration
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
of terrain very technical issues and we
 
04:51:30.530 --> 04:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
need to find consensus a move forward
 
04:51:34.010 --> 04:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
policy where there is uh you know buy-in
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
and educate our municipalities in ways
 
04:51:40.310 --> 04:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
so that we can address this dire housing
 
04:51:41.810 --> 04:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
need and that's what the work of this
 
04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
commission has been and they were making
 
04:51:46.850 --> 04:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
progress and we're simply asking the
 
04:51:49.610 --> 04:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
house to reconvene them and allow them
 
04:51:52.850 --> 04:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
to create their final report and deliver
 
04:51:55.810 --> 04:51:55.820 align:start position:0%
it at a time where there is
 
04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
unprecedented I think political will to
 
04:52:00.050 --> 04:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
really doing something about the problem
 
04:52:01.850 --> 04:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
and that we do have this special
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee that's about to go into their
 
04:52:07.128 --> 04:52:07.138 align:start position:0%
kind of policy proposal stage for next
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
session so with that history and context
 
04:52:12.050 --> 04:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
we urge you to pass this bill happy to
 
04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
04:52:16.368 --> 04:52:16.378 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I see no questions
 
04:52:16.378 --> 04:52:19.550 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I see no questions
excellent

04:52:19.550 --> 04:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.670 --> 04:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
final pink card we have for this bill
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good afternoon
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is Ben Frost
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy executive director and
 
04:52:38.930 --> 04:52:38.940 align:start position:0%
chief legal officer at New Hampshire
 
04:52:42.170 --> 04:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
housing it's my pleasure to be here this
 
04:52:43.730 --> 04:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
afternoon to express New Hampshire
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
housing support for Senate bill 47. I
 
04:52:49.610 --> 04:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
served on and was the clerk of the
 
04:52:51.890 --> 04:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
preceding density commission and so I
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
got a a
 
04:52:58.010 --> 04:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
front row seat as witness to the work
 
04:52:59.570 --> 04:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
that the commission did and was
 
04:53:02.448 --> 04:53:02.458 align:start position:0%
recording it in the minutes
 
04:53:04.690 --> 04:53:04.700 align:start position:0%
um the commission did substantial work
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
but then as has been noted was stalled
 
04:53:10.850 --> 04:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
by covid we lost six months of time and
 
04:53:12.770 --> 04:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
were unable to complete some of the most
 
04:53:14.208 --> 04:53:14.218 align:start position:0%
important tasks
 
04:53:16.610 --> 04:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
which are outlined here in the purposes
 
04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
of this proposed Commission
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
so I'll draw your attention to a couple
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
of them
 
04:53:26.810 --> 04:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
um one as Ivy van mentioned examination
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
of septic standards this is really
 
04:53:29.930 --> 04:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
important this was one of the things
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
that was a specific charge of the
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
preceding commission and they simply
 
04:53:36.350 --> 04:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't get to it because of the the
 
04:53:38.570 --> 04:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
time that was lost
 
04:53:42.830 --> 04:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
two this is on page two lines eight and
 
04:53:45.410 --> 04:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
nine the impacts of development looking
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
at school enrollment I'll tell you right
 
04:53:49.730 --> 04:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire housing has just
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
launched a study on this on this very
 
04:53:55.788 --> 04:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
issue and so we expect to have the
 
04:53:58.550 --> 04:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
results of that study in time for this
 
04:54:00.770 --> 04:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
commission should it be formed to be
 
04:54:01.970 --> 04:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
able to take that up and perhaps
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
identify appropriate legislative
 
04:54:04.080 --> 04:54:06.230 align:start position:0%
identify appropriate legislative
responses

04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
responses
 
04:54:08.810 --> 04:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
um and third I'll note on lines six and
 
04:54:10.730 --> 04:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
seven of page two exploring possible
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
methods of enforcement of the shared
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
Community responsibility of Workforce
 
04:54:14.160 --> 04:54:15.170 align:start position:0%
Community responsibility of Workforce
housing

04:54:15.170 --> 04:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's language that was added to the
 
04:54:19.368 --> 04:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
the original legislation that
 
04:54:21.170 --> 04:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
established the preceding commission
 
04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
added by this committee
 
04:54:27.410 --> 04:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
which noted the importance of uh
 
04:54:29.750 --> 04:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing and looking at it from
 
04:54:32.570 --> 04:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
a regional perspective so this committee
 
04:54:35.530 --> 04:54:35.540 align:start position:0%
took that very seriously
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
I'll just note that New Hampshire
 
04:54:41.150 --> 04:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
housing has just published a Statewide
 
04:54:43.730 --> 04:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
Regional Statewide housing needs
 
04:54:46.970 --> 04:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
assessment in which we identify a
 
04:54:49.128 --> 04:54:49.138 align:start position:0%
current shortage of housing in the state
 
04:54:52.970 --> 04:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
Statewide of over 23 500 units that's
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
the number of housing units that would
 
04:54:57.050 --> 04:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
be needed to restore the market to
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
something we would consider to be a
 
04:55:01.368 --> 04:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
stable Market that balances the
 
04:55:04.128 --> 04:55:04.138 align:start position:0%
interests of buyers and sellers that
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
balances the interests of landlords and
 
04:55:08.448 --> 04:55:08.458 align:start position:0%
tenants we are a long way from that but
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
it is achievable and that doesn't
 
04:55:13.310 --> 04:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
account for potential for future growth
 
04:55:16.510 --> 04:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
that our employers so desperately need
 
04:55:20.750 --> 04:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
we if we do not accommodate a growing
 
04:55:23.448 --> 04:55:23.458 align:start position:0%
Workforce by providing relatively
 
04:55:25.190 --> 04:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
affordable and I don't mean capital A
 
04:55:27.050 --> 04:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
affordable I mean lowercase a affordable
 
04:55:30.110 --> 04:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
relatively affordable housing for our
 
04:55:32.930 --> 04:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
labor force to occupy that will put a
 
04:55:34.970 --> 04:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
pinch on our economy which
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
you know how important that is for the
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
state to continue its operations
 
04:55:43.970 --> 04:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
I'll just want to close by responding to
 
04:55:46.090 --> 04:55:46.100 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie's questions
 
04:55:48.890 --> 04:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
regarding single wide and double wide
 
04:55:52.490 --> 04:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're not being built because in most
 
04:55:54.470 --> 04:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
cases municipalities do not allow them
 
04:55:57.770 --> 04:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
to be placed on individual Lots they
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
only allow them in manufactured housing
 
04:56:02.690 --> 04:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
parks where they already where those
 
04:56:04.550 --> 04:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
Parks already exist and there's limited
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to expand so in the
 
04:56:10.368 --> 04:56:10.378 align:start position:0%
municipalities do this legally they that
 
04:56:11.948 --> 04:56:11.958 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the law
 
04:56:14.448 --> 04:56:14.458 align:start position:0%
municipalities must allow manufactured
 
04:56:16.850 --> 04:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
housing in one of three ways one of
 
04:56:18.650 --> 04:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
which is Parks so if they go out in
 
04:56:20.270 --> 04:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
Parks then they've met the the legal
 
04:56:22.730 --> 04:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
obligation and they can say no you can't
 
04:56:25.490 --> 04:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
do that on a single lot so that's why it
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't get quite the single wides and
 
04:56:31.788 --> 04:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
double wides don't get built and why 400
 
04:56:34.368 --> 04:56:34.378 align:start position:0%
000 homes it's a question of economics
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
if zoning only allows large lot large
 
04:56:41.150 --> 04:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
lots to be developed then the only way a
 
04:56:42.708 --> 04:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
developer can and profitably build a
 
04:56:44.448 --> 04:56:44.458 align:start position:0%
house is to build a larger home which is
 
04:56:46.550 --> 04:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
going to sell at a higher price the
 
04:56:47.810 --> 04:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
purpose of this commission is to
 
04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
identify ways in which municipalities
 
04:56:50.280 --> 04:56:51.850 align:start position:0%
identify ways in which municipalities
can

04:56:51.850 --> 04:56:51.860 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:56:54.708 --> 04:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
accommodate denser development which is
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
the way we will achieve greater housing
 
04:56:59.330 --> 04:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
affordability in New Hampshire but to do
 
04:56:59.340 --> 04:57:00.050 align:start position:0%
affordability in New Hampshire but to do
it

04:57:00.050 --> 04:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:57:02.208 --> 04:57:02.218 align:start position:0%
in a way that is consistent with
 
04:57:05.448 --> 04:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
Community character that's the hard task
 
04:57:07.128 --> 04:57:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:10.010 --> 04:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
is there representative power has a
 
04:57:12.110 --> 04:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman I have
 
04:57:15.170 --> 04:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
two unrelated questions one's quick
 
04:57:16.970 --> 04:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
could I ask too
 
04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
you may ask one and then okay follow up
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so my first quick question is
 
04:57:25.490 --> 04:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
is there could you please inform the
 
04:57:28.310 --> 04:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee as to where we might find the
 
04:57:31.788 --> 04:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
reports of the previous commission for
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
for our study
 
04:57:36.230 --> 04:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
I happily representative power and in
 
04:57:39.050 --> 04:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
fact New Hampshire housing had a website
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
or web a web page on our website for
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
that we have all of those records I'll
 
04:57:47.448 --> 04:57:47.458 align:start position:0%
be happy to send them to uh I'll send it
 
04:57:48.708 --> 04:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
to the full mailing list for the
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee follow up go ahead yes thank
 
04:57:55.190 --> 04:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
you so um I appreciate in the in the um
 
04:57:57.530 --> 04:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
in the text of this bill on page two
 
04:58:00.530 --> 04:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
lines eight nine as you um highlighted
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
that one of the charges of this
 
04:58:04.970 --> 04:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
commission would be to study the impacts
 
04:58:06.890 --> 04:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
of a development but then it says
 
04:58:10.550 --> 04:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
specifically the impacts on on schools
 
04:58:12.530 --> 04:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
how that would affect the municipalities
 
04:58:15.530 --> 04:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that's great but
 
04:58:18.230 --> 04:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
additionally is there any language in
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:58:21.770 --> 04:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
um that would
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
ask or require that additional impacts
 
04:58:29.090 --> 04:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
be also looked at such as infrastructure
 
04:58:32.930 --> 04:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
Municipal services and what those types
 
04:58:32.940 --> 04:58:34.030 align:start position:0%
Municipal services and what those types
of

04:58:34.030 --> 04:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:58:38.330 --> 04:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:40.610 --> 04:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question I would
 
04:58:45.410 --> 04:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
say yes indirectly if you look at a page
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
two lines one through three the minimum
 
04:58:49.610 --> 04:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
standards for residential development
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on public water and sewer uh it
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about the cost necessarily
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
but certainly if if this committee
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to add that as a charge for this
 
04:59:03.708 --> 04:59:03.718 align:start position:0%
committee that uh for this commission
 
04:59:08.030 --> 04:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh representative Brown
 
04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um if I understand
 
04:59:16.970 --> 04:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
correctly you were on the previous
 
04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
commission is that correct that is
 
04:59:21.830 --> 04:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
correct so with that said
 
04:59:24.050 --> 04:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
um what do you think your success was
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
before and how do you expect to bring
 
04:59:29.150 --> 04:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
that forward as far as a positive impact
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
on on getting additional housing uh as
 
04:59:33.708 --> 04:59:33.718 align:start position:0%
opposed to what the new commission would
 
04:59:33.718 --> 04:59:35.090 align:start position:0%
opposed to what the new commission would
do

04:59:35.090 --> 04:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:59:37.250 --> 04:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question and and
 
04:59:40.490 --> 04:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to what I said before and
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
other speakers said too uh the work of
 
04:59:45.110 --> 04:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
the the prior commission uh was stalled
 
04:59:48.110 --> 04:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
like we lost six months of time uh which
 
04:59:50.810 --> 04:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
was at a point in the commission's work
 
04:59:54.410 --> 04:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
when it was gearing up to do frankly the
 
04:59:57.770 --> 04:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
heavy lifting we had done many months of
 
04:59:59.930 --> 04:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
fact-finding gotten a lot of testimony a
 
05:00:02.330 --> 05:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
lot of different presentations and
 
05:00:04.628 --> 05:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
assembled a lot of information
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
but then you know was it March 20th 2020
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
the world shut down and so did that
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
commission the commission only resumed
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
its work in
 
05:00:20.208 --> 05:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
uh very late August of 2020 in time to
 
05:00:23.208 --> 05:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
do a final report and there just wasn't
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
time to do it as I say that the heavy
 
05:00:27.350 --> 05:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
lifting of that Commission
 
05:00:30.650 --> 05:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
that uh the re-establishment of that
 
05:00:32.570 --> 05:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
commission formation of a new commission
 
05:00:35.868 --> 05:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
following in its steps would allow uh
 
05:00:39.470 --> 05:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:41.208 --> 05:00:41.218 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
05:00:44.628 --> 05:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to understand I'm not
 
05:00:45.830 --> 05:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
trying to be negative here I'm trying to
 
05:00:49.128 --> 05:00:49.138 align:start position:0%
understand what was accomplished so that
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
we get positive results out of the
 
05:00:54.170 --> 05:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
previous work so we can move forward
 
05:00:57.410 --> 05:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
with with Ashley getting some positive
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
results with this and I assume it's
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
going to go forward with this that
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
information come forward to the new
 
05:01:03.948 --> 05:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
commission and that commission would
 
05:01:05.628 --> 05:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
carry on so that we get some positive
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
results of all the all the work so what
 
05:01:10.128 --> 05:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
what would you expect that to be
 
05:01:14.270 --> 05:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh well I I think if you uh
 
05:01:16.190 --> 05:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative if you look at the the
 
05:01:18.890 --> 05:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
charge of this commission you can
 
05:01:22.250 --> 05:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
identify uh certain potential products
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
and deliverables of the commission model
 
05:01:27.430 --> 05:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
ordinances uh
 
05:01:30.288 --> 05:01:30.298 align:start position:0%
working with Des which would be
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
represented on this commission to
 
05:01:36.368 --> 05:01:36.378 align:start position:0%
identify what appropriate revisions to
 
05:01:38.890 --> 05:01:38.900 align:start position:0%
septic standards are
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
and then send Des off to do its
 
05:01:45.550 --> 05:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking in consistent with that
 
05:01:48.770 --> 05:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
providing municipalities with additional
 
05:01:48.780 --> 05:01:50.050 align:start position:0%
providing municipalities with additional
tools

05:01:50.050 --> 05:01:50.060 align:start position:0%
tools
 
05:01:54.948 --> 05:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
partly to visualize what uh additional
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
density looks like
 
05:02:00.170 --> 05:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it a lot of the
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of the density that
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
we live with right now is think some
 
05:02:09.708 --> 05:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
things that we don't acknowledge
 
05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
so we look at
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
um you know our cherished historic
 
05:02:15.830 --> 05:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
communities I used to live in Amherst
 
05:02:18.050 --> 05:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
which has this
 
05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
gorgeous town center and if you look at
 
05:02:23.390 --> 05:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
the density of Amherst of the village of
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
Amherst it's pretty dense
 
05:02:28.610 --> 05:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
and yet Villages like that can't be
 
05:02:30.170 --> 05:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
built under most of our zoning
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances and yet that's what we love
 
05:02:33.948 --> 05:02:33.958 align:start position:0%
so much about New Hampshire it's the
 
05:02:36.650 --> 05:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
villages and then the spaces between
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
places so identifying areas that are
 
05:02:42.050 --> 05:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate for conservation I'm getting
 
05:02:44.750 --> 05:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
off into good planning right now
 
05:02:46.490 --> 05:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate for conservation
 
05:02:48.650 --> 05:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate for development and
 
05:02:51.050 --> 05:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
where we are going to develop how can we
 
05:02:53.270 --> 05:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
do it best that's really I think
 
05:02:56.030 --> 05:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh the mission of this uh
 
05:02:57.830 --> 05:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
this body this commission thanks I
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it that certainly clarified
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
your thoughts representative save us
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for taking
 
05:03:06.410 --> 05:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:03:09.650 --> 05:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
um I struggle with the um the concept
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
that increased density will inevitably
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
lead to more affordability
 
05:03:16.080 --> 05:03:18.050 align:start position:0%
lead to more affordability
and

05:03:18.050 --> 05:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:20.690 --> 05:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon we have not seen that happen
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
prices just keep going up so I'm
 
05:03:26.448 --> 05:03:26.458 align:start position:0%
wondering will this Commission
 
05:03:29.868 --> 05:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
which I think is necessary for the place
 
05:03:32.330 --> 05:03:32.340 align:start position:0%
that we're in right now will you be
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
looking at where those two lines cross
 
05:03:37.490 --> 05:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
and why
 
05:03:40.970 --> 05:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
where does density equal affordability
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
what is the mechanism that makes that
 
05:03:46.490 --> 05:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
happen and why is it not happening now
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
oh representative what a great question
 
05:03:53.090 --> 05:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh and and a a deep philosophical one
 
05:03:56.590 --> 05:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
too uh that goes into uh
 
05:04:00.530 --> 05:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
economics I think to respond directly to
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
your question I think uh what you're
 
05:04:06.910 --> 05:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
witnessing in Lebanon is uh
 
05:04:12.110 --> 05:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
the market responding to dire need for
 
05:04:13.670 --> 05:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
more housing
 
05:04:18.650 --> 05:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
and the supply even though Lebanon has
 
05:04:21.470 --> 05:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
as a community has done so much
 
05:04:24.410 --> 05:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
the supply still not being enough to
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
meet the current demand because so
 
05:04:30.890 --> 05:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
little has been done for so long
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have statewide uh a as I said this uh
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
pretty significant shortage of housing
 
05:04:41.448 --> 05:04:41.458 align:start position:0%
until we meet that shortage we're not
 
05:04:42.970 --> 05:04:42.980 align:start position:0%
going to see
 
05:04:46.250 --> 05:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
the prices really stabilizing we've got
 
05:04:49.010 --> 05:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
to do a lot and we have to have more
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
communities like Lebanon stepping up to
 
05:04:54.170 --> 05:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
meet this challenge
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
representative color
 
05:04:58.368 --> 05:04:58.378 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
 
05:05:00.288 --> 05:05:00.298 align:start position:0%
question earlier today we had a bill
 
05:05:00.298 --> 05:05:01.788 align:start position:0%
question earlier today we had a bill
about

05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the extreme cost of infrastructure as
 
05:05:07.490 --> 05:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
far as
 
05:05:11.690 --> 05:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
um per mile of of broadband
 
05:05:15.050 --> 05:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
um and so obviously having more density
 
05:05:19.128 --> 05:05:19.138 align:start position:0%
per mile of that extreme cost would
 
05:05:23.170 --> 05:05:23.180 align:start position:0%
reduce that per per per per unit cost
 
05:05:26.930 --> 05:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
can you talk a little bit about the
 
05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
other types of infrastructure that
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
um and their significant costs
 
05:05:37.270 --> 05:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
um that might be a little bit
 
05:05:41.510 --> 05:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
reduced per unit by The increased
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
density since since it kind of follows
 
05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
up on the previous question and if you
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
could do that in a brief manner please
 
05:05:50.930 --> 05:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:53.330 --> 05:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman I understand you're over
 
05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
time now and so am I
 
05:05:59.990 --> 05:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
um representative yes I this is a great
 
05:06:03.050 --> 05:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
question uh and let me
 
05:06:05.810 --> 05:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
answer it briefly by saying New
 
05:06:08.270 --> 05:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing recently worked with a
 
05:06:12.170 --> 05:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
consulting firm called Urban three they
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
are National specialists in looking at
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
Municipal costs that and revenues that
 
05:06:20.270 --> 05:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
are associated with different kinds of
 
05:06:20.280 --> 05:06:21.410 align:start position:0%
are associated with different kinds of
development

05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
development
 
05:06:24.770 --> 05:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
and we we those reports we have uh phase
 
05:06:27.830 --> 05:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
one report which looks at Municipal uh
 
05:06:27.840 --> 05:06:28.850 align:start position:0%
one report which looks at Municipal uh
Revenue

05:06:28.850 --> 05:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
05:06:31.010 --> 05:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
so what kind of taxes do municipalities
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
get based on different kinds of land
 
05:06:36.470 --> 05:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
uses uh and we are just about to get the
 
05:06:38.810 --> 05:06:38.820 align:start position:0%
final report on phase two of that which
 
05:06:42.530 --> 05:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
looks at uh Municipal costs which looks
 
05:06:47.030 --> 05:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
at uh the um not not so much Broadband
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
because that's that is a more difficult
 
05:06:52.850 --> 05:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
question to get to but the pipes the
 
05:06:56.750 --> 05:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
water and sewer uh roads and looks at
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
the efficiencies that you get by having
 
05:07:03.890 --> 05:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
greater density of development on that
 
05:07:06.350 --> 05:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure rather than
 
05:07:09.490 --> 05:07:09.500 align:start position:0%
I'll use the word sprawling it out
 
05:07:11.570 --> 05:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
inefficiently from a cost perspective
 
05:07:14.110 --> 05:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
from a municipal cost perspective
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
allowing sprawl to consume the
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
countryside and sending our dpws out to
 
05:07:22.850 --> 05:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
do work all over the place instead of
 
05:07:25.070 --> 05:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
focusing their efforts in a much more
 
05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
small smaller area
 
05:07:28.730 --> 05:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
we're happy to get those reports to you
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:07:31.490 --> 05:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:36.410 --> 05:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
no Miss representative majority no
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
05:07:39.650 --> 05:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
 
05:07:39.660 --> 05:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for your
testimony

05:07:43.430 --> 05:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:45.230 --> 05:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
okay I don't have any more pink cards I
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
have two people signed in in favor on
 
05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet and with that we will
 
05:07:55.250 --> 05:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
close the Herring on SB 47.
 
05:07:58.490 --> 05:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
and with that we were going to open up
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:07.850 --> 05:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
which is prohibiting cities and towns
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%

the United States is not facing one
 
05:08:58.910 --> 05:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
border crisis but two illegal crossings
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
from Canada into the U.S are surging
 
05:09:03.288 --> 05:09:03.298 align:start position:0%
according to Customs and Border
 
05:09:04.910 --> 05:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
Protection apprehensions along the
 
05:09:06.530 --> 05:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
border in New York Vermont and New
 
05:09:08.530 --> 05:09:08.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire increased
 
05:09:12.530 --> 05:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
846 percent from October 2022 through
 
05:09:14.810 --> 05:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
this January total encounters at the
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
northern border have increased 1300
 
05:09:21.410 --> 05:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
percent over the past two years CBP
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
actually sent 25 new agents to the
 
05:09:26.090 --> 05:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
northern border but unfortunately it did
 
05:09:28.010 --> 05:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
so by taking them away from patrolling
 
05:09:29.570 --> 05:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
the southern border yet the Biden
 
05:09:31.070 --> 05:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
Administration has refused New
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's request to have state
 
05:09:34.310 --> 05:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
authorities help enforce the Border
 
05:09:37.970 --> 05:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
where it has failed last year 434 people
 
05:09:39.288 --> 05:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire died from drug
 
05:09:42.650 --> 05:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
overdoses most from fentanyl smuggled
 
05:09:45.050 --> 05:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
across one border or the other one
 
05:09:48.288 --> 05:09:48.298 align:start position:0%
seizure in February found 4.5 million
 
05:09:50.990 --> 05:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
fentanyl pills 3 100 pounds of
 
05:09:52.910 --> 05:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine and large quantities of
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
heroin cocaine and Fentanyl powder in
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
2022 federal seizures on the southern
 
05:10:00.650 --> 05:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
border totaled more than 50 million
 
05:10:02.690 --> 05:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
fentanyl bills more than ten thousand
 
05:10:04.128 --> 05:10:04.138 align:start position:0%
pounds of fentanyl powder more than
 
05:10:06.288 --> 05:10:06.298 align:start position:0%
enough to kill every man woman and child
 
05:10:07.550 --> 05:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
in America
 
05:10:09.230 --> 05:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
at a recent congressional oversight
 
05:10:11.390 --> 05:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
hearing U.S border Patrol Chief Raul
 
05:10:13.730 --> 05:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
Ortiz admitted that the Biden
 
05:10:15.230 --> 05:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
Administration did not have quote
 
05:10:17.570 --> 05:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
operational control unquote of the
 
05:10:19.610 --> 05:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
Southern border that means the
 
05:10:21.770 --> 05:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
prevention of illegal entries including
 
05:10:24.230 --> 05:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
terrorists we need to address this issue
 
05:10:26.830 --> 05:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
now to protect New Hampshire citizens
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
sb-132 to be clear prevents Sanctuary
 
05:10:33.410 --> 05:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
policies but it does not mandate the
 
05:10:35.510 --> 05:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
towns participate in federal immigration
 
05:10:38.448 --> 05:10:38.458 align:start position:0%
enforcement it prevents policies not
 
05:10:40.550 --> 05:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
individual decisions it prevents
 
05:10:42.470 --> 05:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities from adopting blanket
 
05:10:44.330 --> 05:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policies that prevent law
 
05:10:47.208 --> 05:10:47.218 align:start position:0%
enforcement from ever executing an
 
05:10:49.128 --> 05:10:49.138 align:start position:0%
immigration detainer it does not mandate
 
05:10:51.110 --> 05:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
that they cooperate in each and every
 
05:10:53.448 --> 05:10:53.458 align:start position:0%
case New Hampshire municipalities should
 
05:10:55.250 --> 05:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
not be releasing illegal immigrants they
 
05:10:57.410 --> 05:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
arrest when they are sought by federal
 
05:11:00.288 --> 05:11:00.298 align:start position:0%
immigration officials Sanctuary policies
 
05:11:02.208 --> 05:11:02.218 align:start position:0%
would tell illegal immigrants to come to
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to avoid enforcement
 
05:11:05.390 --> 05:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
putting further strain on local
 
05:11:07.250 --> 05:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
resources we should not allow local
 
05:11:08.990 --> 05:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
officials officials to tie the hands of
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
their own police departments when
 
05:11:13.250 --> 05:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
cooperating with Federal officials and
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
preventing the release of dangerous
 
05:11:16.970 --> 05:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
criminals Senator Gannon thanks you for
 
05:11:18.650 --> 05:11:18.660 align:start position:0%

and uh when you see representative power
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
hold up the pink card that means you
 
05:11:53.270 --> 05:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
have 30 seconds left so
 
05:11:55.490 --> 05:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
everybody's on board all right very good

this is a a bill SB 132 is is called
 
05:12:35.448 --> 05:12:35.458 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and National Security just
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
plain and simple
 
05:12:40.368 --> 05:12:40.378 align:start position:0%
this is permissive legislation
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement has discretion to pursue
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:12:48.830 --> 05:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
um let's see where
 
05:12:54.110 --> 05:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
I can go from here
 
05:12:56.330 --> 05:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
I know the cartels are moving the drugs
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
up to Lawrence Mass and then
 
05:13:00.288 --> 05:13:00.298 align:start position:0%
distributation and distribute them
 
05:13:02.810 --> 05:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire
 
05:13:02.820 --> 05:13:03.890 align:start position:0%
through New Hampshire
Maine

05:13:03.890 --> 05:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
05:13:06.050 --> 05:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
and Vermont
 
05:13:10.128 --> 05:13:10.138 align:start position:0%
this has caused a problem with fentanyl
 
05:13:10.138 --> 05:13:11.208 align:start position:0%
this has caused a problem with fentanyl
here

05:13:11.208 --> 05:13:11.218 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:13:14.868 --> 05:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
overdoses have increased considerably I
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
think uh today I I heard on the the news
 
05:13:20.650 --> 05:13:20.660 align:start position:0%
it went increased 87
 
05:13:23.868 --> 05:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
overdoses in Manchester and Nashua this
 
05:13:23.878 --> 05:13:26.030 align:start position:0%
overdoses in Manchester and Nashua this
year

05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
um more than likely you know you know
 
05:13:30.830 --> 05:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
someone who's been affected by drugs
 
05:13:32.330 --> 05:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
05:13:35.330 --> 05:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
and um it's a sad case
 
05:13:38.448 --> 05:13:38.458 align:start position:0%
uh when that happens you you don't
 
05:13:41.208 --> 05:13:41.218 align:start position:0%
realize it and
 
05:13:44.090 --> 05:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
um it's it's bad when I was in the
 
05:13:44.100 --> 05:13:44.990 align:start position:0%
um it's it's bad when I was in the
military

05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
military
 
05:13:47.050 --> 05:13:47.060 align:start position:0%
I know the
 
05:13:50.030 --> 05:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
the Communist Chinese Communists used to
 
05:13:54.650 --> 05:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
prove uh bring heroin into the GIS
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it was Pure Heroin they came back
 
05:13:57.840 --> 05:13:58.730 align:start position:0%
and it was Pure Heroin they came back
here

05:13:58.730 --> 05:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:14:01.310 --> 05:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
and the heroin that they received or the
 
05:14:03.128 --> 05:14:03.138 align:start position:0%
drugs that they received here
 
05:14:06.530 --> 05:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
were far less than what they had
 
05:14:08.990 --> 05:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
caused overdoses we're in the same
 
05:14:11.570 --> 05:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
predicament here not with Heroin but
 
05:14:13.788 --> 05:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
with the Fentanyl and the drugs from the
 
05:14:13.798 --> 05:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
with the Fentanyl and the drugs from the
cartels

05:14:15.830 --> 05:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
cartels
 
05:14:15.840 --> 05:14:16.850 align:start position:0%
cartels
um

05:14:16.850 --> 05:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
on page two lines one and three defines
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
immigration law
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
um lines 14 to 16 defines policy
 
05:14:31.850 --> 05:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
uh line 17 to 22 defines a sanctuary
 
05:14:31.860 --> 05:14:32.990 align:start position:0%
uh line 17 to 22 defines a sanctuary
policy

05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
and lines 27-29
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
Define prohibition of sanctuary policies
 
05:14:42.050 --> 05:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
there was one thing I don't think was
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned but there was a doctor that
 
05:14:45.288 --> 05:14:45.298 align:start position:0%
was arrested
 
05:14:48.410 --> 05:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
in Woburn Massachusetts for altering
 
05:14:50.510 --> 05:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and they're getting
 
05:14:50.520 --> 05:14:52.310 align:start position:0%
fingerprints and they're getting
documents

05:14:52.310 --> 05:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
documents
 
05:14:55.930 --> 05:14:55.940 align:start position:0%
and not being able to prove who they are
 
05:14:58.788 --> 05:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
that was uh that person was arrested by
 
05:15:00.470 --> 05:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
the FBI
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh and it an admitted financier for a
 
05:15:06.170 --> 05:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
terrorist organization was arrested
 
05:15:08.090 --> 05:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
working in Rochester
 
05:15:10.190 --> 05:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
but he was living in Dover
 
05:15:10.200 --> 05:15:11.510 align:start position:0%
but he was living in Dover
and

05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:14.030 --> 05:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
that person was also arrested
 
05:15:14.040 --> 05:15:16.128 align:start position:0%
that person was also arrested
so

05:15:16.128 --> 05:15:16.138 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
border patrols are doing the job I know
 
05:15:22.190 --> 05:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
that there is a a two-way I think it was
 
05:15:26.150 --> 05:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
287 which is a
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's a what it does is it it
 
05:15:34.090 --> 05:15:34.100 align:start position:0%
deputizes either State Police
 
05:15:34.100 --> 05:15:35.650 align:start position:0%
deputizes either State Police
or

05:15:35.650 --> 05:15:35.660 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement as
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
a an immigration agent it's like they
 
05:15:47.570 --> 05:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
how they deputize the people in the in
 
05:15:49.368 --> 05:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
the old days
 
05:15:52.250 --> 05:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean uh
 
05:15:54.530 --> 05:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to debitize everyone I
 
05:15:56.570 --> 05:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
know the governor is looking at putting
 
05:15:56.580 --> 05:15:57.890 align:start position:0%
know the governor is looking at putting
together

05:15:57.890 --> 05:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:16:00.410 --> 05:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
more State Police up in the Border
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
because it's 51 miles that the people up
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
there can't handle and the the border
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
patrols are not being sent out to the
 
05:16:12.350 --> 05:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
Border to take care of this stuff I mean
 
05:16:17.810 --> 05:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:20.628 --> 05:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
oh they called they call uh
 
05:16:22.610 --> 05:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
Swanton sector
 
05:16:26.570 --> 05:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
up north that is governs New Hampshire
 
05:16:31.930 --> 05:16:31.940 align:start position:0%
and um I believe New Hampshire and
 
05:16:31.940 --> 05:16:34.868 align:start position:0%
and um I believe New Hampshire and
uh

05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:16:40.610 --> 05:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire and Canada border
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
and the other thing was is that the
 
05:16:42.360 --> 05:16:43.448 align:start position:0%
and the other thing was is that the
immigration

05:16:43.448 --> 05:16:43.458 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
05:16:45.890 --> 05:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
officers the only one
 
05:16:47.868 --> 05:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
that can re arrest
 
05:16:50.570 --> 05:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
a detainer and I don't think a lot of
 
05:16:52.670 --> 05:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
people know that they they think that
 
05:16:54.890 --> 05:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
the police can arrest
 
05:16:57.410 --> 05:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
um immigration because mere fact that
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
they feel that's the case there's no
 
05:17:01.368 --> 05:17:01.378 align:start position:0%
profiling in this bill
 
05:17:04.610 --> 05:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
and um I think that's pretty much it
 
05:17:06.650 --> 05:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Piemonte a
 
05:17:09.288 --> 05:17:09.298 align:start position:0%
question uh representative yokella thank
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking the question
 
05:17:11.638 --> 05:17:13.750 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking the question
um

05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:19.090 --> 05:17:19.100 align:start position:0%
what was kind of uh alluded to was
 
05:17:22.128 --> 05:17:22.138 align:start position:0%
essentially local
 
05:17:26.690 --> 05:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
um entities having something a policy
 
05:17:31.550 --> 05:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
it seemed uh to be explicitly stated but
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
in the definition of policy it does
 
05:17:36.770 --> 05:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
state that there isn't
 
05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
um Unwritten policies that would be
 
05:17:41.930 --> 05:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
um considered and just common practice
 
05:17:46.610 --> 05:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
or any practice uh I guess let's say the
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
the municipality is understaffed and
 
05:17:52.368 --> 05:17:52.378 align:start position:0%
they're they don't have a written policy
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
but they have an Unwritten practice of
 
05:17:56.638 --> 05:17:57.530 align:start position:0%
but they have an Unwritten practice of
not

05:17:57.530 --> 05:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:18:00.050 --> 05:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
giving themselves extra work when
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
they're understaffed and and for
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
um for a municipality to permit that
 
05:18:08.990 --> 05:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
um would be in breach of this
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislation do you think that is
 
05:18:11.280 --> 05:18:12.410 align:start position:0%
legislation do you think that is
um

05:18:12.410 --> 05:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:16.850 --> 05:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
um a little bit too uh restrictive on
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
those municipalities essentially saying
 
05:18:20.810 --> 05:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
that you have to
 
05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
um have
 
05:18:25.208 --> 05:18:25.218 align:start position:0%
um at least some practice of of abiding
 
05:18:28.030 --> 05:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
05:18:31.610 --> 05:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
helping these uh those Federal
 
05:18:34.550 --> 05:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
immigration laws that's that's what
 
05:18:37.788 --> 05:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
allows the local control to exist there
 
05:18:40.850 --> 05:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
they do not have to do that only if they
 
05:18:43.368 --> 05:18:43.378 align:start position:0%
want to it's not something that's uh
 
05:18:46.490 --> 05:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
forced upon them and that that is part
 
05:18:48.948 --> 05:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
of this bill it's permissive it's
 
05:18:48.958 --> 05:18:50.448 align:start position:0%
of this bill it's permissive it's
discretionary

05:18:50.448 --> 05:18:50.458 align:start position:0%
discretionary
 
05:18:55.610 --> 05:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:56.930 --> 05:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
05:19:00.590 --> 05:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you uh next uh
 
05:19:02.208 --> 05:19:02.218 align:start position:0%
for the record uh representative

Piemonte and my next uh presenter are
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
both co-sponsors of the bill so we've
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
given them just slightly more latitude
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:16.010 --> 05:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good afternoon

lot of homework for you and to to cut
 
05:19:24.350 --> 05:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
down on the time first of all this I've
 
05:19:26.690 --> 05:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
been here 13 years so this is one of the
 
05:19:28.490 --> 05:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
bills that comes back every term and I
 
05:19:31.128 --> 05:19:31.138 align:start position:0%
keep a file on bills like such as this
 
05:19:32.930 --> 05:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
so this is my file
 
05:19:36.770 --> 05:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
we had expert Witnesses when we test had
 
05:19:39.050 --> 05:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
the um the hearing in the Senate they
 
05:19:40.970 --> 05:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
were not able to be here today so I'm
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
going to just go over a little bit of
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
what they're going to talk about and you
 
05:19:45.708 --> 05:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
can read it
 
05:19:48.708 --> 05:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
um before you you um have your exact
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
session and if you have a study I'm
 
05:19:54.170 --> 05:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
sorry a work session on this bill I'd be
 
05:19:55.750 --> 05:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
happy to come back
 
05:19:59.090 --> 05:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
so when I testified in the Senate I
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
talked about the word alien because in
 
05:20:05.570 --> 05:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
the past that we had complaints people
 
05:20:07.850 --> 05:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
didn't want to use that word but from
 
05:20:10.368 --> 05:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
the retired senior special agent of the
 
05:20:12.350 --> 05:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
immigration and National Naturalization
 
05:20:15.288 --> 05:20:15.298 align:start position:0%
Service Michael Cutler we've had many
 
05:20:18.410 --> 05:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
conversations and I learned the origin
 
05:20:20.090 --> 05:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
of that word and why it is the proper
 
05:20:23.570 --> 05:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
word to use we had uh testify people
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
testify that said
 
05:20:27.110 --> 05:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
um you know these are people you're
 
05:20:29.510 --> 05:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're being you're being terrible but
 
05:20:31.610 --> 05:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
you did hear you know it's
 
05:20:33.530 --> 05:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
we have to vet people coming into this
 
05:20:35.690 --> 05:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
country we have a right to do that we we
 
05:20:37.610 --> 05:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
we need to do that it's prudent to do
 
05:20:39.708 --> 05:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
that everywhere else in the world they
 
05:20:41.810 --> 05:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
protect their borders they don't just
 
05:20:44.510 --> 05:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
allow anyone in and that's for our own
 
05:20:44.520 --> 05:20:45.770 align:start position:0%
allow anyone in and that's for our own
safety

05:20:45.770 --> 05:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:20:48.670 --> 05:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
I um testified that the term Sanctuary
 
05:20:51.288 --> 05:20:51.298 align:start position:0%
conjures up a comforting image of a
 
05:20:53.930 --> 05:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
place of security and serenity
 
05:20:56.270 --> 05:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
this term makes me think of refugees
 
05:20:58.128 --> 05:20:58.138 align:start position:0%
crossing the border to escape tyranny
 
05:21:00.410 --> 05:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
and those who would halt their arrival
 
05:21:03.590 --> 05:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
as unchristian and uncharitable in that
 
05:21:06.170 --> 05:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
respect I can't say that I disagree
 
05:21:07.970 --> 05:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
that falls under political Asylum and
 
05:21:11.930 --> 05:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about political Asylum
 
05:21:15.170 --> 05:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
so I did make copies of
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
Michael Cutler's words so that's the
 
05:21:19.610 --> 05:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
first a handout
 
05:21:22.610 --> 05:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
the second is from
 
05:21:24.410 --> 05:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
Kevin Williams
 
05:21:27.230 --> 05:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
he's a retired Immigration and Customs
 
05:21:27.240 --> 05:21:28.730 align:start position:0%
he's a retired Immigration and Customs
Enforcement

05:21:28.730 --> 05:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
Enforcement
 
05:21:31.610 --> 05:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
and removal operations officer he was
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
deployed as a deportation officer
 
05:21:37.368 --> 05:21:37.378 align:start position:0%
I have a show on public access called
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
chatting with Janine and I had Kevin
 
05:21:41.990 --> 05:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
Williams on the show and we talked about
 
05:21:44.270 --> 05:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
how he flew illegals around the country
 
05:21:46.190 --> 05:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
so it's not a myth it really does happen
 
05:21:48.830 --> 05:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
I have his testimony since he couldn't
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
be here today
 
05:21:52.910 --> 05:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
and then this one's the longest one I've
 
05:21:55.128 --> 05:21:55.138 align:start position:0%
become good friends with um
 
05:21:57.970 --> 05:21:57.980 align:start position:0%
Sherry oh thank you Tony
 
05:22:00.770 --> 05:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
Sherry's from the Federation of American
 
05:22:03.410 --> 05:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
Immigration reform
 
05:22:05.570 --> 05:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
this is lengthy it's double-sided it's
 
05:22:07.730 --> 05:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
about seven pages long so in the
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
interest of time I'm just going to go
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
over very quickly what she talks about
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
first she introduces herself she defines
 
05:22:14.750 --> 05:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
the organization what they're all about
 
05:22:17.448 --> 05:22:17.458 align:start position:0%
she says Sanctuary policies not only
 
05:22:19.970 --> 05:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
lead to more crimes but they are also a
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
magnet for illegal immigration
 
05:22:24.770 --> 05:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
she gives offers examples of crimes and
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%
murders committed by illegals
 
05:22:30.770 --> 05:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
she agrees that not everyone who is in
 
05:22:32.570 --> 05:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
the United States illegally intends to
 
05:22:35.330 --> 05:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
harm Americans but individuals who come
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
through the back doors have not been
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
vetted so their intentions are unknown
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
she has a lot of stats and information
 
05:22:44.650 --> 05:22:44.660 align:start position:0%
on um
 
05:22:46.368 --> 05:22:46.378 align:start position:0%
different crimes that have been
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
committed and why it is prudent to to
 
05:22:51.230 --> 05:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
pass a bill such as this
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
there are areas in New Hampshire that
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
have Sanctuary policies she cites those
 
05:22:59.030 --> 05:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
as well she says proponents of sanctuary
 
05:23:00.850 --> 05:23:00.860 align:start position:0%
policies argue that enacting
 
05:23:03.890 --> 05:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
anti-sanctuary legislation like sb-132
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
will result in public officials and Law
 
05:23:07.970 --> 05:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
Enforcement Officers discriminating
 
05:23:10.490 --> 05:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
against minorities however this issue
 
05:23:13.090 --> 05:23:13.100 align:start position:0%
has been addressed in the bill itself
 
05:23:15.410 --> 05:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
sb-132 specifically prohibits
 
05:23:17.510 --> 05:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination saying that a state or
 
05:23:19.368 --> 05:23:19.378 align:start position:0%
local government entity shall not
 
05:23:21.410 --> 05:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
consider an individual's race color
 
05:23:26.330 --> 05:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:26.340 --> 05:23:28.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:23:28.190 --> 05:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
I guess I I can wrap that up since in
 
05:23:31.850 --> 05:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
the interest of time
 
05:23:34.850 --> 05:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
um but I I do hope that you you have a
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
work session on this bill and read
 
05:23:39.170 --> 05:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
everything that I sent and the contact
 
05:23:42.288 --> 05:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
information for these individuals are on
 
05:23:44.208 --> 05:23:44.218 align:start position:0%
the paper and
 
05:23:46.850 --> 05:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
share are they the fair packet the third
 
05:23:46.860 --> 05:23:47.990 align:start position:0%
share are they the fair packet the third
page

05:23:47.990 --> 05:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
I mean the last page is is the second
 
05:23:51.530 --> 05:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
page I don't know how that happened so
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
there was a mix up in the the numbering
 
05:23:57.708 --> 05:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Nader are there
 
05:24:01.970 --> 05:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:24:05.448 --> 05:24:05.458 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
05:24:07.128 --> 05:24:07.138 align:start position:0%
okay here's where we're going to have
 
05:24:09.890 --> 05:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative power start the timers uh
 
05:24:13.610 --> 05:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
three minutes uh first up is uh
 
05:24:15.288 --> 05:24:15.298 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler who has said he
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:26.690 --> 05:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:24:29.208 --> 05:24:29.218 align:start position:0%
um I'm here as well first of all I'm
 
05:24:30.770 --> 05:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
Jonah wheeler from representing
 
05:24:34.368 --> 05:24:34.378 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 33 Peterborough and Sharon I'm
 
05:24:36.650 --> 05:24:36.660 align:start position:0%
here representing my town select board
 
05:24:41.570 --> 05:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
which on Tuesday voted 3-0 to sign a
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
petition in opposition to this
 
05:24:46.910 --> 05:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislation they did so not because they
 
05:24:49.448 --> 05:24:49.458 align:start position:0%
want open Borders or a bunch of
 
05:24:51.410 --> 05:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
undocumented people running around their
 
05:24:53.330 --> 05:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
town I don't think that's I think that's
 
05:24:54.830 --> 05:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
fear-mongering and I don't think that's
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
true they did so because they don't want
 
05:25:00.410 --> 05:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
their local police using their resources
 
05:25:02.510 --> 05:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
to enforce federal laws and I think that
 
05:25:04.690 --> 05:25:04.700 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable
 
05:25:08.690 --> 05:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
requests from the police in Peterborough
 
05:25:11.448 --> 05:25:11.458 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of undocumented people
 
05:25:14.690 --> 05:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and in the United
 
05:25:17.868 --> 05:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
States and I think
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
anyone would be mistaken to say that's
 
05:25:21.890 --> 05:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
not a problem we need comprehensive
 
05:25:23.990 --> 05:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
immigration reform and a pathway to
 
05:25:26.270 --> 05:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
citizenship so that those 11 million
 
05:25:29.090 --> 05:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
people 11 million plus people can find a
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
way to become legal
 
05:25:34.490 --> 05:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
but why are those 11 million people here
 
05:25:35.930 --> 05:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
in the United States
 
05:25:38.330 --> 05:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's not because there's some secret
 
05:25:41.810 --> 05:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
Invasion going on it's because in Africa
 
05:25:45.910 --> 05:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
southeast Asia and South America
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
corporations and American government and
 
05:25:52.730 --> 05:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
policy has subjected those countries and
 
05:25:54.590 --> 05:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
and those people to
 
05:25:58.010 --> 05:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
Decades of Terror they're living in
 
05:26:01.128 --> 05:26:01.138 align:start position:0%
apocalyptic conditions right now and I
 
05:26:02.330 --> 05:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
think we get a little bit too
 
05:26:03.890 --> 05:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
comfortable here in places like New
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we don't really understand
 
05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
how real it is for people across the
 
05:26:08.940 --> 05:26:10.070 align:start position:0%
how real it is for people across the
world

05:26:10.070 --> 05:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
world
 
05:26:10.080 --> 05:26:12.110 align:start position:0%
world
uh

05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:14.570 --> 05:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
these people are coming seeking refuge
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
and the only place that they feel is
 
05:26:20.448 --> 05:26:20.458 align:start position:0%
safe and I think we should be more
 
05:26:23.270 --> 05:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
focused on the fact that there are
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
places like that in this world right now
 
05:26:28.550 --> 05:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
instead of criminalizing them and taking
 
05:26:31.570 --> 05:26:31.580 align:start position:0%
away their autonomy without due process
 
05:26:33.770 --> 05:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
ice and the federal immigration
 
05:26:37.250 --> 05:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
authorities should enforce their loss we
 
05:26:38.810 --> 05:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
should have immigration laws we should
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
have a border a strong Border in which
 
05:26:43.730 --> 05:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
people cross legally
 
05:26:47.570 --> 05:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
but we don't get there by introducing
 
05:26:49.250 --> 05:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
legislation which would strip away
 
05:26:51.470 --> 05:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
people's due process rights even if they
 
05:26:54.410 --> 05:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
are here undocumented that is a
 
05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
restriction of freedom and I'm a little
 
05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
bit concerned by that so I see the pink
 
05:27:01.788 --> 05:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
card here I just want to introduce I
 
05:27:03.708 --> 05:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
just wanted to affirm peterborough's
 
05:27:06.350 --> 05:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
position here I'm not for open borders
 
05:27:09.410 --> 05:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
but I am for uh legal immigration and a
 
05:27:11.090 --> 05:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
pathway towards citizenship and this
 
05:27:12.410 --> 05:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
isn't the right way to move forward with
 
05:27:12.420 --> 05:27:13.250 align:start position:0%
isn't the right way to move forward with
that

05:27:13.250 --> 05:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:14.990 --> 05:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:27:17.990 --> 05:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh for those who will be coming up after
 
05:27:19.788 --> 05:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler I'm going to ask
 
05:27:21.770 --> 05:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
that not only do you maintain the
 
05:27:21.780 --> 05:27:22.910 align:start position:0%
that not only do you maintain the
three-minute

05:27:22.910 --> 05:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
three-minute
 
05:27:26.270 --> 05:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
um allotted time but also try to keep
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
your comments specifically to the bill
 
05:27:30.850 --> 05:27:30.860 align:start position:0%
at hand and that bill is sanctuary city
 
05:27:34.910 --> 05:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you next we have representative
 
05:28:01.368 --> 05:28:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.530 --> 05:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman turcotte and
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
05:28:07.368 --> 05:28:07.378 align:start position:0%
is representative Joe Shapiro
 
05:28:10.010 --> 05:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
representing Cheshire 16 and I'm come
 
05:28:11.990 --> 05:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
before you today to speak in opposition
 
05:28:16.788 --> 05:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
to SB 132. I think SB 132
 
05:28:16.798 --> 05:28:17.690 align:start position:0%
to SB 132. I think SB 132
um

05:28:17.690 --> 05:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:20.288 --> 05:28:20.298 align:start position:0%
is predicated on some major
 
05:28:22.730 --> 05:28:22.740 align:start position:0%
misconceptions and because of the time
 
05:28:25.010 --> 05:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
constraints here I'm going to try to
 
05:28:27.708 --> 05:28:27.718 align:start position:0%
address a couple of those
 
05:28:27.718 --> 05:28:28.368 align:start position:0%
address a couple of those
um

05:28:28.368 --> 05:28:28.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:30.770 --> 05:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
number one is that immigrants present a
 
05:28:33.410 --> 05:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
major problem in New Hampshire
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
um we have heard about
 
05:28:40.368 --> 05:28:40.378 align:start position:0%
um addictions and overdose fatalities in
 
05:28:42.530 --> 05:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I am the first to
 
05:28:44.750 --> 05:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
agree that that is a major problem I
 
05:28:46.128 --> 05:28:46.138 align:start position:0%
know that
 
05:28:46.138 --> 05:28:47.030 align:start position:0%
know that
um

05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:49.310 --> 05:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
much of those drugs come from out of
 
05:28:51.650 --> 05:28:51.660 align:start position:0%
this country but I don't think that this
 
05:28:53.690 --> 05:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
bill addresses that in the least we've
 
05:28:57.530 --> 05:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
also talked about heard about crime and
 
05:28:57.540 --> 05:28:58.670 align:start position:0%
also talked about heard about crime and
um

05:28:58.670 --> 05:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:01.670 --> 05:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
and dangerousness but we haven't heard
 
05:29:03.770 --> 05:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
any data from the northern border or
 
05:29:05.990 --> 05:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
from people coming elsewhere into New
 
05:29:07.730 --> 05:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we haven't even heard any
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
anecdotes about New Hampshire specific
 
05:29:14.750 --> 05:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
crime or violence
 
05:29:14.760 --> 05:29:15.948 align:start position:0%
crime or violence
um

05:29:15.948 --> 05:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:18.288 --> 05:29:18.298 align:start position:0%
in reality New Hampshire is consistently
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
rated within the top three states in the
 
05:29:22.128 --> 05:29:22.138 align:start position:0%
nation in regard to having the lowest
 
05:29:25.070 --> 05:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
rates of violent crime governor sununu
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
recently in his travels around the
 
05:29:28.850 --> 05:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
country is fond of saying that we live
 
05:29:31.490 --> 05:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
in the safest state in the country it is
 
05:29:33.410 --> 05:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
no secret that we have a woefully
 
05:29:36.110 --> 05:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
inadequate Workforce there are jobs for
 
05:29:38.530 --> 05:29:38.540 align:start position:0%
anybody who's able and wants to work
 
05:29:41.090 --> 05:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the claims that I
 
05:29:43.610 --> 05:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
think people make about immigrants
 
05:29:45.050 --> 05:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire that they will
 
05:29:46.970 --> 05:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
take the jobs and other benefits
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
reserved for residents
 
05:29:49.200 --> 05:29:51.288 align:start position:0%
reserved for residents
um

05:29:51.288 --> 05:29:51.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:53.330 --> 05:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
it is no secret that we have an
 
05:29:55.670 --> 05:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
inadequate Workforce
 
05:29:57.530 --> 05:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
um there are jobs for everybody who is
 
05:30:00.170 --> 05:30:00.180 align:start position:0%
able and wants to work I recently had a
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
conversation with the vice president at
 
05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
um pitco friellator which is a Concord
 
05:30:07.390 --> 05:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
company which makes commercial
 
05:30:10.128 --> 05:30:10.138 align:start position:0%
friolators for McDonald's all over the
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
all over the world and for other
 
05:30:14.690 --> 05:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
restaurants as well he talked to me
 
05:30:14.700 --> 05:30:16.550 align:start position:0%
restaurants as well he talked to me
about

05:30:16.550 --> 05:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:30:19.850 --> 05:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
um with covid the lack of people
 
05:30:21.530 --> 05:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
applying for jobs and the number of
 
05:30:24.288 --> 05:30:24.298 align:start position:0%
people leaving and there are problems
 
05:30:27.170 --> 05:30:27.180 align:start position:0%
with producing their product
 
05:30:29.448 --> 05:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
and that somebody had convinced him to
 
05:30:33.350 --> 05:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
hire four recent Afghan evacuees who had
 
05:30:35.208 --> 05:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
moved to Concord
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
um and he was unsure of that because of
 
05:30:39.708 --> 05:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
language problems but he hired these
 
05:30:43.250 --> 05:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
four people last spring and when I spoke
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
to him in the winter he had 40 Afghan
 
05:30:47.520 --> 05:30:48.470 align:start position:0%
to him in the winter he had 40 Afghan
um

05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:51.530 --> 05:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
he had 40 Afghans working there and he
 
05:30:53.090 --> 05:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
felt that it had really saved his
 
05:30:53.100 --> 05:30:56.030 align:start position:0%
felt that it had really saved his
Workforce

05:30:56.030 --> 05:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:57.288 --> 05:30:57.298 align:start position:0%
um okay I'm gonna have to move along
 
05:30:59.208 --> 05:30:59.218 align:start position:0%
because I see the pink card
 
05:30:59.218 --> 05:31:02.288 align:start position:0%
because I see the pink card
um

05:31:02.288 --> 05:31:02.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:05.150 --> 05:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
so why if this bill is so problematic
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary we even hear today
 
05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
discussing it not just today but year
 
05:31:12.590 --> 05:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
after year as was said before this isn't
 
05:31:14.570 --> 05:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
is not an example of the New Hampshire
 
05:31:16.850 --> 05:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
citizen legislature trying to solve a
 
05:31:18.650 --> 05:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire problem brought To Us by
 
05:31:21.470 --> 05:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
our constituents rather we are porns in
 
05:31:23.990 --> 05:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
a national funded campaign
 
05:31:26.150 --> 05:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
by a national immigrant an
 
05:31:28.190 --> 05:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
anti-immigrant organization which seeks
 
05:31:29.930 --> 05:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
to demonize people who speak different
 
05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
language than us may be a different
 
05:31:34.128 --> 05:31:34.138 align:start position:0%
color than us and may practice a
 
05:31:36.650 --> 05:31:36.660 align:start position:0%
different religion than us immigrants
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire will not in
 
05:31:40.910 --> 05:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
itself solve the problems of an aging
 
05:31:43.550 --> 05:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
state with inadequate Workforce but
 
05:31:45.590 --> 05:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
please do not pass a bill that will in
 
05:31:47.530 --> 05:31:47.540 align:start position:0%
effect put up a sign at the borders
 
05:31:50.690 --> 05:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
saying you are not welcome here
 
05:31:53.628 --> 05:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
today I urge you to do two things first
 
05:31:56.090 --> 05:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
to go to your communities and introduce
 
05:31:58.490 --> 05:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
yourself to the newcomers who this bill
 
05:32:00.110 --> 05:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
will affect
 
05:32:02.750 --> 05:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
hear their stories find out about their
 
05:32:05.288 --> 05:32:05.298 align:start position:0%
families listen to their aspirations
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
second truly protect New Hampshire
 
05:32:12.590 --> 05:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
communities by voting itl on SB 132.
 
05:32:14.208 --> 05:32:14.218 align:start position:0%
good thank you for your testimony any
 
05:32:14.218 --> 05:32:16.190 align:start position:0%
good thank you for your testimony any
questions

05:32:16.190 --> 05:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:32:18.590 --> 05:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you uh next up we
 
05:32:32.510 --> 05:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm representative
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan from Stratford County
 
05:32:38.090 --> 05:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
District 10. I I'm used to being
 
05:32:39.890 --> 05:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
District six but I'm Different 10. the
 
05:32:42.110 --> 05:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
town of Durham I'm also a member of the
 
05:32:44.810 --> 05:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
Stratford county executive committee and
 
05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so one thing I'll mention is our
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
County administers a
 
05:32:51.530 --> 05:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
contract with the Federal Bureau of
 
05:32:53.690 --> 05:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
Prisons for taking in federal prisoners
 
05:32:56.050 --> 05:32:56.060 align:start position:0%
including immigration detainees and I'm
 
05:32:58.610 --> 05:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
concerned that some of the language
 
05:33:00.470 --> 05:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
about polishing Sanctuary policy would
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
interfere with the County Jail's ability
 
05:33:06.410 --> 05:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
to uh you know deal with the detainees
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
humanely which they make every effort to
 
05:33:08.400 --> 05:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
humanely which they make every effort to
do

05:33:09.830 --> 05:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:33:13.190 --> 05:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
um because often oftentimes when you
 
05:33:16.010 --> 05:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
have an immigration detainee they maybe
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
intending to apply for Asylum but we
 
05:33:20.090 --> 05:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
haven't accepted the same as Asylum or
 
05:33:22.010 --> 05:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
their visas run out or there's all kinds
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
of things occasionally they even take a
 
05:33:26.750 --> 05:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
citizen who maybe doesn't speak English
 
05:33:30.110 --> 05:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
well or just looks different and hauls
 
05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
them in
 
05:33:36.590 --> 05:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
also the number of also the uh I guess a
 
05:33:38.448 --> 05:33:38.458 align:start position:0%
number of uh undocumented immigrants
 
05:33:40.190 --> 05:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's probably not going to obviously
 
05:33:42.890 --> 05:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
we've destabilized Africa and Latin
 
05:33:44.570 --> 05:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
America as represented wheeler aptly
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
said but we also have a a war in Eastern
 
05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
Europe so that's creating a large number
 
05:33:53.990 --> 05:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
of uh you know displaced people some of
 
05:33:55.970 --> 05:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
whom are coming to America who are you
 
05:33:55.980 --> 05:33:56.628 align:start position:0%
whom are coming to America who are you
know

05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:33:58.850 --> 05:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
look like me blonde haired in blue eyes
 
05:34:00.530 --> 05:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
you know Russians ukrainians and so
 
05:34:02.448 --> 05:34:02.458 align:start position:0%
forth so it's not just people of color
 
05:34:02.458 --> 05:34:03.530 align:start position:0%
forth so it's not just people of color
who

05:34:03.530 --> 05:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:34:05.868 --> 05:34:05.878 align:start position:0%
are being who are coming to the coming
 
05:34:08.510 --> 05:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
to this country looking for uh Sanctuary
 
05:34:10.010 --> 05:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
or Asylum
 
05:34:10.020 --> 05:34:11.330 align:start position:0%
or Asylum
um

05:34:11.330 --> 05:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:14.208 --> 05:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
and uh and the title as I said is
 
05:34:15.770 --> 05:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
misleading it applies to all state
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
entities um it really we're not a home
 
05:34:20.030 --> 05:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
real estate it's a really really even be
 
05:34:21.530 --> 05:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
possible to
 
05:34:23.628 --> 05:34:23.638 align:start position:0%
single out Sanctuary cities and towns
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
because their powers are all come from
 
05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh come from the state and so fact the
 
05:34:30.590 --> 05:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
discovers the whole state not that
 
05:34:32.930 --> 05:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
there's much possibility of a New
 
05:34:34.550 --> 05:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire declaring itself a sanctuary
 
05:34:36.470 --> 05:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
State I think that bill would go down in
 
05:34:37.670 --> 05:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
flames although I've considered
 
05:34:39.530 --> 05:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
introducing it
 
05:34:42.410 --> 05:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:34:44.330 --> 05:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
so there's like a lot of things I mean
 
05:34:45.948 --> 05:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned the fentanyl trade I
 
05:34:47.628 --> 05:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
know much time to go into it but in fact
 
05:34:49.850 --> 05:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
it's uh personally not being smuggled in
 
05:34:51.770 --> 05:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
by by immigrants it's being smuggled in
 
05:34:54.890 --> 05:34:54.900 align:start position:0%
by cargo the fentanyl trade is extremely
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh sophisticated high-tech operation and
 
05:35:00.170 --> 05:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh you know it involves uh people here
 
05:35:02.690 --> 05:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
in the U.S not just people in China and
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
other countries so and
 
05:35:07.250 --> 05:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
finally there's a conundrum in this bill
 
05:35:09.110 --> 05:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
which is on the one hand
 
05:35:12.350 --> 05:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement agencies are not
 
05:35:12.360 --> 05:35:13.610 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement agencies are not
allowed

05:35:13.610 --> 05:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
05:35:16.730 --> 05:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
to refuse to interfere with uh
 
05:35:16.740 --> 05:35:18.910 align:start position:0%
to refuse to interfere with uh
Federal

05:35:18.910 --> 05:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
05:35:21.170 --> 05:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
immigration policy but the other hand
 
05:35:23.090 --> 05:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
they're they're not allowed to cooperate
 
05:35:25.970 --> 05:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
with Federal Gun policy
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
and he just know if we pass this bill
 
05:35:29.390 --> 05:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
pretty soon
 
05:35:32.510 --> 05:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
a uh a citizen of another country is
 
05:35:34.850 --> 05:35:34.860 align:start position:0%
going to be arrested on gun charges and
 
05:35:36.650 --> 05:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to be
 
05:35:38.090 --> 05:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to have like a logical
 
05:35:39.530 --> 05:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
conundrum we're going to be sort of
 
05:35:41.208 --> 05:35:41.218 align:start position:0%
going around an infinite Circle deciding
 
05:35:43.070 --> 05:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
05:35:44.930 --> 05:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
how we're supposed to respond to that so
 
05:35:46.910 --> 05:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
05:35:50.448 --> 05:35:50.458 align:start position:0%
so so I think those two so I think so I
 
05:35:52.430 --> 05:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
think those two bills are are so those
 
05:35:54.350 --> 05:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
two laws are incompatible so you're just
 
05:35:56.448 --> 05:35:56.458 align:start position:0%
going to very quickly put our uh
 
05:35:57.948 --> 05:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
authorities in an impossible position
 
05:35:59.930 --> 05:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
the first time you have a situation like
 
05:36:02.690 --> 05:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
that and they're absolutely will be one
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
because uh you know citizens and
 
05:36:07.070 --> 05:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
non-citizens like commit all sorts of
 
05:36:09.050 --> 05:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
sorts of crimes immigrants not
 
05:36:11.330 --> 05:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
necessarily more than uh citizens but
 
05:36:13.730 --> 05:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
they said including Firearms crimes so
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
you get an immigrant with the illegal
 
05:36:17.330 --> 05:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
firearm what are you going to do about
 
05:36:20.208 --> 05:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
that I I don't know so
 
05:36:21.890 --> 05:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so thanks I think this is a bad Bill
 
05:36:24.530 --> 05:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
so itl thanks thank you very much any
 
05:36:24.540 --> 05:36:26.590 align:start position:0%
so itl thanks thank you very much any
questions

05:36:26.590 --> 05:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:36:30.050 --> 05:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks
 
05:36:33.890 --> 05:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
um next we have I can't quite make out
 
05:36:37.368 --> 05:36:37.378 align:start position:0%
the last name Alan aldubus
 
05:36:40.430 --> 05:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
okay that's true
 
05:36:43.310 --> 05:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
05:36:51.288 --> 05:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:53.150 --> 05:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman turcott and
 
05:36:54.770 --> 05:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Alan
 
05:36:56.090 --> 05:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
aldenberg and I am the chief of police
 
05:36:58.430 --> 05:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
for the Manchester Police Department
 
05:36:59.810 --> 05:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
05:37:02.090 --> 05:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 132 and act prohibiting
 
05:37:03.948 --> 05:37:03.958 align:start position:0%
cities and towns from adopting Sanctuary
 
05:37:03.958 --> 05:37:05.150 align:start position:0%
cities and towns from adopting Sanctuary
policies

05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
policies
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
as the chief of police in the LA in the
 
05:37:08.628 --> 05:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
state's largest and most diverse City
 
05:37:10.730 --> 05:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned with this bill and I
 
05:37:12.170 --> 05:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you find it in
 
05:37:14.750 --> 05:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate Public Safety is
 
05:37:17.090 --> 05:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
always my top concern in thoughtful
 
05:37:19.310 --> 05:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
policy is a significant factor in the
 
05:37:21.770 --> 05:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security of our communities
 
05:37:24.530 --> 05:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
I feel that Senate Bill 132 would be
 
05:37:26.330 --> 05:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the trust between the
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
police and the community
 
05:37:29.690 --> 05:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
he would have dire consequences for
 
05:37:32.570 --> 05:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
victims of crime and it appears to aim
 
05:37:34.010 --> 05:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
to change current policies that have
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
proven to be effective
 
05:37:38.208 --> 05:37:38.218 align:start position:0%
additionally prior testimony was offered
 
05:37:39.890 --> 05:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
from a retired ice agent in another
 
05:37:39.900 --> 05:37:40.970 align:start position:0%
from a retired ice agent in another
committee

05:37:40.970 --> 05:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:37:42.530 --> 05:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
I believe it's the Kevin Williams that
 
05:37:44.330 --> 05:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier who stated that
 
05:37:45.770 --> 05:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
the Manchester police department and
 
05:37:47.868 --> 05:37:47.878 align:start position:0%
other law enforcement agency agencies in
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
the state do not cooperate with the
 
05:37:51.650 --> 05:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
United States immigration and customers
 
05:37:54.110 --> 05:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement that testimony is patently
 
05:37:57.590 --> 05:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
false and irresponsible to stay publicly
 
05:37:59.330 --> 05:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
I'll outline precisely how the
 
05:38:00.770 --> 05:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department manages
 
05:38:02.390 --> 05:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
interactions with undocumented
 
05:38:04.850 --> 05:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
immigrants to begin the Manchester
 
05:38:06.350 --> 05:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
police department works daily to gain
 
05:38:08.690 --> 05:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
and maintain the trust of those we serve
 
05:38:10.730 --> 05:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
and furtherance of this goal we have
 
05:38:12.650 --> 05:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
developed a model policy that balances
 
05:38:14.530 --> 05:38:14.540 align:start position:0%
the need to ensure safety of all
 
05:38:16.670 --> 05:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of their immigration status
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
we have and currently cooperate with our
 
05:38:20.330 --> 05:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
federal immigration Partners on
 
05:38:22.850 --> 05:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
violations of immigration laws our
 
05:38:25.970 --> 05:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
policy has been in place since 2011.
 
05:38:27.650 --> 05:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
to ensure the community trusts the
 
05:38:29.690 --> 05:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
police we don't we do not ask about
 
05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
their immigration status when they are
 
05:38:33.708 --> 05:38:33.718 align:start position:0%
the victim a witness of a crime or a
 
05:38:35.690 --> 05:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
juvenile we also do not inquire about
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
immigration status during a routine
 
05:38:39.770 --> 05:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle Stop Those seeking medical
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
attention or victims of domestic
 
05:38:41.760 --> 05:38:42.890 align:start position:0%
attention or victims of domestic
violence

05:38:42.890 --> 05:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
violence
 
05:38:44.990 --> 05:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is an important policy decision to
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
ensure our community knows that they can
 
05:38:49.250 --> 05:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
come to the police for help with without
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
the threat of being deported
 
05:38:54.050 --> 05:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
we should not be adopting policies and
 
05:38:55.610 --> 05:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
laws that could potentially deter
 
05:38:57.288 --> 05:38:57.298 align:start position:0%
victims of crime from reporting their
 
05:38:59.208 --> 05:38:59.218 align:start position:0%
victimization to the police
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
doing so causes a cycle of violence to
 
05:39:04.430 --> 05:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
continue particularly in domestic
 
05:39:05.930 --> 05:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
violence situations
 
05:39:08.090 --> 05:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
this also opens the door for predators
 
05:39:10.730 --> 05:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
to exploit undocumented individuals due
 
05:39:12.470 --> 05:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
to the less risk of being reported to
 
05:39:13.430 --> 05:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
the police
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
examples could be human trafficking or
 
05:39:17.570 --> 05:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
labor law violations
 
05:39:19.610 --> 05:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
our policy already ensures that we work
 
05:39:21.230 --> 05:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
with Federal immigration Partners when
 
05:39:23.868 --> 05:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate for example should an
 
05:39:25.788 --> 05:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
officer believe a person under arrest is
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
an undocumented immigrant the officer
 
05:39:30.530 --> 05:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
can notify ice for consideration of an
 
05:39:32.990 --> 05:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
immigration hold when the person was
 
05:39:35.330 --> 05:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
arrested for a felony was arrested for a
 
05:39:37.610 --> 05:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor crime of violence or a
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that poses a threat to
 
05:39:40.430 --> 05:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
Public Safety
 
05:39:42.770 --> 05:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
they were or they were previously
 
05:39:44.810 --> 05:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
deported immigrant or the person was
 
05:39:46.788 --> 05:39:46.798 align:start position:0%
actively wanted by ice for immigration
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
law violations
 
05:39:51.410 --> 05:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
and this does happen we do call ice in
 
05:39:53.390 --> 05:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
these circumstances most often when the
 
05:39:55.550 --> 05:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
person is wanted by ice and the warrant
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
is entered into the national criminal
 
05:39:59.930 --> 05:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
information center also known as ncic
 
05:40:01.970 --> 05:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
the reality and to be frank with you
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes ice declines to come in
 
05:40:07.970 --> 05:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
order to take custody of the individual
 
05:40:10.250 --> 05:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
the Manchester Police Department policy
 
05:40:11.628 --> 05:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
has become a model for other police
 
05:40:13.910 --> 05:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
departments because it works this
 
05:40:16.128 --> 05:40:16.138 align:start position:0%
balance of this policy the balance of
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
this policy is the best approach to the
 
05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
Departments because it works
 
05:40:23.090 --> 05:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
Senate one Senate Bill 132 was not
 
05:40:25.070 --> 05:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
needed it does not fix a problem or
 
05:40:26.990 --> 05:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
right or wrong it would only hamper our
 
05:40:29.510 --> 05:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
ability to Serve and Protect again I ask
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
that you find Senate Bill 132 in
 
05:40:33.288 --> 05:40:33.298 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
05:40:34.788 --> 05:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
05:40:37.128 --> 05:40:37.138 align:start position:0%
representative Keller
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking the question
 
05:40:42.350 --> 05:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
um in Reading
 
05:40:42.360 --> 05:40:43.150 align:start position:0%
um in Reading
um

05:40:43.150 --> 05:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:49.910 --> 05:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
Roman 5 uh page on page two line 17.
 
05:40:53.390 --> 05:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
um it seems to say that
 
05:40:55.610 --> 05:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
um The Sanctuary policy that they're
 
05:41:00.050 --> 05:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
talking about is essentially forbidding
 
05:41:00.060 --> 05:41:00.708 align:start position:0%
talking about is essentially forbidding
um

05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
any cooperation with
 
05:41:06.350 --> 05:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
um enforcement of federal law
 
05:41:08.750 --> 05:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
 
05:41:08.760 --> 05:41:09.830 align:start position:0%
immigration laws
um

05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:11.810 --> 05:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
would your
 
05:41:15.230 --> 05:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
and you stated before that someone was
 
05:41:17.270 --> 05:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
saying that you are
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
um would not be in compliance with this
 
05:41:21.650 --> 05:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
but you just stated that in certain
 
05:41:24.650 --> 05:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
circumstances you do comply or you do
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
cooperate and so therefore in fact it
 
05:41:31.190 --> 05:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any policy change to your
 
05:41:33.230 --> 05:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
department right because you do
 
05:41:35.690 --> 05:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
cooperate sometimes and other times you
 
05:41:38.030 --> 05:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
choose not to and so therefore you
 
05:41:41.270 --> 05:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a a sanctuary policy that
 
05:41:44.270 --> 05:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
says you never cooperate is is that your
 
05:41:48.110 --> 05:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of of this
 
05:41:49.850 --> 05:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
um law and how
 
05:41:52.310 --> 05:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
what page you want again I'm on page two
 
05:41:55.128 --> 05:41:55.138 align:start position:0%
the sanctuary policy yes sir
 
05:41:57.530 --> 05:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
um you said before that that you were
 
05:41:59.570 --> 05:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
someone claimed that you had a sanctuary
 
05:42:02.690 --> 05:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
policy but you just stated that
 
05:42:04.730 --> 05:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
there are certain times which you would
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
be cooperating and so then you wouldn't
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
be in violation of of this having a
 
05:42:12.470 --> 05:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy correct correct but I'm
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm concerned too about
 
05:42:16.970 --> 05:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
um you know who
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
asking law enforcement to local law
 
05:42:22.970 --> 05:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement to enforce essentially a a
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
civil action on part of the federal
 
05:42:28.368 --> 05:42:28.378 align:start position:0%
authorities to me is problematic because
 
05:42:31.190 --> 05:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes those
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
those detention orders that may be in
 
05:42:36.410 --> 05:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
existence are not accurate
 
05:42:38.570 --> 05:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
um they're sometimes not rooted in
 
05:42:40.730 --> 05:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
05:42:43.128 --> 05:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
sometimes there there's sometimes many
 
05:42:45.350 --> 05:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
mistakes with those and to put local law
 
05:42:47.570 --> 05:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
enforcement in that position
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
um I think is is dangerous it's a
 
05:42:52.970 --> 05:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
slippery slope and
 
05:42:54.770 --> 05:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
not only am I going to erode the trust
 
05:42:57.530 --> 05:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
I don't have the people for that to be
 
05:43:01.670 --> 05:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
honest with you to be going out and
 
05:43:03.890 --> 05:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
enforcing the work of the federal
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
immigration authorities it's not that's
 
05:43:08.208 --> 05:43:08.218 align:start position:0%
their job to do that we assist we're
 
05:43:10.368 --> 05:43:10.378 align:start position:0%
appropriate and when asked hopefully
 
05:43:13.368 --> 05:43:13.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:15.708 --> 05:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
I think uh representative Guthrie here's
 
05:43:18.050 --> 05:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
a quick question thank you Mr chairman
 
05:43:20.590 --> 05:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you chief for your your
 
05:43:23.090 --> 05:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
testimony I think it's
 
05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
gives a real good look at what's going
 
05:43:27.810 --> 05:43:27.820 align:start position:0%
on with this bill
 
05:43:27.820 --> 05:43:29.208 align:start position:0%
on with this bill
[Music]

05:43:29.208 --> 05:43:29.218 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:43:32.868 --> 05:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that you don't need
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
this bill I think you and the previous
 
05:43:38.270 --> 05:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
speakers have said that this bill is not
 
05:43:38.280 --> 05:43:39.288 align:start position:0%
speakers have said that this bill is not
needed

05:43:39.288 --> 05:43:39.298 align:start position:0%
needed
 
05:43:41.448 --> 05:43:41.458 align:start position:0%
it's not a tool that you could you would
 
05:43:44.330 --> 05:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
use it's not a tool that's in the best
 
05:43:45.770 --> 05:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
interest of the State of New Hampshire
 
05:43:48.650 --> 05:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
is that Fayette or is that a
 
05:43:50.990 --> 05:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of your testimony
 
05:43:53.090 --> 05:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
chief that is fair and I will also
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that do we have a problem at
 
05:43:56.150 --> 05:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
our borders
 
05:43:56.160 --> 05:43:57.948 align:start position:0%
our borders
100

05:43:57.948 --> 05:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
100
 
05:44:00.048 --> 05:44:00.058 align:start position:0%
um but this isn't gonna
 
05:44:02.150 --> 05:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to affix that that's an
 
05:44:04.970 --> 05:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
that's a global problem thank you chief
 
05:44:07.788 --> 05:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you Mr Gia
 
05:44:10.548 --> 05:44:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman afternoon Chief
 
05:44:14.750 --> 05:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
just I'm right here I'm sorry it's okay
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
there's a glare I apologize
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative that's all right I just
 
05:44:19.610 --> 05:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
got a quick question for you kind of a
 
05:44:22.250 --> 05:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
scenario uh one of your officer stops
 
05:44:25.010 --> 05:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
the cough arrests the person for class A
 
05:44:28.610 --> 05:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor go into you want to 10 21 22
 
05:44:31.970 --> 05:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
or 23 comes up as a hit that there's a
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
detention on it from uh immigration
 
05:44:36.170 --> 05:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do what's it
 
05:44:37.548 --> 05:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
officer going to do
 
05:44:39.288 --> 05:44:39.298 align:start position:0%
what happens then is the you're going to
 
05:44:40.788 --> 05:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
call the immigration folks it could be
 
05:44:41.810 --> 05:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
two o'clock in the morning and we'll
 
05:44:44.208 --> 05:44:44.218 align:start position:0%
call the on-call number for ice
 
05:44:46.730 --> 05:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
um in the vast majority of time
 
05:44:48.288 --> 05:44:48.298 align:start position:0%
um if we're being honest
 
05:44:50.448 --> 05:44:50.458 align:start position:0%
um we don't get an answer
 
05:44:51.530 --> 05:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
um or
 
05:44:53.448 --> 05:44:53.458 align:start position:0%
they'll answer and say okay thank you
 
05:44:55.010 --> 05:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
for letting us know
 
05:44:56.390 --> 05:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
um We'll advise them of the reason the
 
05:44:59.690 --> 05:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
person's under arrest and
 
05:45:02.208 --> 05:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
person will be bailed out and released
 
05:45:04.910 --> 05:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
on your misdemeanor charge correct okay
 
05:45:06.830 --> 05:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:06.840 --> 05:45:08.448 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

05:45:08.448 --> 05:45:08.458 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:45:10.730 --> 05:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good afternoon
 
05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
Chief good afternoon representative my
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
question is you're you're calling the
 
05:45:18.190 --> 05:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
detainer a civil matter
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
so when you go into ncic the detainer
 
05:45:24.890 --> 05:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up under that database
 
05:45:28.010 --> 05:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
correct it will it can yes
 
05:45:28.020 --> 05:45:29.390 align:start position:0%
correct it will it can yes
yep

05:45:29.390 --> 05:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there's maybe an attorney
 
05:45:32.330 --> 05:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
in the room could probably entrust that
 
05:45:35.570 --> 05:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
better but um it will show up in ncic
 
05:45:38.570 --> 05:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
okay and usually it's a hold or you know
 
05:45:40.548 --> 05:45:40.558 align:start position:0%
hold contact ice
 
05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of times it could just be a
 
05:45:45.410 --> 05:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's a hit on a similar sounding name
 
05:45:46.970 --> 05:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
um so you got to vet that out we call
 
05:45:48.350 --> 05:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
that a soundex
 
05:45:48.360 --> 05:45:49.070 align:start position:0%
that a soundex
um

05:45:49.070 --> 05:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
but yeah something will generally pop up
 
05:45:52.850 --> 05:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
in ncic
 
05:45:56.330 --> 05:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up please go ahead
 
05:46:00.590 --> 05:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
can can you cite where in this bill you
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
dates that law enforcement
 
05:46:06.470 --> 05:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
does something that you're you're
 
05:46:09.170 --> 05:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah what I'm opposed to is asking
 
05:46:14.570 --> 05:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
local authorities to get into the
 
05:46:16.490 --> 05:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
business of enforcing Federal
 
05:46:19.788 --> 05:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
immigration laws that's what I'm in
 
05:46:21.170 --> 05:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
05:46:22.850 --> 05:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
you know how's it going to look right
 
05:46:24.890 --> 05:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
let's simplify it how's it going to look
 
05:46:27.230 --> 05:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
that hey now the local police are acting
 
05:46:29.868 --> 05:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
as under the guise of as ICE federal
 
05:46:32.510 --> 05:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
agents in going out and you know now
 
05:46:34.128 --> 05:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
asking people though immigration status
 
05:46:35.868 --> 05:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
and now
 
05:46:37.610 --> 05:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
um now they want us knocking on doors
 
05:46:40.128 --> 05:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
and I mean I I'm just I can see where
 
05:46:41.628 --> 05:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
this is going and maybe not state that
 
05:46:43.070 --> 05:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
directly in there
 
05:46:44.810 --> 05:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
um but those are my concerns with the
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
local at the local level I want to
 
05:46:49.190 --> 05:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
maintain trust with everybody in my
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
community I want to make sure that when
 
05:46:53.330 --> 05:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
somebody's a victim of a crime that they
 
05:46:55.190 --> 05:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable coming forward
 
05:46:57.048 --> 05:46:57.058 align:start position:0%
in doing so that they're going to be
 
05:46:58.368 --> 05:46:58.378 align:start position:0%
treated appropriately
 
05:46:59.930 --> 05:46:59.940 align:start position:0%

specifically in the language of this
 
05:47:24.890 --> 05:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
bill what line does it state that local

20.

05:47:38.810 --> 05:47:38.820 align:start position:0%

05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%

that's my understanding of it maybe
 
05:48:50.750 --> 05:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm misinterpreting the language
 
05:48:54.410 --> 05:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
um so I'm open to having that discussion
 
05:48:54.420 --> 05:48:55.128 align:start position:0%

I would agree that that's not what this
 
05:49:05.868 --> 05:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
this language in the bill says okay this
 
05:49:08.570 --> 05:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:13.548 --> 05:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary policy being adopted it has to
 
05:49:17.208 --> 05:49:17.218 align:start position:0%
me nothing to do with enforcing federal
 
05:49:20.090 --> 05:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
law but additionally I would like to
 
05:49:22.250 --> 05:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
understand you you made some reference
 
05:49:24.410 --> 05:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
to going out and asking immigration
 
05:49:28.430 --> 05:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
status again of local law enforcement
 
05:49:29.930 --> 05:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this bill would
 
05:49:31.910 --> 05:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
require local law enforce enforcement
 
05:49:33.708 --> 05:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
let's say a required but I kind of worry
 
05:49:35.868 --> 05:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
about what's next
 
05:49:37.850 --> 05:49:37.860 align:start position:0%

05:50:09.948 --> 05:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
previously asked about the per the the
 
05:50:13.070 --> 05:50:13.080 align:start position:0%

05:50:15.470 --> 05:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
um enact issue adopt pulmon great and
 
05:50:18.890 --> 05:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
force permit I was focused on the permit
 
05:50:22.610 --> 05:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
um language and then following up the
 
05:50:25.128 --> 05:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy
 
05:50:30.910 --> 05:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
um defy or uh the policy on line 15
 
05:50:33.650 --> 05:50:33.660 align:start position:0%
talks about how you might have a
 
05:50:36.350 --> 05:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
practice or a custom
 
05:50:36.360 --> 05:50:37.868 align:start position:0%
practice or a custom
of

05:50:37.868 --> 05:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:50:40.868 --> 05:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
05:50:43.910 --> 05:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
doing some cooperation
 
05:50:46.910 --> 05:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
um and we talked a little bit about how
 
05:50:49.850 --> 05:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
you may be understaffed or or different
 
05:50:52.970 --> 05:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities within this state may be
 
05:50:56.208 --> 05:50:56.218 align:start position:0%
understaffed and may have an Unwritten
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
practice of not creating an extra work
 
05:51:00.770 --> 05:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
for themselves
 
05:51:03.948 --> 05:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
um by by uh
 
05:51:06.830 --> 05:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
quote unquote cooperating
 
05:51:06.840 --> 05:51:07.670 align:start position:0%
quote unquote cooperating
um

05:51:07.670 --> 05:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:11.510 --> 05:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that this if you were under
 
05:51:14.270 --> 05:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
staff that you might prioritize
 
05:51:17.690 --> 05:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
some some other aspect of of the law
 
05:51:19.490 --> 05:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement and not
 
05:51:22.010 --> 05:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
um uh you know you may not have a
 
05:51:23.448 --> 05:51:23.458 align:start position:0%
written policy that says we're not going
 
05:51:25.610 --> 05:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
to do this anymore but for a certain
 
05:51:27.410 --> 05:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
amount of time you may have a practice
 
05:51:29.510 --> 05:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
of not doing that because of the
 
05:51:32.750 --> 05:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
Staffing shortages and you might be
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
prioritizing other part of your duties
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
that could be applicable in many things
 
05:51:40.850 --> 05:51:40.860 align:start position:0%

enshrined principle that New Hampshire
 
05:54:00.650 --> 05:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
generally does not take orders from the

firearms however on the other side of
 
05:54:32.030 --> 05:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
the coin the Senate just passed house
 
05:54:37.448 --> 05:54:37.458 align:start position:0%
bills 132. FM which mandates us to um
 
05:54:39.470 --> 05:54:39.480 align:start position:0%

the federal government
 
05:54:51.530 --> 05:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
on the other hand the Senate wants to
 
05:54:53.208 --> 05:54:53.218 align:start position:0%
mandate me to do something I'm not
 
05:54:55.368 --> 05:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
federally mandated to do namely enforce

law or not
 
05:55:11.990 --> 05:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
you probably know about most New

state

05:55:28.910 --> 05:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:55:31.190 --> 05:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
you allow us law enforcement throughout
 
05:55:32.330 --> 05:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
the city of New Hampshire to have
 
05:55:35.208 --> 05:55:35.218 align:start position:0%
discretion in the decision making we are
 
05:55:36.890 --> 05:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
the ones out on the community and know
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
our residents the best
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah legislation is passing bail reform
 
05:55:43.548 --> 05:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
laws and minimize the holding of people
 
05:55:45.410 --> 05:55:45.420 align:start position:0%

05:55:49.010 --> 05:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
some in the legislation wants us to
 
05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
enforce immigration detainers not issued
 
05:55:53.150 --> 05:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
by a judge
 
05:55:54.770 --> 05:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
embedding this bill is another problem
 
05:55:57.170 --> 05:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
in the harm that will the harm
 
05:55:59.208 --> 05:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
that immigrants will fear whenever they
 
05:56:00.470 --> 05:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
want to engage with local law
 
05:56:05.930 --> 05:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:09.288 --> 05:56:09.298 align:start position:0%
according to Jill
 
05:56:11.570 --> 05:56:11.580 align:start position:0%

quickly please thank you absolutely
 
05:56:18.350 --> 05:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
um 97 90 of the drugs are actually
 
05:56:20.230 --> 05:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
coming through our legal ports of Entry
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
86 percent by American citizens is not
 
05:56:25.490 --> 05:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
the person backpacking through our
 
05:56:28.128 --> 05:56:28.138 align:start position:0%
borders trying to have a better life and
 
05:56:31.368 --> 05:56:31.378 align:start position:0%
and fear for their own countries and I'm
 
05:56:34.490 --> 05:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
looking for the lived American dream I
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
do have my testimony in writing so I'll

pass them along and have the complete of
 
05:56:41.708 --> 05:56:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:44.510 --> 05:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Elwood
 
05:56:47.030 --> 05:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:56:47.040 --> 05:56:50.510 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman

05:56:54.048 --> 05:56:54.058 align:start position:0%
Sheriff Rivera correct can you tell me
 
05:56:57.048 --> 05:56:57.058 align:start position:0%
how fear of being deported
 
05:57:01.490 --> 05:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
gives a removable alien a pass
 
05:57:04.128 --> 05:57:04.138 align:start position:0%
for being in the country
 
05:57:04.138 --> 05:57:06.650 align:start position:0%
for being in the country
illegally

05:57:06.650 --> 05:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
05:57:09.530 --> 05:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
fear of being deported gives an illegal
 
05:57:12.110 --> 05:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
and how does an undocumented person
 
05:57:15.590 --> 05:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
right I was using your word sir how is
 
05:57:17.690 --> 05:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
fear you you mentioned fear of being
 
05:57:21.350 --> 05:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
deported as a reason for not passing
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
this bill and I asked how does that
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
equate to allowing a removable alien
 
05:57:31.490 --> 05:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
which is also in this bill
 
05:57:31.500 --> 05:57:32.448 align:start position:0%
which is also in this bill
um

05:57:32.448 --> 05:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:34.548 --> 05:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
give them a free pass to be in our
 
05:57:37.730 --> 05:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
country it's not a matter of a free free
 
05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
pass it's um the matter of reporting
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
when they've been victims of crime when
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
um our own
 
05:57:44.638 --> 05:57:46.570 align:start position:0%
um our own
um

05:57:46.570 --> 05:57:46.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:46.580 --> 05:57:48.230 align:start position:0%
um
contractors

05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
contractors
 
05:57:50.390 --> 05:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
um local folks take advantage of
 
05:57:52.548 --> 05:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
undocumented folks for their own
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
benefits and and pleasure whether it's
 
05:57:58.910 --> 05:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
to get lower bids on work on
 
05:58:00.948 --> 05:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
construction sites because they're
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
exploiting undocumented workers it's
 
05:58:05.810 --> 05:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
it's that what I'm talking about when a
 
05:58:09.230 --> 05:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
victim of of domestic or an assault who
 
05:58:11.448 --> 05:58:11.458 align:start position:0%
is an undocumented person will not go to
 
05:58:13.970 --> 05:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
the police because they fear that the
 
05:58:15.650 --> 05:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
transition going on we don't care about
 
05:58:17.810 --> 05:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
your crime we need to know the portrait
 
05:58:20.330 --> 05:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
because you're on the undocumented and
 
05:58:22.670 --> 05:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
we're ignore the purpose of what they
 
05:58:24.350 --> 05:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
came before the police
 
05:58:27.470 --> 05:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:30.530 --> 05:58:30.540 align:start position:0%

work in your department are you do you
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
feel that this
 
05:59:31.128 --> 05:59:31.138 align:start position:0%
um type of work is is generally done by
 
05:59:34.670 --> 05:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
the local municipalities and not really
 
05:59:36.948 --> 05:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
like outside of the scope of what you
 
05:59:39.470 --> 05:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
normally would need to deal with and so
 
05:59:41.270 --> 05:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you have a policy that says like
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hey we're going to let leave this to the
 
05:59:46.788 --> 05:59:46.798 align:start position:0%

06:00:08.350 --> 06:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's a request not a mandate
 
06:00:10.910 --> 06:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
if members of the federal government
 
06:00:12.890 --> 06:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
came to me and said I'm sure if we need
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
some help we are going to um
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
take down the local restaurant because
 
06:00:19.070 --> 06:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
we believe there's undocumented people
 
06:00:19.080 --> 06:00:20.750 align:start position:0%
we believe there's undocumented people
dishwashing

06:00:20.750 --> 06:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
dishwashing
 
06:00:22.310 --> 06:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna say
 
06:00:23.930 --> 06:00:23.940 align:start position:0%
go for it but I'm not going to help you
 
06:00:26.810 --> 06:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
with that if they tell me I'm sure if we
 
06:00:29.628 --> 06:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
have a um level 3 criminal in the state
 
06:00:32.030 --> 06:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in your county that's
 
06:00:34.368 --> 06:00:34.378 align:start position:0%
wanted for murder or assault will be the
 
06:00:35.750 --> 06:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
first one through the door to enforce
 
06:00:35.760 --> 06:00:39.530 align:start position:0%
first one through the door to enforce
that

06:00:39.530 --> 06:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:41.448 --> 06:00:41.458 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
06:00:45.110 --> 06:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman in your county
 
06:00:48.350 --> 06:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the violent crimes
 
06:00:50.030 --> 06:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
that are committed are committed by
 
06:00:56.510 --> 06:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
a number doesn't come to me so that
 
06:01:00.110 --> 06:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
means it's very low
 
06:01:05.390 --> 06:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:07.850 --> 06:01:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:01:11.690 --> 06:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
okay we are now getting into
 
06:01:13.910 --> 06:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
citizens discussing
 
06:01:15.590 --> 06:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
please I'm going to ask again three
 
06:01:18.470 --> 06:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
minutes please also keep your testimony
 
06:01:21.770 --> 06:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
to the subject matter of the bill we've
 
06:01:23.690 --> 06:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
heard about the drug trade we've heard
 
06:01:26.390 --> 06:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
about that please keep your comments
 
06:01:28.690 --> 06:01:28.700 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
06:01:32.330 --> 06:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
the sanctuary policies in New Hampshire
 
06:01:35.208 --> 06:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
thank you first person we have is
 
06:01:47.510 --> 06:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:50.990 --> 06:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
06:01:52.970 --> 06:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
committee I'm a retired medical
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
physician I've done Health projects in
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
three different Latin American countries
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
and three African countries all of which
 
06:02:03.890 --> 06:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
have serious problems that if I
 
06:02:06.590 --> 06:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
described to you you'd understand why
 
06:02:09.708 --> 06:02:09.718 align:start position:0%
oftentimes people find that they need to
 
06:02:09.718 --> 06:02:10.788 align:start position:0%
oftentimes people find that they need to
leave

06:02:10.788 --> 06:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
leave
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
and it can be very difficult to get into
 
06:02:14.570 --> 06:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
this country
 
06:02:16.548 --> 06:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
even if you've already got family here
 
06:02:19.090 --> 06:02:19.100 align:start position:0%
legally so people do come in
 
06:02:21.470 --> 06:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
undocumented I've also worked with a lot
 
06:02:24.650 --> 06:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
of immigrants in practice
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
um in this state never knew who was
 
06:02:30.110 --> 06:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
legal and who wasn't
 
06:02:33.830 --> 06:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
but the point that has been made but I
 
06:02:37.670 --> 06:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
want to re-emphasize is that creating a
 
06:02:41.750 --> 06:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
situation where people who can't figure
 
06:02:44.448 --> 06:02:44.458 align:start position:0%
out how to be here legally or know
 
06:02:47.650 --> 06:02:47.660 align:start position:0%
people who don't have a way to do that
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
means that people will be very unlikely
 
06:02:54.530 --> 06:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
to want to be involved with any law
 
06:02:56.448 --> 06:02:56.458 align:start position:0%
enforcement unless that law enforcement
 
06:02:58.368 --> 06:02:58.378 align:start position:0%
has made it clear to their Community
 
06:03:00.770 --> 06:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
where there are mixed status families
 
06:03:00.780 --> 06:03:01.970 align:start position:0%
where there are mixed status families
and

06:03:01.970 --> 06:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:04.730 --> 06:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
non-family members but people who care
 
06:03:06.590 --> 06:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
about each other
 
06:03:09.650 --> 06:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
makes it very unlikely that even though
 
06:03:11.810 --> 06:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
there's a serious crime going on that
 
06:03:14.208 --> 06:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
they will try to get help
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement which makes us all
 
06:03:19.070 --> 06:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
less safe
 
06:03:22.670 --> 06:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
so I I really urge you to say this you
 
06:03:25.070 --> 06:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
know this bill just doesn't
 
06:03:28.070 --> 06:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
pass the sniff test for being important
 
06:03:28.080 --> 06:03:29.150 align:start position:0%
pass the sniff test for being important
to

06:03:29.150 --> 06:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:03:32.208 --> 06:03:32.218 align:start position:0%
keeping safety and it may in fact make
 
06:03:34.310 --> 06:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
people less safe
 
06:03:36.890 --> 06:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
because of that fear including people
 
06:03:39.708 --> 06:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
who are here legally
 
06:03:42.048 --> 06:03:42.058 align:start position:0%
but also people who have come because
 
06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
they just have no other good
 
06:03:44.760 --> 06:03:46.070 align:start position:0%
they just have no other good
way

06:03:46.070 --> 06:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:03:48.170 --> 06:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
of getting out of very difficult
 
06:03:48.180 --> 06:03:49.850 align:start position:0%
of getting out of very difficult
situations

06:03:49.850 --> 06:03:49.860 align:start position:0%
situations
 
06:03:53.330 --> 06:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:55.730 --> 06:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:03:57.048 --> 06:03:57.058 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to once again remind
 
06:03:59.570 --> 06:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
everybody this bill is about Sanctuary
 
06:03:59.580 --> 06:04:00.770 align:start position:0%
everybody this bill is about Sanctuary
policy

06:04:00.770 --> 06:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
policy
 
06:04:02.750 --> 06:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
if you can please keep it believe that
 
06:04:04.610 --> 06:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
was what I was talking about
 
06:04:07.250 --> 06:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
further any questions
 
06:04:09.410 --> 06:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
I see none thank you very much uh next
 
06:04:21.890 --> 06:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:21.900 --> 06:04:31.970 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:04:31.970 --> 06:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:37.850 --> 06:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:41.090 --> 06:04:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Keene New Hampshire
 
06:04:45.170 --> 06:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
um Judith Reed I strongly oppose the the
 
06:04:49.250 --> 06:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
bill HB to 170 132
 
06:04:53.150 --> 06:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh and uh it's I must I want to
 
06:04:56.690 --> 06:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
speak to the bases for this bill
 
06:04:58.730 --> 06:04:58.740 align:start position:0%
um as Joe Shapiro representative Shapiro
 
06:04:58.740 --> 06:04:59.868 align:start position:0%
um as Joe Shapiro representative Shapiro
said

06:04:59.868 --> 06:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:05:02.330 --> 06:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
um the the bases are are are are
 
06:05:02.340 --> 06:05:04.430 align:start position:0%
um the the bases are are are are
fallacious

06:05:04.430 --> 06:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
fallacious
 
06:05:07.250 --> 06:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I've worked with others to assemble a
 
06:05:10.070 --> 06:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
set of facts about immigrants
 
06:05:13.368 --> 06:05:13.378 align:start position:0%
that are um stated in the uh document
 
06:05:15.650 --> 06:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
that I'm passing around so I won't I
 
06:05:17.208 --> 06:05:17.218 align:start position:0%
won't reiterate them but I will just
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
highlight a little bit of them
 
06:05:21.890 --> 06:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh there the facts that I'm I'm
 
06:05:24.410 --> 06:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
presenting to you are based on highly
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
credible sources
 
06:05:30.288 --> 06:05:30.298 align:start position:0%
um which are listed on the back
 
06:05:32.448 --> 06:05:32.458 align:start position:0%
um this bill flies in the face of those
 
06:05:32.458 --> 06:05:33.770 align:start position:0%
um this bill flies in the face of those
facts

06:05:33.770 --> 06:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
facts
 
06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's based on false fears that are
 
06:05:39.410 --> 06:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
trumped up to satisfy political ends
 
06:05:41.810 --> 06:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
hounding people who are seeking a
 
06:05:44.150 --> 06:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
livable life in our state will not make
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
us safer and it will needlessly imperil
 
06:05:49.010 --> 06:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
the well-being of hundreds of productive
 
06:05:51.170 --> 06:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
well-meaning human beings I think is
 
06:05:52.910 --> 06:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
that that point has been made very
 
06:05:55.990 --> 06:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
strongly by the law enforcement
 
06:05:58.788 --> 06:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
Representatives here
 
06:06:01.970 --> 06:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh just briefly a few facts immigrants
 
06:06:04.128 --> 06:06:04.138 align:start position:0%
accept jobs that employers can't find
 
06:06:07.850 --> 06:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
U.S citizens to do that's a fact
 
06:06:10.730 --> 06:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
it's a fact that they work hard and
 
06:06:13.850 --> 06:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
spend money fueling the economy
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
that they start businesses that create
 
06:06:20.090 --> 06:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
jobs again fueling the economy
 
06:06:22.670 --> 06:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's a fact that in the aggregate they
 
06:06:25.490 --> 06:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
pay more in taxes than they use in
 
06:06:25.500 --> 06:06:27.230 align:start position:0%
pay more in taxes than they use in
services

06:06:27.230 --> 06:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:06:30.110 --> 06:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
in short they strengthen our country and
 
06:06:31.850 --> 06:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
our state
 
06:06:34.368 --> 06:06:34.378 align:start position:0%
and finally I'd like to point out that
 
06:06:36.230 --> 06:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
unless your ancestors are from the
 
06:06:39.288 --> 06:06:39.298 align:start position:0%
Abenaki Indian Nation we in this room
 
06:06:41.810 --> 06:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
are all descended from immigrants most
 
06:06:45.110 --> 06:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
of whom came here to work and often to
 
06:06:46.430 --> 06:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
earn the funds to bring their family
 
06:06:48.708 --> 06:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
members to join them
 
06:06:51.530 --> 06:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm thankful that my ancestors were
 
06:06:53.208 --> 06:06:53.218 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
06:06:55.610 --> 06:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I certainly would never regret
 
06:07:00.170 --> 06:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
regrudge anybody else that opportunity
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:05.810 --> 06:07:05.820 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions seeing none
 
06:07:08.570 --> 06:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony next up we
 
06:07:08.580 --> 06:07:09.770 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony next up we
have

06:07:09.770 --> 06:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:07:21.730 --> 06:07:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:25.490 --> 06:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I sent you email
 
06:07:28.910 --> 06:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
um testimony mine had an elephant at the
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
top of the page trying to make the
 
06:07:35.330 --> 06:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
capital Dome go back on the top
 
06:07:40.190 --> 06:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
so we've heard a few people give the
 
06:07:43.070 --> 06:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
same reasons oh I'm against I'm not I am
 
06:07:44.810 --> 06:07:44.820 align:start position:0%

if you're going to destroy let if you're
 
06:08:10.670 --> 06:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
going to allow the cities to destroy
 
06:08:12.830 --> 06:08:12.840 align:start position:0%

The Epic Times who they have this

article on illegal image immigration
 
06:08:27.590 --> 06:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
surges at the northern U.S border
 
06:08:29.330 --> 06:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
that is 24
 
06:08:33.110 --> 06:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
000 square miles including six six New
 
06:08:35.510 --> 06:08:35.520 align:start position:0%

near the northern border
 
06:08:43.440 --> 06:08:44.628 align:start position:0%

senator and representatives that have
 
06:08:51.048 --> 06:08:51.058 align:start position:0%
put this bill forward because it has
 
06:08:53.448 --> 06:08:53.458 align:start position:0%
such Vision to protect New Hampshire
 
06:08:56.090 --> 06:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
from destroying itself
 
06:08:56.100 --> 06:08:57.410 align:start position:0%
from destroying itself
and

06:08:57.410 --> 06:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:00.890 --> 06:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
this you can't see it but you many times
 
06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen it where New
 
06:09:05.810 --> 06:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stands out in all of the blue
 
06:09:09.830 --> 06:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
around it they stand alone for
 
06:09:13.368 --> 06:09:13.378 align:start position:0%
conservative and and right and I'm very
 
06:09:15.530 --> 06:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
proud of them and I
 
06:09:17.330 --> 06:09:17.340 align:start position:0%
hope you will
 
06:09:20.930 --> 06:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh vote for this bill
 
06:09:25.250 --> 06:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:25.260 --> 06:09:26.868 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:09:26.868 --> 06:09:26.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:09:29.090 --> 06:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman thanks thank you for
 
06:09:30.590 --> 06:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
06:09:33.048 --> 06:09:33.058 align:start position:0%
um do you think that this committee and
 
06:09:36.070 --> 06:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives should pass
 
06:09:38.690 --> 06:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
legislation that tells communities what
 
06:09:41.690 --> 06:09:41.700 align:start position:0%
they cannot can and cannot do
 
06:09:45.288 --> 06:09:45.298 align:start position:0%
I believe this legislation is telling
 
06:09:48.170 --> 06:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
the cities that they cannot do like San
 
06:09:50.868 --> 06:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
Francisco did and declare themselves to
 
06:09:54.170 --> 06:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
be a place to come for illegals and that
 
06:09:57.850 --> 06:09:57.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:00.470 --> 06:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead representative thank
 
06:10:00.480 --> 06:10:01.368 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead representative thank
you

06:10:01.368 --> 06:10:01.378 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:10:01.378 --> 06:10:02.030 align:start position:0%
you
um

06:10:02.030 --> 06:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:04.190 --> 06:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
I remember our discussions previously
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I think you testified about housing
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
and not passing legislation that would
 
06:10:11.570 --> 06:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
force municipalities to make rules
 
06:10:13.250 --> 06:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
regarding housing
 
06:10:15.230 --> 06:10:15.240 align:start position:0%
so that seems contradictory to me oh no
 
06:10:18.288 --> 06:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
no when I testified before I was telling
 
06:10:21.470 --> 06:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
you guys not to have the landlords pay
 
06:10:24.770 --> 06:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
for the socialism that you were looking
 
06:10:24.780 --> 06:10:25.730 align:start position:0%
for the socialism that you were looking
for

06:10:25.730 --> 06:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:10:28.670 --> 06:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:31.910 --> 06:10:31.920 align:start position:0%

06:10:33.718 --> 06:10:34.610 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

06:10:34.610 --> 06:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:10:34.620 --> 06:10:35.930 align:start position:0%
question
um

06:10:35.930 --> 06:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
so this is saying that you can't uh have
 
06:10:40.970 --> 06:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
a policy about not
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
um enforcing Federal
 
06:10:47.448 --> 06:10:47.458 align:start position:0%
laws um regarding immigration
 
06:10:49.190 --> 06:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and you support that do you think
 
06:10:50.930 --> 06:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
that we should
 
06:10:53.090 --> 06:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
um do you all do you support the
 
06:10:57.230 --> 06:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
legislation from last uh term that said
 
06:11:00.170 --> 06:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
that that we as a state are a sanctuary
 
06:11:02.150 --> 06:11:02.160 align:start position:0%

06:11:04.610 --> 06:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
um gun policies Federal Gun policies

perform their immigration law functions

our local police are none of those

our local police are none of those

06:14:55.730 --> 06:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:14:58.250 --> 06:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
we establish and budget
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
for local law enforcement requirements
 
06:15:03.288 --> 06:15:03.298 align:start position:0%
without taking into account the needs of
 
06:15:05.390 --> 06:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
federal agencies for enforcing federal

laws
 
06:15:09.288 --> 06:15:09.298 align:start position:0%
Our Town police officers should not be
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
expected to assist federal law
 
06:15:13.850 --> 06:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement in matters for which they
 
06:15:17.208 --> 06:15:17.218 align:start position:0%
are neither prepared nor trained
 
06:15:19.250 --> 06:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
we do not want to make law enforcement
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
harder for our local police passing SB
 
06:15:25.490 --> 06:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
132 would do this victims of crimes
 
06:15:27.350 --> 06:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
witness of crimes people knowledgeable
 
06:15:30.048 --> 06:15:30.058 align:start position:0%
about illegal activities even suspects
 
06:15:33.590 --> 06:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
of low-level offenses uh if they're
 
06:15:35.868 --> 06:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
discouraged from interacting with or
 
06:15:38.330 --> 06:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
communicating with police our criminal
 
06:15:41.048 --> 06:15:41.058 align:start position:0%

even basic track traffic infections
 
06:15:47.448 --> 06:15:47.458 align:start position:0%
could turn into dangerous chases
 
06:15:49.730 --> 06:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
in addition municipalities have a right
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
to protect themselves against possible
 
06:15:53.930 --> 06:15:53.940 align:start position:0%

regarding Fourth Amendment violations
 
06:15:58.548 --> 06:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities could realistically have
 
06:16:00.590 --> 06:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
such liability even for actions that may
 
06:16:02.868 --> 06:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
have been thrust upon them by Ice agents
 
06:16:05.868 --> 06:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
our towns and our police departments and
 
06:16:07.548 --> 06:16:07.558 align:start position:0%
officers should not have to incur
 
06:16:10.430 --> 06:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
additional exposure to lawsuits over
 
06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
allegations with breach of federal
 
06:16:13.788 --> 06:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
06:16:16.368 --> 06:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
as stated in our warrant article
 
06:16:18.110 --> 06:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
Harrisville is a safe and welcoming town
 
06:16:20.090 --> 06:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
I hope you all come and visit it
 
06:16:23.628 --> 06:16:23.638 align:start position:0%
um we do have a very busy and small
 
06:16:25.690 --> 06:16:25.700 align:start position:0%
Police Department
 
06:16:30.110 --> 06:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
we view SB 132 as making our or if it
 
06:16:31.610 --> 06:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
were passed would make our town less
 
06:16:34.430 --> 06:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
safe less welcoming and also we would
 
06:16:36.430 --> 06:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
not like the idea that our Express
 
06:16:38.750 --> 06:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
self-determination regarding our
 
06:16:41.110 --> 06:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
deployment of local law enforcement
 
06:16:44.570 --> 06:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
activities would be from a top-down
 
06:16:46.970 --> 06:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
across the board basis precluded as a
 
06:16:48.350 --> 06:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
06:16:51.048 --> 06:16:51.058 align:start position:0%
um a denial of self-determination in
 
06:16:52.190 --> 06:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
this respect
 
06:16:54.770 --> 06:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
that's bad public policy so I
 
06:16:57.590 --> 06:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you vote itl
 
06:17:00.590 --> 06:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
on SB 132 and I'll take questions very
 
06:17:01.850 --> 06:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
good thank you very much representative
 
06:17:03.170 --> 06:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
Joe Kellum
 
06:17:04.970 --> 06:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
06:17:04.980 --> 06:17:06.230 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

06:17:06.230 --> 06:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:17:10.910 --> 06:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
um is is it your under is your your
 
06:17:13.910 --> 06:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation that the um the article
 
06:17:16.970 --> 06:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
that was passed um does not comply with
 
06:17:16.980 --> 06:17:18.048 align:start position:0%
that was passed um does not comply with
this

06:17:18.048 --> 06:17:18.058 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:17:22.010 --> 06:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
um law if passed because it seems like
 
06:17:24.770 --> 06:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
um The Sanctuary policy under article 7
 
06:17:28.128 --> 06:17:28.138 align:start position:0%
would require that you prohibit
 
06:17:30.890 --> 06:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
um cooperating with law enforcement uh
 
06:17:32.868 --> 06:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement Federal immigration laws in
 
06:17:35.330 --> 06:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
all circumstances and that that policy
 
06:17:38.570 --> 06:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
seems to allow for some cooperation so
 
06:17:40.368 --> 06:17:40.378 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you believe that
 
06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
it is it is compliant with this law or
 
06:17:44.690 --> 06:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:17:47.208 --> 06:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
um in effect null and void or would it
 
06:17:49.368 --> 06:17:49.378 align:start position:0%
be going to you know the courts to
 
06:17:50.868 --> 06:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
decide thank you for that question
 
06:17:54.250 --> 06:17:54.260 align:start position:0%
representative I I have read it as being
 
06:17:57.470 --> 06:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
violative of our article which would
 
06:18:00.170 --> 06:18:00.180 align:start position:0%
require its nullification I understand
 
06:18:02.150 --> 06:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
your point I wouldn't want to have to
 
06:18:04.070 --> 06:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
spend three years Liga gating at a
 
06:18:05.448 --> 06:18:05.458 align:start position:0%
federal court on behalf of the town of
 
06:18:07.430 --> 06:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
Harrisville and the expense and
 
06:18:09.350 --> 06:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
diversion of resources that would take
 
06:18:13.070 --> 06:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
but I hope you're right if you if in the
 
06:18:16.190 --> 06:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
Assumption built into your question that
 
06:18:20.150 --> 06:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
if in any way you are willing to help
 
06:18:23.208 --> 06:18:23.218 align:start position:0%
Federal authorities as our article
 
06:18:25.010 --> 06:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
expressly said we would do for example
 
06:18:27.890 --> 06:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
in the case of any breach of a New
 
06:18:30.770 --> 06:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire felony law then certainly I
 
06:18:33.770 --> 06:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that it could stand for
 
06:18:36.890 --> 06:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.410 --> 06:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:18:41.448 --> 06:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
good to see you again thank you thank
 
06:18:41.458 --> 06:18:42.470 align:start position:0%
good to see you again thank you thank
you

06:18:42.470 --> 06:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:19:04.010 --> 06:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:05.448 --> 06:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
06:19:05.458 --> 06:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
um

06:19:05.990 --> 06:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:07.850 --> 06:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
chairman turcott members of the
 
06:19:10.368 --> 06:19:10.378 align:start position:0%
committee I will try to be extremely
 
06:19:13.548 --> 06:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
brief I wanted to point out that first
 
06:19:14.930 --> 06:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
of all that
 
06:19:17.890 --> 06:19:17.900 align:start position:0%
most of the proponents testimony
 
06:19:20.930 --> 06:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
scented and relied upon Southern border
 
06:19:24.670 --> 06:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
scare tactics and much misinformation
 
06:19:27.708 --> 06:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
I should say also before again I'm a
 
06:19:30.048 --> 06:19:30.058 align:start position:0%
resident of Derry and I've been involved
 
06:19:31.910 --> 06:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire immigrants rights
 
06:19:34.510 --> 06:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
Network and worked on
 
06:19:39.670 --> 06:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
researching this SB 132
 
06:19:43.788 --> 06:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that the requirements
 
06:19:46.190 --> 06:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
give communities and law enforcement
 
06:19:49.310 --> 06:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
agencies discretion we think that it
 
06:19:52.090 --> 06:19:52.100 align:start position:0%
requires uh
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
it sets policies that would undermine
 
06:19:57.650 --> 06:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
fear and impartial policing policies
 
06:20:00.048 --> 06:20:00.058 align:start position:0%
throughout the state a policy that's
 
06:20:01.430 --> 06:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
also incorporated into the Attorney
 
06:20:04.128 --> 06:20:04.138 align:start position:0%
General's law enforcement manual
 
06:20:07.128 --> 06:20:07.138 align:start position:0%
um policies that direct
 
06:20:09.230 --> 06:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
um particular law enforcement agencies
 
06:20:12.110 --> 06:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
not to honor immigration detainers we
 
06:20:13.548 --> 06:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
think it's not discretionary and it
 
06:20:15.890 --> 06:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
would undermine many policies we also
 
06:20:19.448 --> 06:20:19.458 align:start position:0%
think it has the ability to increase
 
06:20:23.930 --> 06:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnic profiling and expose
 
06:20:26.270 --> 06:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies and communities
 
06:20:29.208 --> 06:20:29.218 align:start position:0%
to liability want to remind folks that
 
06:20:31.970 --> 06:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
the status of being in the United States
 
06:20:33.470 --> 06:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
without permission of the United States
 
06:20:35.990 --> 06:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
government is not a crime it is a
 
06:20:39.410 --> 06:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
federal civil infraction
 
06:20:42.590 --> 06:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so that to ask um law enforcement
 
06:20:45.250 --> 06:20:45.260 align:start position:0%
offices to start to enforce
 
06:20:48.410 --> 06:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
civil federal law will raise many
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
problems in our opinion we also believe
 
06:20:54.470 --> 06:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
that and I believe that the people of
 
06:20:57.770 --> 06:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do value diversity and do
 
06:21:00.310 --> 06:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
recognize the value that
 
06:21:03.530 --> 06:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
our ancestors and forebears and current
 
06:21:06.530 --> 06:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
immigrants give to the state of New
 
06:21:08.690 --> 06:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including be an important part
 
06:21:09.890 --> 06:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
of our
 
06:21:09.900 --> 06:21:10.490 align:start position:0%
of our
um

06:21:10.490 --> 06:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:12.590 --> 06:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
our Workforce
 
06:21:14.628 --> 06:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
um so we think that this legislation is
 
06:21:16.670 --> 06:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely unnecessary for New Hampshire
 
06:21:21.230 --> 06:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
for in in all ways and that the entire
 
06:21:24.890 --> 06:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
committee vote to itl this Bill thank
 
06:21:26.628 --> 06:21:26.638 align:start position:0%

testimony uh next up uh Bob Keating
Maybe

06:21:55.090 --> 06:21:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Bob Keating thank you
 
06:22:00.708 --> 06:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak here today
 
06:22:04.548 --> 06:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
uh I'm speaking uh in opposition to a
 
06:22:08.330 --> 06:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 132. I've been a long-term
 
06:22:11.390 --> 06:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
resident 48 years in uh in Nashua and a
 
06:22:13.128 --> 06:22:13.138 align:start position:0%
member of Granite State organizing
 
06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
project which works to help create safer
 
06:22:19.250 --> 06:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
and healthier communities I'm going to
 
06:22:21.470 --> 06:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
make two points and part of it is going
 
06:22:23.448 --> 06:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
to be assuring a personal story about
 
06:22:27.650 --> 06:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
how I how I think this bill goes against
 
06:22:27.660 --> 06:22:29.448 align:start position:0%
how I how I think this bill goes against
uh

06:22:29.448 --> 06:22:29.458 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:22:31.730 --> 06:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
um what hopefully is the purpose of it
 
06:22:33.850 --> 06:22:33.860 align:start position:0%
to try to make a safer Community
 
06:22:37.490 --> 06:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
First by by speaking about the sanctuary
 
06:22:43.070 --> 06:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
policy here on page two beginning on 17.
 
06:22:45.470 --> 06:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think we we've had the testimony
 
06:22:48.788 --> 06:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
already by a police chief a sheriff
 
06:22:54.288 --> 06:22:54.298 align:start position:0%
and a a town official ballot why they're
 
06:22:56.930 --> 06:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
opposed to this particular bill so I I
 
06:22:59.690 --> 06:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
want to elaborate but I think this is so
 
06:23:03.288 --> 06:23:03.298 align:start position:0%
open for multiple interpretations and
 
06:23:06.110 --> 06:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
the fear is that this will inhibit
 
06:23:11.030 --> 06:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
people who are at risk or see other
 
06:23:13.310 --> 06:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
people who are at risk to reaching out
 
06:23:16.548 --> 06:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
and uh on doing something about it
 
06:23:18.770 --> 06:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
and I want to do that by the the
 
06:23:22.430 --> 06:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
personal story I was in Boston uh
 
06:23:25.070 --> 06:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
um Monday for the marathon as I've been
 
06:23:28.190 --> 06:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
it was my 60th anniversary of uh my
 
06:23:30.170 --> 06:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
first time there as a kid when I ran it
 
06:23:32.868 --> 06:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
this time I was watching it and I was in
 
06:23:36.850 --> 06:23:36.860 align:start position:0%
Framingham and uh where my wife grew up
 
06:23:40.430 --> 06:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
and it was so striking to the day when I
 
06:23:43.190 --> 06:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
was there uh 60 years ago when there was
 
06:23:46.850 --> 06:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
200 people uh and what I was struck by
 
06:23:49.430 --> 06:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
we were standing next to the to the uh
 
06:23:52.730 --> 06:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
the railroad station and it was a sign
 
06:23:56.030 --> 06:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
electronic sign see something say
 
06:23:59.208 --> 06:23:59.218 align:start position:0%
something there was dogs going back and
 
06:24:03.288 --> 06:24:03.298 align:start position:0%
forth for smelling for for bombs ten
 
06:24:06.650 --> 06:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
years earlier I was at Mile 25 race
 
06:24:09.230 --> 06:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
walking the marathon when the marathon
 
06:24:12.170 --> 06:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
for me stopped and for many other people
 
06:24:15.110 --> 06:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
it had already stopped my wife was at
 
06:24:17.948 --> 06:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
the finish line with my granddaughter
 
06:24:22.128 --> 06:24:22.138 align:start position:0%
and right when the blondes went off a
 
06:24:25.788 --> 06:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
friend who was a volunteer there at the
 
06:24:28.670 --> 06:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
race suffered ear damage from the
 
06:24:31.190 --> 06:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
concussion from the bombs it was because
 
06:24:33.890 --> 06:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
of the kindness of strangers that many
 
06:24:36.350 --> 06:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
people's lives were saved at that point
 
06:24:37.670 --> 06:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
in time
 
06:24:40.070 --> 06:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I suspect that many of you have had
 
06:24:42.350 --> 06:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities where the kindness of
 
06:24:44.868 --> 06:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
strangers has made a difference in their
 
06:24:48.830 --> 06:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
lives I have in other places too I think
 
06:24:51.890 --> 06:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
this bill whatever the purpose and I
 
06:24:54.650 --> 06:24:54.660 align:start position:0%
believe the best intent here is really
 
06:24:59.510 --> 06:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
an anti Good Samaritan purpose all of us
 
06:25:02.330 --> 06:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
are in a situation to take risks to do
 
06:25:04.670 --> 06:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
something that would make it more
 
06:25:06.590 --> 06:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
difficult for safety for all of us
 
06:25:08.990 --> 06:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
because this is not about immigrants
 
06:25:11.868 --> 06:25:11.878 align:start position:0%
it's about all of us taking risks of
 
06:25:15.170 --> 06:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
time to protect others so I would ask
 
06:25:19.970 --> 06:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
for our strong relation to not pass this
 
06:25:23.030 --> 06:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:26.030 --> 06:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions you know
 
06:25:28.010 --> 06:25:28.020 align:start position:0%

on behalf of the police commission but
 
06:26:11.570 --> 06:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
just in case somebody finds out that I'm
 
06:26:13.368 --> 06:26:13.378 align:start position:0%
there you'll accuse me of hiding
 
06:26:13.378 --> 06:26:14.510 align:start position:0%
there you'll accuse me of hiding
something

06:26:14.510 --> 06:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
06:26:14.520 --> 06:26:16.010 align:start position:0%
something
um

06:26:16.010 --> 06:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:26:18.288 --> 06:26:18.298 align:start position:0%
I'm an immigrant rights Advocate and
 
06:26:20.448 --> 06:26:20.458 align:start position:0%
that's my job I've been doing this for
 
06:26:23.570 --> 06:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
16 years as a job and before that I've
 
06:26:25.010 --> 06:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
been doing it since I came to New
 
06:26:25.020 --> 06:26:26.150 align:start position:0%
been doing it since I came to New
Hampshire

06:26:26.150 --> 06:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:26:28.190 --> 06:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
as part of my job is to build
 
06:26:30.230 --> 06:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
relationships between police and
 
06:26:32.868 --> 06:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
communities where we come from parts of
 
06:26:35.390 --> 06:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
the world in I'm I come from Latin
 
06:26:37.070 --> 06:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
America and I can tell you for certain
 
06:26:39.830 --> 06:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
in most of Latin America if not all in
 
06:26:43.010 --> 06:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
African countries in most of Asia police
 
06:26:46.310 --> 06:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
are not honorable people police are
 
06:26:48.350 --> 06:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
crooked they're a strong arm of the
 
06:26:50.930 --> 06:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
totalitarian Communist governments they
 
06:26:52.548 --> 06:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
are the ones that rape you they're the
 
06:26:53.990 --> 06:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
ones that steal your money they are the
 
06:26:56.048 --> 06:26:56.058 align:start position:0%
ones that commit crime so we grew up
 
06:26:58.610 --> 06:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
fearing the police I remember my mom
 
06:27:00.410 --> 06:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
always tell me stay the hell away from
 
06:27:03.470 --> 06:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
the cops do not ask for help if they're
 
06:27:06.530 --> 06:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
you know so we come here and this is
 
06:27:09.170 --> 06:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
what we have in our hard drive stay away
 
06:27:11.090 --> 06:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
from the police
 
06:27:14.448 --> 06:27:14.458 align:start position:0%
so part of my job is go around talking
 
06:27:16.128 --> 06:27:16.138 align:start position:0%
to the community to the Immigrant
 
06:27:19.430 --> 06:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
Community about police work here is
 
06:27:21.048 --> 06:27:21.058 align:start position:0%
totally different our police are
 
06:27:22.970 --> 06:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
honorable trained people that will do
 
06:27:25.128 --> 06:27:25.138 align:start position:0%
the right thing and at the same time I
 
06:27:26.930 --> 06:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
go to the police departments and I build
 
06:27:28.490 --> 06:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
relationships with all kinds of little
 
06:27:30.530 --> 06:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
police departments and big and big
 
06:27:33.770 --> 06:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
police departments so we
 
06:27:35.330 --> 06:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
you know become
 
06:27:38.150 --> 06:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
respectful and knowledgeable about one
 
06:27:41.208 --> 06:27:41.218 align:start position:0%
another I am like a bridge I'm totally
 
06:27:44.570 --> 06:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
fascinated by this job and I do many
 
06:27:47.750 --> 06:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
networks just trying to build and try to
 
06:27:49.310 --> 06:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
understand we're all members of the
 
06:27:50.990 --> 06:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
community regardless of immigration
 
06:27:54.590 --> 06:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
status incidentally I carry my U.S
 
06:27:57.590 --> 06:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
passport card in my pocket I have it in
 
06:28:00.410 --> 06:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
my because in 2005 we had really bad
 
06:28:03.410 --> 06:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
instances of profiling and I know by if
 
06:28:04.788 --> 06:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
I keep my mouth shut No One's Gonna
 
06:28:07.670 --> 06:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
profile me but I don't want to go back
 
06:28:09.948 --> 06:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
to those days where I feel the police I
 
06:28:12.470 --> 06:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to go back and this bill is a
 
06:28:12.480 --> 06:28:13.310 align:start position:0%
don't want to go back and this bill is a
problem

06:28:13.310 --> 06:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:28:15.288 --> 06:28:15.298 align:start position:0%
you know it's going to be a problem for
 
06:28:16.490 --> 06:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
for people that sound like me but it's
 
06:28:20.750 --> 06:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
gonna open the doors to profiling it's
 
06:28:23.270 --> 06:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
go we're going to go back 20 years of
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
work we have little departments and big
 
06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
departments have bought adapted policies
 
06:28:30.110 --> 06:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
that work for them in their own
 
06:28:30.120 --> 06:28:31.970 align:start position:0%
that work for them in their own
municipalities

06:28:31.970 --> 06:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:28:34.850 --> 06:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
we take pride in Live Free or Die
 
06:28:37.490 --> 06:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
we do not need to be micromanage each
 
06:28:39.410 --> 06:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
department has adopted policies that
 
06:28:41.628 --> 06:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
works for their own for their own
 
06:28:41.638 --> 06:28:42.890 align:start position:0%
works for their own for their own
localities

06:28:42.890 --> 06:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
localities
 
06:28:45.650 --> 06:28:45.660 align:start position:0%
so we need to just keep things the way
 
06:28:48.470 --> 06:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
they are the Russians are not coming I
 
06:28:50.270 --> 06:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
hear people reminding like of the movie
 
06:28:52.490 --> 06:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
and it's almost comical but it's really
 
06:28:55.010 --> 06:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
sad that today we still have to inflame
 
06:28:58.190 --> 06:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
fear of people that are here just trying
 
06:29:01.910 --> 06:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
to do the right thing so please if you
 
06:29:04.730 --> 06:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
have any sense in your life just vote
 
06:29:06.128 --> 06:29:06.138 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:29:09.530 --> 06:29:09.540 align:start position:0%

06:29:11.208 --> 06:29:11.218 align:start position:0%
not have in New Hampshire

which is several years ago I was in a
 
06:29:58.548 --> 06:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
parking lot and I was I got a little
 
06:30:02.288 --> 06:30:02.298 align:start position:0%
distracted I backed out and I hit a car
 
06:30:05.510 --> 06:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
my fault entirely
 
06:30:08.750 --> 06:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
I jumped out of the car the other person
 
06:30:11.570 --> 06:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
had a car full of
 
06:30:11.580 --> 06:30:12.548 align:start position:0%
had a car full of
um

06:30:12.548 --> 06:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:16.670 --> 06:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
passengers and I went over to say oh my
 
06:30:18.350 --> 06:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
gosh I'm so sorry is everyone all right
 
06:30:21.770 --> 06:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
everyone was fine I offered to exchange
 
06:30:24.890 --> 06:30:24.900 align:start position:0%
information possibly call the police so
 
06:30:27.470 --> 06:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
we could so my insurance could pay so I
 
06:30:30.230 --> 06:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
could take care of the damages
 
06:30:32.690 --> 06:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
and the women
 
06:30:35.810 --> 06:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
um who appeared to speak no English said
 
06:30:37.788 --> 06:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no no no no no no no no
 
06:30:40.010 --> 06:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
no it's okay
 
06:30:42.110 --> 06:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:30:46.368 --> 06:30:46.378 align:start position:0%
the look of Terror in her eyes will it
 
06:30:48.410 --> 06:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
haunts me still
 
06:30:50.628 --> 06:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
she was so afraid that I was going to
 
06:30:52.128 --> 06:30:52.138 align:start position:0%
call the police
 
06:30:55.190 --> 06:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
and it became clear to me that the
 
06:30:57.470 --> 06:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
reason why she most likely was afraid
 
06:30:59.810 --> 06:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
that the police would be called
 
06:31:03.110 --> 06:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
because most likely either she or
 
06:31:06.350 --> 06:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
someone in her car was undocumented
 
06:31:06.360 --> 06:31:07.610 align:start position:0%
someone in her car was undocumented
person

06:31:07.610 --> 06:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
person
 
06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
and so because of that she ended up with
 
06:31:13.250 --> 06:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
a fairly significant amount of damage to
 
06:31:16.850 --> 06:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
her car that ended up not getting
 
06:31:20.750 --> 06:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
covered by me as it should have been
 
06:31:24.470 --> 06:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
and when I think of the fear in her eyes
 
06:31:28.610 --> 06:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
I can only imagine how much greater that
 
06:31:30.230 --> 06:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
fear would have been
 
06:31:33.770 --> 06:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
if the circumstances had even been more
 
06:31:36.110 --> 06:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
um you know if it if this was someone in
 
06:31:38.448 --> 06:31:38.458 align:start position:0%
a violent situation someone who had been
 
06:31:41.510 --> 06:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
the victim of a violent crime and yet
 
06:31:44.628 --> 06:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
still felt that either to protect
 
06:31:47.510 --> 06:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
themselves or those around them that
 
06:31:50.510 --> 06:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
they could not tap into the help and
 
06:31:54.288 --> 06:31:54.298 align:start position:0%
resources that are there that should be
 
06:31:56.570 --> 06:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
available to all of us without the fear
 
06:31:58.910 --> 06:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
that that would lead to somebody
 
06:32:02.090 --> 06:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
potentially being deported perhaps the
 
06:32:04.368 --> 06:32:04.378 align:start position:0%
only Breadwinner in their family perhaps
 
06:32:06.948 --> 06:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
a parent who would lose access to their
 
06:32:08.930 --> 06:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
kids so the fear to me was
 
06:32:08.940 --> 06:32:10.910 align:start position:0%
kids so the fear to me was
understandable

06:32:10.910 --> 06:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
06:32:12.890 --> 06:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
but heartbreaking
 
06:32:16.128 --> 06:32:16.138 align:start position:0%
so that's my story and that's why I
 
06:32:20.330 --> 06:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
would urge you to vote itl on this bill
 
06:32:22.850 --> 06:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
we've heard today that it's unnecessary
 
06:32:25.730 --> 06:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
the police in fact it interferes with
 
06:32:25.740 --> 06:32:26.810 align:start position:0%
the police in fact it interferes with
police

06:32:26.810 --> 06:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
police
 
06:32:30.230 --> 06:32:30.240 align:start position:0%

frequently does what Ms Castillo
 
06:33:31.368 --> 06:33:31.378 align:start position:0%
referred to we frequently help to build
 
06:33:33.190 --> 06:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
relationships between traditionally
 
06:33:35.448 --> 06:33:35.458 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised communities and the
 
06:33:37.490 --> 06:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
government and public officials we've
 
06:33:39.410 --> 06:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
brought together residents of public
 
06:33:41.390 --> 06:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
housing and the police members of The
 
06:33:43.430 --> 06:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
Immigrant community and the police and
 
06:33:44.708 --> 06:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
so on
 
06:33:49.128 --> 06:33:49.138 align:start position:0%
SB 132 and and we were very involved in
 
06:33:51.410 --> 06:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
helping the Manchester police craft the
 
06:33:53.208 --> 06:33:53.218 align:start position:0%
policy that Chief aldenberg referred to
 
06:33:55.610 --> 06:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
today it was actually came out of a
 
06:33:57.110 --> 06:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
discussion in the basement of a Catholic
 
06:33:58.610 --> 06:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
Church in Manchester
 
06:34:01.010 --> 06:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
and the stories that we heard at that
 
06:34:03.890 --> 06:34:03.900 align:start position:0%
meeting were from immigrants both with
 
06:34:06.110 --> 06:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
documents and without who told story
 
06:34:08.390 --> 06:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
after Story of being stopped by the
 
06:34:10.850 --> 06:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
police for walking down the street for
 
06:34:13.788 --> 06:34:13.798 align:start position:0%
carrying a television for driving and
 
06:34:15.288 --> 06:34:15.298 align:start position:0%
being asked in these completely
 
06:34:17.330 --> 06:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
irrelevant situations whether or not
 
06:34:20.150 --> 06:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
they were a documented immigrant as a
 
06:34:22.128 --> 06:34:22.138 align:start position:0%
result of that the Manchester police
 
06:34:25.190 --> 06:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
made a policy that they would not ask a
 
06:34:28.010 --> 06:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
person's documentation status if the
 
06:34:30.650 --> 06:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
interaction was not an interaction that
 
06:34:33.170 --> 06:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
would lead to criminal charges that has
 
06:34:35.090 --> 06:34:35.100 align:start position:0%
made all the difference in the world in
 
06:34:38.270 --> 06:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
our community and it is a policy whether
 
06:34:40.250 --> 06:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
or not it's a sanctuary policy might be
 
06:34:42.288 --> 06:34:42.298 align:start position:0%
something that we could debate but my
 
06:34:45.530 --> 06:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
fear about Senate Bill 132 is that
 
06:34:47.570 --> 06:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
someone would decide this policy was a
 
06:34:49.730 --> 06:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy and the city would end
 
06:34:51.770 --> 06:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
up in court and our immigrant neighbors
 
06:34:53.170 --> 06:34:53.180 align:start position:0%
would suffer
 
06:34:55.910 --> 06:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
sb-132 is a discriminatory and harmful
 
06:34:57.170 --> 06:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
bill that would force New Hampshire
 
06:34:59.150 --> 06:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
police departments to act as immigration
 
06:35:01.730 --> 06:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
police it would destroy all the work
 
06:35:04.128 --> 06:35:04.138 align:start position:0%
that many many many non-profit and
 
06:35:05.750 --> 06:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
ethnic organizations around the state
 
06:35:07.670 --> 06:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
have done to build positive
 
06:35:09.530 --> 06:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
relationships between the police in our
 
06:35:09.540 --> 06:35:10.990 align:start position:0%
relationships between the police in our
communities

06:35:10.990 --> 06:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:35:13.128 --> 06:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
sb132 will not make our communities
 
06:35:15.770 --> 06:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
safer but instead will make us all less
 
06:35:18.110 --> 06:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
safe as people who may have friends or
 
06:35:20.690 --> 06:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
family members or fellow congregants who
 
06:35:22.490 --> 06:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
may not have legal documents at this
 
06:35:24.770 --> 06:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
moment they may actually be eligible for
 
06:35:26.690 --> 06:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
legal documents tomorrow but they may
 
06:35:28.610 --> 06:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
not have them at this moment all of
 
06:35:30.288 --> 06:35:30.298 align:start position:0%
those people will be afraid to call the
 
06:35:32.628 --> 06:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
police to report crimes domestic
 
06:35:35.510 --> 06:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
violence or other concerns this is not
 
06:35:38.628 --> 06:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
just a bad idea this is a false solution
 
06:35:41.390 --> 06:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
to a non-existent problem and I urge you
 
06:35:46.430 --> 06:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
to vote sb-132 in expedient to legislate
 
06:35:47.690 --> 06:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony

um a recap of testimony in the Senate
 
06:36:03.470 --> 06:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
and a Kevin Williams testified that
 
06:36:07.930 --> 06:36:07.940 align:start position:0%
uh there are special visas for
 
06:36:10.910 --> 06:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
undocumented aliens who cooperate with
 
06:36:12.288 --> 06:36:12.298 align:start position:0%
the police
 
06:36:14.390 --> 06:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
and that they're good for two years
 
06:36:16.548 --> 06:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
during which time they can apply to
 
06:36:18.708 --> 06:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
become a permanent resident do you know

06:37:18.410 --> 06:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
committee to Market in expedient to
 
06:37:18.420 --> 06:37:19.548 align:start position:0%
committee to Market in expedient to
legislate

06:37:19.548 --> 06:37:19.558 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
06:37:22.368 --> 06:37:22.378 align:start position:0%
as our lawmakers I understand that it is
 
06:37:25.368 --> 06:37:25.378 align:start position:0%
no easy task to balance both the intent
 
06:37:27.110 --> 06:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
and the impact of the many bills that
 
06:37:29.330 --> 06:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
come before you and I urge you to see
 
06:37:31.310 --> 06:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
this bill as an attempt to solve a
 
06:37:32.930 --> 06:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
problem that doesn't exist by pushing
 
06:37:34.310 --> 06:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
the idea that New Hampshire has
 
06:37:36.770 --> 06:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary cities it does not but it does
 
06:37:38.810 --> 06:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
have welcoming policies in order to
 
06:37:40.670 --> 06:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
ensure that the cities and towns that
 
06:37:42.650 --> 06:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
make up our great state are places that
 
06:37:45.770 --> 06:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
people want to come to to stay in and
 
06:37:48.410 --> 06:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:50.750 --> 06:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important to note as
 
06:37:52.610 --> 06:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
well as what other people have said is
 
06:37:54.650 --> 06:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
that this bill would void the hard work
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
that many municipalities including my
 
06:37:59.208 --> 06:37:59.218 align:start position:0%
own municipality my own town hometown of
 
06:38:01.310 --> 06:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester has taken to implement
 
06:38:03.650 --> 06:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
policies ordinances
 
06:38:05.690 --> 06:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
um and regulations that ensure that
 
06:38:07.850 --> 06:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
every person in the community regardless
 
06:38:09.470 --> 06:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
of their status regardless of where
 
06:38:11.990 --> 06:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're from feel safe and has trust in
 
06:38:13.730 --> 06:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement departments that
 
06:38:16.128 --> 06:38:16.138 align:start position:0%
work to ensure that our communities are
 
06:38:18.830 --> 06:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
safe and secure for everyone I myself am
 
06:38:20.570 --> 06:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
an immigrant coming from the Democratic
 
06:38:22.788 --> 06:38:22.798 align:start position:0%
Republic of Congo who grew up in
 
06:38:24.410 --> 06:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester and has made the granite
 
06:38:27.048 --> 06:38:27.058 align:start position:0%
state my home for over 30 years the
 
06:38:28.730 --> 06:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
majority of the time has been as an
 
06:38:31.788 --> 06:38:31.798 align:start position:0%
undocumented person and now as a U.S
 
06:38:34.490 --> 06:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
citizen still a person
 
06:38:37.670 --> 06:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
decisions from municipalities do take
 
06:38:40.128 --> 06:38:40.138 align:start position:0%
the form of policies procedures and
 
06:38:42.230 --> 06:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
rules and they are informed by input
 
06:38:44.448 --> 06:38:44.458 align:start position:0%
from those communities I have the
 
06:38:46.490 --> 06:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
immense privilege of being able to work
 
06:38:48.948 --> 06:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
in multiple spaces across the state
 
06:38:51.230 --> 06:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
spaces that include lawmakers such as
 
06:38:53.510 --> 06:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
yourself Community leaders law
 
06:38:55.190 --> 06:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement and everyday community
 
06:38:57.708 --> 06:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
members I have sat on the Manchester
 
06:38:59.448 --> 06:38:59.458 align:start position:0%
Police Department's comp stack Community
 
06:39:02.270 --> 06:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
Advisory Group to support their work to
 
06:39:04.250 --> 06:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
decrease gun crimes and incidences
 
06:39:07.128 --> 06:39:07.138 align:start position:0%
involving young people in Manchester
 
06:39:09.830 --> 06:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
our conversations were dominated by the
 
06:39:11.628 --> 06:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
importance of building trust and Rapport
 
06:39:14.090 --> 06:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
within the community in order to ensure
 
06:39:16.250 --> 06:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
that this growing problem does not
 
06:39:18.470 --> 06:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
continue and this bill would undermine
 
06:39:19.670 --> 06:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
that work
 
06:39:21.650 --> 06:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
today I was humbled to be in a space
 
06:39:24.170 --> 06:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
with over 30 young people of color most
 
06:39:25.788 --> 06:39:25.798 align:start position:0%
of them all of them actually high school
 
06:39:28.010 --> 06:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
students from Manchester as well as
 
06:39:30.350 --> 06:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
other local schools and they told me
 
06:39:32.690 --> 06:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
their hopes their dreams as well as
 
06:39:35.330 --> 06:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching stories gut-wrenching
 
06:39:37.670 --> 06:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
stories of issues and difficulties that
 
06:39:39.288 --> 06:39:39.298 align:start position:0%
they experience at home and in their
 
06:39:42.288 --> 06:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
personal lives issues of assault of rape
 
06:39:44.990 --> 06:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence and ongoing abuse
 
06:39:46.970 --> 06:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
things that they have to deal with every
 
06:39:48.470 --> 06:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
single day
 
06:39:51.288 --> 06:39:51.298 align:start position:0%
and these difficulties reflect the broad
 
06:39:54.110 --> 06:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
range of problems and issues that too
 
06:39:56.208 --> 06:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
many grandestators are experiencing
 
06:39:59.810 --> 06:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
every day this bill would seek to
 
06:40:02.690 --> 06:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
undermine those people's abilities might
 
06:40:04.430 --> 06:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
our students our community members
 
06:40:06.350 --> 06:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
ability to be able to go to law
 
06:40:08.948 --> 06:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement and seek help and protection
 
06:40:12.590 --> 06:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
we do not have Sanctuary cities in New
 
06:40:15.650 --> 06:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have policies that have
 
06:40:18.410 --> 06:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
been created over many many years to
 
06:40:20.448 --> 06:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
ensure that our communities are actually
 
06:40:23.150 --> 06:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
places where people feel safe and secure
 
06:40:25.490 --> 06:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
I have been part of those ongoing
 
06:40:28.730 --> 06:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
efforts and I implore you all to also be
 
06:40:31.610 --> 06:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
part of those efforts and vote itl on
 
06:40:33.230 --> 06:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you I'm happy to take
 
06:40:33.240 --> 06:40:35.270 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you I'm happy to take
questions

06:40:35.270 --> 06:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:40:38.570 --> 06:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edward
 
06:40:40.910 --> 06:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good afternoon
 
06:40:43.430 --> 06:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today I'll ask
 
06:40:45.470 --> 06:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
you the same question about Mr Williams
 
06:40:47.930 --> 06:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
testimony do you know it to be true
 
06:40:51.470 --> 06:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not a special visas that are
 
06:40:54.230 --> 06:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
good for two years
 
06:40:56.470 --> 06:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
um are issued to
 
06:40:59.208 --> 06:40:59.218 align:start position:0%
undocumented persons who cooperate with
 
06:41:01.010 --> 06:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
the police and that they can then apply
 
06:41:04.010 --> 06:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
to become a permanent resident so as
 
06:41:05.448 --> 06:41:05.458 align:start position:0%
someone who has gone through the
 
06:41:08.150 --> 06:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
immigration system and has been with
 
06:41:09.530 --> 06:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
others we've also gone through the
 
06:41:11.448 --> 06:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
immigration system whether a category
 
06:41:13.310 --> 06:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
like that exists again I'm not I'm
 
06:41:15.948 --> 06:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
myself I'm not an immigration lawyer but
 
06:41:18.948 --> 06:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
those categories of whether a relief and
 
06:41:20.628 --> 06:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
um categories where people can apply to
 
06:41:23.448 --> 06:41:23.458 align:start position:0%
are very complex and the criteria to
 
06:41:25.368 --> 06:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
whether or not you are would be eligible
 
06:41:27.650 --> 06:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
for those specific categories really
 
06:41:30.830 --> 06:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
depends on a many many factors which are
 
06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
you have to look at on a case-by-case
 
06:41:35.090 --> 06:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
basis though do those visas exist
 
06:41:38.330 --> 06:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
possibly but do they apply to people all
 
06:41:40.970 --> 06:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
the people who go and come and cooperate
 
06:41:42.890 --> 06:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
with police no they don't because not
 
06:41:44.628 --> 06:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
every single category that we have
 
06:41:46.788 --> 06:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
within our immigration system as limited
 
06:41:49.310 --> 06:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
as they are apply to everyone who would
 
06:41:50.750 --> 06:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
possibly benefit them thank you very
 
06:41:53.810 --> 06:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome representative
 
06:41:55.670 --> 06:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
06:41:57.830 --> 06:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm seeking to get some
 
06:42:00.890 --> 06:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
clarification about your statement that
 
06:42:05.990 --> 06:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have any Sanctuary cities in
 
06:42:08.510 --> 06:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or or towns or whatever
 
06:42:11.690 --> 06:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
and no Sanctuary policies as defined in
 
06:42:14.868 --> 06:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
this in this um
 
06:42:17.390 --> 06:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
but then you also made the statement
 
06:42:19.610 --> 06:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
that it would that this legislation
 
06:42:23.150 --> 06:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
would nullify some of the work that had
 
06:42:26.030 --> 06:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
been done and so since this legislation
 
06:42:29.150 --> 06:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
only nullifies Sanctuary policies I
 
06:42:31.490 --> 06:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
don't understand how
 
06:42:34.788 --> 06:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
um based on your interpretation how it
 
06:42:37.250 --> 06:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
would nullify the the work that has been
 
06:42:39.890 --> 06:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
done since there have been no Sanctuary
 
06:42:41.868 --> 06:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
policies so I said there are no
 
06:42:43.430 --> 06:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary cities
 
06:42:44.690 --> 06:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
um so there's not a city in New
 
06:42:46.490 --> 06:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has said that we will
 
06:42:48.650 --> 06:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
completely flout immigration policy in
 
06:42:50.868 --> 06:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
any undocumented person all over the
 
06:42:52.610 --> 06:42:52.620 align:start position:0%
country can come and live here there's
 
06:42:54.048 --> 06:42:54.058 align:start position:0%
not a city that has done that I mean
 
06:42:56.330 --> 06:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
municipality has done that however what
 
06:42:58.610 --> 06:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
we do have is that we have policy we
 
06:43:00.650 --> 06:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
have policies we have rules we have
 
06:43:02.810 --> 06:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
regulations statutes some other folks
 
06:43:04.250 --> 06:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
have shown come up here and given those
 
06:43:07.910 --> 06:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
examples and under the the text of this
 
06:43:11.628 --> 06:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
bill it up says that policies include a
 
06:43:15.350 --> 06:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
broad range of procedures statutes all
 
06:43:17.030 --> 06:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
sorts of things that towns have put into
 
06:43:18.650 --> 06:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
place in order to ensure that their
 
06:43:20.270 --> 06:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
cities and their municipalities are
 
06:43:20.280 --> 06:43:21.650 align:start position:0%
cities and their municipalities are
welcoming

06:43:21.650 --> 06:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
welcoming
 
06:43:25.430 --> 06:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:27.470 --> 06:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill you look like you
 
06:43:30.350 --> 06:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
had a question no I did thank you for
 
06:43:33.170 --> 06:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question so has there been any
 
06:43:35.030 --> 06:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
cities that tried to become Sanctuary
 
06:43:36.770 --> 06:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
cities in New Hampshire so I don't live
 
06:43:38.510 --> 06:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
in every city in New Hampshire so I have
 
06:43:46.430 --> 06:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:49.190 --> 06:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:43:50.868 --> 06:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you for your
 
06:43:53.628 --> 06:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so much next uh

06:44:11.270 --> 06:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
honorable members of this committee for
 
06:44:13.610 --> 06:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Devin chafee and I
 
06:44:15.410 --> 06:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
am the executive director of the
 
06:44:17.390 --> 06:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union of New
 
06:44:19.310 --> 06:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I appreciate the
 
06:44:22.010 --> 06:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be before you today to
 
06:44:26.330 --> 06:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to SB 132 and I
 
06:44:29.208 --> 06:44:29.218 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that for in my point of
 
06:44:31.490 --> 06:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
view that this bill clearly implicates
 
06:44:34.548 --> 06:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
two core issues one is should New
 
06:44:36.890 --> 06:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers be forced to pay to
 
06:44:39.110 --> 06:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
do the job of the federal government and
 
06:44:41.570 --> 06:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
civil immigration enforcement and two
 
06:44:44.330 --> 06:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
will the legislature endanger New
 
06:44:45.948 --> 06:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitutional protections
 
06:44:48.650 --> 06:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
against unwarranted detention and I just
 
06:44:51.230 --> 06:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
want to dive straight into what has been
 
06:44:52.610 --> 06:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
I think dominated a lot of the
 
06:44:55.250 --> 06:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
conversation at this hearing about what
 
06:44:57.490 --> 06:44:57.500 align:start position:0%
this bill does and doesn't prohibit
 
06:44:59.990 --> 06:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
because I think you've heard a number of
 
06:45:01.368 --> 06:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
Representatives certainly in the
 
06:45:04.090 --> 06:45:04.100 align:start position:0%
beginning representing that this bill
 
06:45:06.890 --> 06:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
is voluntary that it doesn't actually
 
06:45:10.190 --> 06:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
require police departments to cooperate
 
06:45:12.110 --> 06:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I want to say that in my reading of
 
06:45:14.750 --> 06:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
the bill this is simply not the case and
 
06:45:16.788 --> 06:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
I understand why it's difficult to to to
 
06:45:18.590 --> 06:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
figure it out and I really appreciate
 
06:45:20.510 --> 06:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative yokella trying to knit
 
06:45:22.910 --> 06:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
together the different definitions in
 
06:45:24.948 --> 06:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
this bill but to unders because to
 
06:45:26.868 --> 06:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
understand how expansive it is you
 
06:45:28.430 --> 06:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
really need to look at not only the
 
06:45:30.470 --> 06:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
prohibition you need to look at the
 
06:45:33.230 --> 06:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
definition of a sanctuary policy and you
 
06:45:35.030 --> 06:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
need to look at a definition of policy
 
06:45:36.708 --> 06:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
and how they all relate under this bill
 
06:45:39.650 --> 06:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
I mean in some ways it's intuitive if
 
06:45:42.048 --> 06:45:42.058 align:start position:0%
you are going to prohibit cities and
 
06:45:44.690 --> 06:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
police departments from not cooperating
 
06:45:47.090 --> 06:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
with Federal immigration enforcement
 
06:45:50.390 --> 06:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
then you are requiring them to cooperate
 
06:45:52.548 --> 06:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
that's that's not a very complicated
 
06:45:55.250 --> 06:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
notion but this is affirmed by what is
 
06:45:58.190 --> 06:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
an extremely expansive definition here
 
06:46:01.548 --> 06:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
if you knit the language together again
 
06:46:04.128 --> 06:46:04.138 align:start position:0%
this bill says that law enforcement
 
06:46:06.948 --> 06:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
cannot knowingly enact issue adopt
 
06:46:08.990 --> 06:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
promulgate and Forest permit endorse
 
06:46:11.930 --> 06:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
maintain or have in in effect any rule
 
06:46:13.788 --> 06:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
directed policy procedure regulation
 
06:46:16.070 --> 06:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
motion order ordinance resolution
 
06:46:20.090 --> 06:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment practice or custom written or
 
06:46:22.190 --> 06:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
Unwritten and so this is a very
 
06:46:24.530 --> 06:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
expansive definition of what is
 
06:46:25.968 --> 06:46:25.978 align:start position:0%
prohibited and what is considered a
 
06:46:28.788 --> 06:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote sanctuary policy so
 
06:46:31.190 --> 06:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
essentially effectively under this bill
 
06:46:33.830 --> 06:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
a lieutenant or a chief can't even have
 
06:46:36.110 --> 06:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
a side conversation with their Police
 
06:46:37.968 --> 06:46:37.978 align:start position:0%
Department about the fact that they
 
06:46:39.968 --> 06:46:39.978 align:start position:0%
might not want to be prioritizing
 
06:46:42.948 --> 06:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
cooperation with immigration because of
 
06:46:45.948 --> 06:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
other resources under the language in
 
06:46:46.910 --> 06:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:46:48.590 --> 06:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
because if they did they would
 
06:46:51.230 --> 06:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
potentially be engaging in creating a
 
06:46:53.750 --> 06:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote prohibited policy that
 
06:46:55.430 --> 06:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be in place under this legislation
 
06:46:57.410 --> 06:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
and they would be at risk for violating
 
06:46:59.930 --> 06:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
the law I do also want to point out that
 
06:47:02.390 --> 06:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere in the definition of
 
06:47:04.670 --> 06:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy
 
06:47:07.310 --> 06:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill it does not state that the
 
06:47:10.610 --> 06:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
prohibition has to be total or in all
 
06:47:12.830 --> 06:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances there's nothing in there
 
06:47:13.968 --> 06:47:13.978 align:start position:0%
that says you have to prohibit
 
06:47:16.490 --> 06:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
cooperation in all circumstances all
 
06:47:18.530 --> 06:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
police departments in the state of New
 
06:47:20.930 --> 06:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cooperate with immigration
 
06:47:23.868 --> 06:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement in some circumstances but
 
06:47:27.110 --> 06:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
this bill simply says any even Unwritten
 
06:47:29.930 --> 06:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
practice or statement oral or written
 
06:47:32.330 --> 06:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
that says that we will not be
 
06:47:34.968 --> 06:47:34.978 align:start position:0%
cooperating with immigration enforcement
 
06:47:37.310 --> 06:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
is is prohibited so it's a very very
 
06:47:40.010 --> 06:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
broad prohibition and this is why law
 
06:47:42.110 --> 06:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement such as the chief from
 
06:47:44.750 --> 06:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester are so strongly against this
 
06:47:46.490 --> 06:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
policy for those of you familiar with
 
06:47:48.590 --> 06:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
the ACLU of New Hampshire you will know
 
06:47:50.690 --> 06:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
that it is not that common that the ACLU
 
06:47:52.368 --> 06:47:52.378 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and law enforcement
 
06:47:55.310 --> 06:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
come together in in full agreement on
 
06:47:57.890 --> 06:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
any given Bill and today I'm here to
 
06:48:00.170 --> 06:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
hand out a letter from the police Chiefs
 
06:48:03.530 --> 06:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
of Hudson Manchester Nashua Merrick
 
06:48:05.930 --> 06:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
Hollis and Dover in addition to the
 
06:48:08.270 --> 06:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
sheriffs from Stratford County and
 
06:48:09.770 --> 06:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
Cheshire County
 
06:48:13.548 --> 06:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
asking you to itl SB 132 because all of
 
06:48:15.350 --> 06:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
them believe that this bill is going to
 
06:48:17.270 --> 06:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on the safety of
 
06:48:19.128 --> 06:48:19.138 align:start position:0%
their communities and they believe that
 
06:48:21.170 --> 06:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
it effectively robs the ability of local
 
06:48:23.330 --> 06:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
communities to decide how to best use
 
06:48:25.788 --> 06:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
their resources
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pass up okay and you are
 
06:48:31.730 --> 06:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
Feeney that's four four and a half
 
06:48:34.490 --> 06:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
minutes so I'm gonna stop you there I
 
06:48:36.110 --> 06:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
will say thank you very much for
 
06:48:38.570 --> 06:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
actually speaking to the subject matter
 
06:48:40.968 --> 06:48:40.978 align:start position:0%
of the bill that was very good uh
 
06:48:43.310 --> 06:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
06:48:45.948 --> 06:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just gotta I'm
 
06:48:47.628 --> 06:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
over here man oh thank you that's okay
 
06:48:49.490 --> 06:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to join a question for
 
06:48:51.770 --> 06:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
you as executive director
 
06:48:53.510 --> 06:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um how many cases a year does your
 
06:48:54.770 --> 06:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
office deal where you represent
 
06:48:57.948 --> 06:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
undocumented uh individuals in the state
 
06:48:59.690 --> 06:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire they may be charged or
 
06:48:59.700 --> 06:49:00.590 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire they may be charged or
whatever

06:49:00.590 --> 06:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:49:03.288 --> 06:49:03.298 align:start position:0%
I would say that we I mean how many so
 
06:49:05.030 --> 06:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
you're asking how many cases regarding
 
06:49:07.250 --> 06:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
how many immigration related cases do we
 
06:49:10.310 --> 06:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
take for undocumented individuals I I
 
06:49:11.990 --> 06:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
would have to go back and check with my
 
06:49:15.170 --> 06:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
office it's probably under 10. something
 
06:49:17.270 --> 06:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
around that okay thank you
 
06:49:20.270 --> 06:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative Edward
 
06:49:22.670 --> 06:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
um can you confirm that
 
06:49:25.990 --> 06:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
neither the police
 
06:49:28.850 --> 06:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
the Chief of Police Association and the
 
06:49:31.368 --> 06:49:31.378 align:start position:0%
sheriff's Association spoke uh in
 
06:49:33.830 --> 06:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
opposition or support I haven't asked
 
06:49:35.750 --> 06:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
the chiefs of Police Association what
 
06:49:37.070 --> 06:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
their whether or not they're taking a
 
06:49:38.930 --> 06:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I do know that
 
06:49:41.990 --> 06:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
several independent police Chiefs are
 
06:49:43.430 --> 06:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about the impact that this
 
06:49:44.868 --> 06:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
bill will have on the safety of their
 
06:49:49.070 --> 06:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:51.948 --> 06:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
06:49:51.958 --> 06:49:53.208 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

06:49:53.208 --> 06:49:53.218 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:49:55.310 --> 06:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
um it seems like your your
 
06:49:57.288 --> 06:49:57.298 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law is a little
 
06:49:59.690 --> 06:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
bit different than mine but
 
06:50:06.468 --> 06:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:10.128 --> 06:50:10.138 align:start position:0%
um talk a little bit about what your
 
06:50:14.750 --> 06:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation is of cooperating because
 
06:50:16.910 --> 06:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
um it is not really defined in here and
 
06:50:19.548 --> 06:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
so the level of cooperation that is
 
06:50:21.830 --> 06:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
required by this law seems to be
 
06:50:24.708 --> 06:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
nebulous you could Define that
 
06:50:27.468 --> 06:50:27.478 align:start position:0%
um you know if you cooperated in a case
 
06:50:30.288 --> 06:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
every five years that may be cooperating
 
06:50:34.190 --> 06:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement agencies or maybe
 
06:50:36.410 --> 06:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
you have to cooperate on every case let
 
06:50:38.868 --> 06:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
me can you speak to your interpretation
 
06:50:44.208 --> 06:50:44.218 align:start position:0%
of that requirement for cooperation
 
06:50:46.368 --> 06:50:46.378 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's a very
 
06:50:48.288 --> 06:50:48.298 align:start position:0%
good question and I think part of the
 
06:50:50.390 --> 06:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
concern here is that I think what we're
 
06:50:52.730 --> 06:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
seeing is that law enforcement entities
 
06:50:56.628 --> 06:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
are are are not clear on what it means
 
06:50:58.310 --> 06:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
to cooperate and I think there is
 
06:51:01.490 --> 06:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
significant concern that any
 
06:51:01.500 --> 06:51:02.390 align:start position:0%
significant concern that any
um

06:51:02.390 --> 06:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:04.788 --> 06:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
any policy that might limit cooperation
 
06:51:07.548 --> 06:51:07.558 align:start position:0%
with Federal immigration enforcement in
 
06:51:10.670 --> 06:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
any way including like denying any
 
06:51:13.250 --> 06:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
voluntary requests made by immigration
 
06:51:15.468 --> 06:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement would be prohibited under
 
06:51:17.330 --> 06:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
this statute I think that's the concern
 
06:51:18.890 --> 06:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
here and I think that concern is very
 
06:51:18.900 --> 06:51:20.750 align:start position:0%
here and I think that concern is very
reasonable

06:51:20.750 --> 06:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
06:51:24.968 --> 06:51:24.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:27.048 --> 06:51:27.058 align:start position:0%
representative L word do you have a
 
06:51:28.730 --> 06:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
question again
 
06:51:31.910 --> 06:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes okay go ahead Mr chairman I do
 
06:51:33.590 --> 06:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at
 
06:51:33.600 --> 06:51:34.670 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at
um

06:51:34.670 --> 06:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:34.680 --> 06:51:36.590 align:start position:0%
um

Roman
 
06:51:40.250 --> 06:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
seven Sanctuary policy definition and
 
06:51:42.948 --> 06:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about
 
06:51:45.590 --> 06:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
oh the last part of the last sentence
 
06:51:51.830 --> 06:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:54.230 --> 06:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
there can't be any policy prohibiting
 
06:51:56.270 --> 06:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
cooperating within enforcement of
 
06:51:58.430 --> 06:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
federal immigration laws with the
 
06:52:00.770 --> 06:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the federal immigration
 
06:52:00.780 --> 06:52:02.890 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the federal immigration
laws

06:52:02.890 --> 06:52:02.900 align:start position:0%
laws
 
06:52:08.150 --> 06:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
including U.S 8 USC 1373
 
06:52:11.208 --> 06:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
with respect to a person who has been
 
06:52:14.570 --> 06:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
detained by or is already in lawful
 
06:52:16.250 --> 06:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
custody of
 
06:52:18.530 --> 06:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
the state County local law enforcement
 
06:52:21.948 --> 06:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
agency for a suspected violation of a
 
06:52:24.048 --> 06:52:24.058 align:start position:0%
state law to include enforcement of
 
06:52:28.670 --> 06:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:31.070 --> 06:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
can you can you
 
06:52:38.650 --> 06:52:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:42.410 --> 06:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
mandates cooperating
 
06:52:46.670 --> 06:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:48.548 --> 06:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
I think that's what I'm trying to say
 
06:52:50.930 --> 06:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative I do
 
06:52:53.690 --> 06:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
think I I I will I think I understand
 
06:52:55.490 --> 06:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to ask and I'm happy
 
06:52:57.110 --> 06:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
to answer the question I think one
 
06:52:59.208 --> 06:52:59.218 align:start position:0%
really important part of the the section
 
06:53:01.190 --> 06:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
that you just read that is important to
 
06:53:03.230 --> 06:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
remember is that it says including but
 
06:53:05.990 --> 06:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
not limited to individuals that are
 
06:53:08.090 --> 06:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
already in the custody of the police
 
06:53:10.548 --> 06:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
right I see that and so what that means
 
06:53:13.250 --> 06:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
is that anyone including people who have
 
06:53:15.350 --> 06:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
committed no crime
 
06:53:17.448 --> 06:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
or are not suspected of committing any
 
06:53:19.910 --> 06:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
crime that they have to cooperate in
 
06:53:21.468 --> 06:53:21.478 align:start position:0%
those circumstances as well it's very
 
06:53:23.628 --> 06:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
clear that this law is not limited to
 
06:53:25.850 --> 06:53:25.860 align:start position:0%
people who are already in the Detention
 
06:53:27.770 --> 06:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement so it applies to the
 
06:53:29.570 --> 06:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
innocent car passenger during a traffic
 
06:53:32.030 --> 06:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
stop it applies to the person who
 
06:53:33.948 --> 06:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
offered to interpret for the police in a
 
06:53:36.410 --> 06:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
difficult situation and these are in the
 
06:53:37.628 --> 06:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
most part we're talking about
 
06:53:41.390 --> 06:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement of civil detainers civil
 
06:53:44.868 --> 06:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
detainers are not a warrant right a
 
06:53:47.390 --> 06:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
warrant for an arrest is approved by a
 
06:53:49.010 --> 06:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
judge you have to have probable cause
 
06:53:50.448 --> 06:53:50.458 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about a civil
 
06:53:52.490 --> 06:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
immigration detainer that's one federal
 
06:53:54.770 --> 06:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
agent that has signed that civil
 
06:53:57.530 --> 06:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
detainer that we are talking about and
 
06:53:59.570 --> 06:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
potentially putting New Hampshire law
 
06:54:01.730 --> 06:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
enforcement in a place where they are
 
06:54:04.070 --> 06:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
taking people into custody on the basis
 
06:54:06.170 --> 06:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
of something one federal agent a
 
06:54:08.230 --> 06:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
document one federal agent has signed
 
06:54:11.990 --> 06:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
puts as a result really puts is is a
 
06:54:13.788 --> 06:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous place to put New Hampshire law
 
06:54:15.288 --> 06:54:15.298 align:start position:0%
enforcement in a place where they may be
 
06:54:17.868 --> 06:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
be erroneously detaining even U.S
 
06:54:20.390 --> 06:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
citizens because there have been a civil
 
06:54:22.430 --> 06:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
immigration detainers issued against U.S
 
06:54:24.468 --> 06:54:24.478 align:start position:0%
citizens in the past wrongfully into
 
06:54:24.478 --> 06:54:26.390 align:start position:0%
citizens in the past wrongfully into
custody

06:54:26.390 --> 06:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
custody
 
06:54:26.400 --> 06:54:28.850 align:start position:0%
custody
representative

06:54:28.850 --> 06:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:54:31.610 --> 06:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
Davis go ahead
 
06:54:33.110 --> 06:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:54:35.270 --> 06:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:54:35.280 --> 06:54:35.930 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:54:35.930 --> 06:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:39.190 --> 06:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any successful
 
06:54:44.690 --> 06:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:48.948 --> 06:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
am I aware of people I I think one way
 
06:54:50.270 --> 06:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
06:54:52.010 --> 06:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
question I think one way that I would
 
06:54:53.990 --> 06:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
think about that question is am I aware
 
06:54:55.610 --> 06:54:55.620 align:start position:0%
that there have been prosecutions based
 
06:54:57.650 --> 06:54:57.660 align:start position:0%
on what people have said or based on
 
06:55:00.410 --> 06:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
practice under the law or violations of
 
06:55:02.030 --> 06:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
the law that have been found and the
 
06:55:04.968 --> 06:55:04.978 align:start position:0%
answer to that is is certainly yes
 
06:55:07.490 --> 06:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:55:09.650 --> 06:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
06:55:11.868 --> 06:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:55:13.910 --> 06:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:55:16.190 --> 06:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
um on the second page
 
06:55:19.910 --> 06:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
um on line 27 the prohibition of
 
06:55:22.010 --> 06:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policies
 
06:55:25.190 --> 06:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
no state government entity no local
 
06:55:27.350 --> 06:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
government entity or law enforcement
 
06:55:30.468 --> 06:55:30.478 align:start position:0%
agent she shall knowingly enact issue
 
06:55:34.030 --> 06:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
adopt promulgate enforce permit endorse
 
06:55:37.190 --> 06:55:37.200 align:start position:0%

06:55:39.968 --> 06:55:39.978 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy
 
06:55:42.830 --> 06:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
besides law enforcement does this also
 
06:55:45.010 --> 06:55:45.020 align:start position:0%
include other
 
06:55:49.910 --> 06:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
Services uh that we provide locally and
 
06:55:53.270 --> 06:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the state like education and health
 
06:55:53.280 --> 06:55:54.250 align:start position:0%
in the state like education and health
care

06:55:54.250 --> 06:55:54.260 align:start position:0%
care
 
06:55:58.128 --> 06:55:58.138 align:start position:0%
and other social services would those
 
06:56:00.310 --> 06:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
also be
 
06:56:04.548 --> 06:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
rejected and denied these people and if
 
06:56:06.708 --> 06:56:06.718 align:start position:0%
they asked for them
 
06:56:09.048 --> 06:56:09.058 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very that thank you
 
06:56:10.730 --> 06:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative for your question I think
 
06:56:12.830 --> 06:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's a very valid point I think you
 
06:56:15.110 --> 06:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
know we have certainly seen here
 
06:56:17.690 --> 06:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
um that uh that the concern is is
 
06:56:20.270 --> 06:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
largely by law enforcement agencies in
 
06:56:22.250 --> 06:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
the state because they are our folks
 
06:56:23.690 --> 06:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
that are dealing and trying to build
 
06:56:26.810 --> 06:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
public build relationships within their
 
06:56:28.310 --> 06:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
communities on a daily basis around
 
06:56:30.110 --> 06:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
Public Safety but I think it is very
 
06:56:31.968 --> 06:56:31.978 align:start position:0%
clear from the definition of a state
 
06:56:33.468 --> 06:56:33.478 align:start position:0%
government entity that it would
 
06:56:35.208 --> 06:56:35.218 align:start position:0%
potentially apply to the other entities
 
06:56:37.730 --> 06:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
that you just listed representative
 
06:56:37.740 --> 06:56:38.868 align:start position:0%
that you just listed representative
power

06:56:38.868 --> 06:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
power
 
06:56:40.610 --> 06:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:56:42.590 --> 06:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm trying to
 
06:56:44.628 --> 06:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
understand like the process and the
 
06:56:44.638 --> 06:56:45.948 align:start position:0%
understand like the process and the
timeline

06:56:45.948 --> 06:56:45.958 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
06:56:49.910 --> 06:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
so a section on page two section seven
 
06:56:52.910 --> 06:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know we've we've focused on this
 
06:56:56.448 --> 06:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and it talks about
 
06:56:56.458 --> 06:56:57.468 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and it talks about
um

06:56:57.468 --> 06:56:57.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:57:01.070 --> 06:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
cooperation with law within the enforce
 
06:57:03.770 --> 06:57:03.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement of federal immigration law
 
06:57:07.670 --> 06:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
and it it also points to you know this
 
06:57:11.570 --> 06:57:11.580 align:start position:0%
USC but it and it also goes on to just
 
06:57:14.628 --> 06:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
to state that this with respect to a
 
06:57:17.570 --> 06:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
person who is already in custody they're
 
06:57:20.510 --> 06:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're presently being detained
 
06:57:23.330 --> 06:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
or they're already in the lawful custody
 
06:57:23.340 --> 06:57:26.030 align:start position:0%
or they're already in the lawful custody
of

06:57:26.030 --> 06:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:26.040 --> 06:57:27.530 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:57:27.530 --> 06:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:57:29.570 --> 06:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
with regard to the timeline and the
 
06:57:31.368 --> 06:57:31.378 align:start position:0%
process so we have an individual that's
 
06:57:33.708 --> 06:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
in the custom custody of local law
 
06:57:33.718 --> 06:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
in the custom custody of local law
enforcement

06:57:35.030 --> 06:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
06:57:38.390 --> 06:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
already presently then with local law
 
06:57:38.400 --> 06:57:39.590 align:start position:0%
already presently then with local law
enforcement

06:57:39.590 --> 06:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
06:57:42.288 --> 06:57:42.298 align:start position:0%
then contact ice
 
06:57:44.090 --> 06:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so much for
 
06:57:45.948 --> 06:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
your question and I know that this you
 
06:57:47.390 --> 06:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
know that the language is somewhat
 
06:57:49.250 --> 06:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
confusing but again I I think it's
 
06:57:51.288 --> 06:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
really important to be clear this is not
 
06:57:53.090 --> 06:57:53.100 align:start position:0%
limited to people in law enforcement
 
06:57:55.368 --> 06:57:55.378 align:start position:0%
custody it says including but not
 
06:57:58.250 --> 06:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
limited to right in that section that
 
06:58:00.410 --> 06:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
you just cited and what that means is
 
06:58:02.448 --> 06:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
that this provision doesn't just apply
 
06:58:04.910 --> 06:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
to people who have already been detained
 
06:58:06.890 --> 06:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
by law enforcement that might be
 
06:58:08.750 --> 06:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
scandals in the way thank you excuse me
 
06:58:12.048 --> 06:58:12.058 align:start position:0%
I I understand that I understand this
 
06:58:14.930 --> 06:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
two there's two scenarios here with my
 
06:58:17.810 --> 06:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
question I thought was pretty clear is I
 
06:58:19.910 --> 06:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
was setting up the scenario in which
 
06:58:21.948 --> 06:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
there was an individual that was
 
06:58:24.650 --> 06:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
presently in custody and I wanted to
 
06:58:27.650 --> 06:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
understand how that would play out with
 
06:58:30.530 --> 06:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
regards to cooperating
 
06:58:33.048 --> 06:58:33.058 align:start position:0%
so with local law enforcement then
 
06:58:35.150 --> 06:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
contact ice and say we have this
 
06:58:37.448 --> 06:58:37.458 align:start position:0%
individual here there's there's a
 
06:58:40.850 --> 06:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
retainer then what would happen and if
 
06:58:43.670 --> 06:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
they didn't respond with the what would
 
06:58:47.448 --> 06:58:47.458 align:start position:0%
happen then with regard to that Federal
 
06:58:49.968 --> 06:58:49.978 align:start position:0%
um immigration law thank you thank you
 
06:58:51.948 --> 06:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
representative and I am doing my best to
 
06:58:53.690 --> 06:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
to answer your questions as you stated
 
06:58:56.750 --> 06:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
them um I mean I think that the rep
 
06:58:58.310 --> 06:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative the chief of the
 
06:59:01.010 --> 06:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department did sort of
 
06:59:02.690 --> 06:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
an adequate job of sort of explaining
 
06:59:04.850 --> 06:59:04.860 align:start position:0%
what his Department would do if they had
 
06:59:06.468 --> 06:59:06.478 align:start position:0%
somebody who they picked up and then
 
06:59:09.010 --> 06:59:09.020 align:start position:0%
they found out that that individual had
 
06:59:12.708 --> 06:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
a civil um a civil detainer
 
06:59:15.230 --> 06:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
um uh or it that they were that they
 
06:59:17.230 --> 06:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
were flagged in any way by immigration
 
06:59:20.628 --> 06:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
by immigration enforcement I do also
 
06:59:22.788 --> 06:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
though want to I think it's important at
 
06:59:24.530 --> 06:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
the same time to recognize that this
 
06:59:26.750 --> 06:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
would apply to for instance and this was
 
06:59:29.990 --> 06:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
a client of ours an individual who had
 
06:59:30.000 --> 06:59:30.890 align:start position:0%
a client of ours an individual who had
been

06:59:30.890 --> 06:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
been
 
06:59:34.010 --> 06:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
actually just happened to be at a
 
06:59:35.510 --> 06:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
convenience store when there was an
 
06:59:37.968 --> 06:59:37.978 align:start position:0%
issue between a police you're going Way
 
06:59:40.730 --> 06:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
Beyond the uh the question thank you
 
06:59:42.650 --> 06:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
06:59:44.810 --> 06:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
06:59:46.128 --> 06:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:59:46.138 --> 06:59:47.270 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

06:59:47.270 --> 06:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:59:49.548 --> 06:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
if this bill would be enacted with the
 
06:59:51.048 --> 06:59:51.058 align:start position:0%
governor's Council on diversity
 
06:59:53.208 --> 06:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
inclusion be at risk of being in
 
06:59:55.190 --> 06:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
06:59:58.310 --> 06:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:00.350 --> 07:00:00.360 align:start position:0%
um I I think if this work Bill were to
 
07:00:01.850 --> 07:00:01.860 align:start position:0%
be passed there would be a number of
 
07:00:04.730 --> 07:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
different government agencies that
 
07:00:07.250 --> 07:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh well that's a good question that's a
 
07:00:08.810 --> 07:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
very good question
 
07:00:10.670 --> 07:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
um representative I'm thinking through
 
07:00:12.890 --> 07:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
what the governor's Council the
 
07:00:15.110 --> 07:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
different types of policies
 
07:00:17.690 --> 07:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
um and um recommendations that the
 
07:00:20.390 --> 07:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
governor Council uh has Pat the
 
07:00:22.368 --> 07:00:22.378 align:start position:0%
governor's Council has passed and
 
07:00:24.410 --> 07:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
certainly it would seem that they would
 
07:00:26.930 --> 07:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
be recommending actions to be taken by
 
07:00:29.330 --> 07:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
local governments that are contrary to
 
07:00:33.288 --> 07:00:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:35.030 --> 07:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
07:00:38.570 --> 07:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
much down to three more so next is
 
07:00:40.968 --> 07:00:40.978 align:start position:0%
Margaret Burns
 
07:00:40.978 --> 07:00:53.628 align:start position:0%
Margaret Burns
foreign

07:00:53.628 --> 07:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:55.368 --> 07:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Margaret Burns I'm
 
07:00:56.448 --> 07:00:56.458 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
07:00:58.310 --> 07:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and we
 
07:01:00.410 --> 07:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
are here this afternoon in opposition to
 
07:01:04.490 --> 07:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 132. Senate Bill 132 is an
 
07:01:06.890 --> 07:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
override of local control local control
 
07:01:10.010 --> 07:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
exists when local officials or voters in
 
07:01:11.810 --> 07:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
communities make decisions about their
 
07:01:13.730 --> 07:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
own policies and their own ordinances
 
07:01:16.670 --> 07:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 132 overrides that ability
 
07:01:18.770 --> 07:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
to adopt policies in this particular
 
07:01:21.948 --> 07:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
area by mandating what municipalities
 
07:01:24.410 --> 07:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
are allowed to adopt or not adopt with
 
07:01:27.230 --> 07:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
respect to local policies you've heard a
 
07:01:29.990 --> 07:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
couple examples here this afternoon from
 
07:01:31.850 --> 07:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
a couple different one from a town and
 
07:01:34.250 --> 07:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
one from a city about why different
 
07:01:35.930 --> 07:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
municipalities May adopt different
 
07:01:38.270 --> 07:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
policies in this area and what the
 
07:01:40.190 --> 07:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
benefit is of those policies to the
 
07:01:41.930 --> 07:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
Greater Community including to the
 
07:01:44.208 --> 07:01:44.218 align:start position:0%
overall safety of the community so I
 
07:01:46.788 --> 07:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
will not go in depth on those arguments
 
07:01:49.548 --> 07:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
this afternoon what I do want to take a
 
07:01:52.490 --> 07:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
moment to point to is just some of the I
 
07:01:55.610 --> 07:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
think technical issues with this bill
 
07:01:57.110 --> 07:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
um assuming the committee were even
 
07:02:00.350 --> 07:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
positioned to recommend the bill as
 
07:02:01.788 --> 07:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
ought to pass which we are suggesting
 
07:02:03.590 --> 07:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
you do not there are some outstanding
 
07:02:05.628 --> 07:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
issues with the bill as written first of
 
07:02:08.810 --> 07:02:08.820 align:start position:0%
all I know that the bill is amended from
 
07:02:11.208 --> 07:02:11.218 align:start position:0%
the original version introduced in the
 
07:02:13.850 --> 07:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
Senate but on page one starting at line
 
07:02:16.670 --> 07:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
12 the term immigration detainer is
 
07:02:19.250 --> 07:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill but it is not a term
 
07:02:22.310 --> 07:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
used in the bill
 
07:02:25.310 --> 07:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
um on page two local government entity
 
07:02:28.610 --> 07:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
is very broadly defined as has been
 
07:02:30.948 --> 07:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
previously discussed this afternoon it
 
07:02:33.288 --> 07:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
is Broad to include
 
07:02:36.650 --> 07:02:36.660 align:start position:0%
um any entity of the municipality not
 
07:02:39.650 --> 07:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
just the police department or law
 
07:02:42.590 --> 07:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement entity within a municipality
 
07:02:45.890 --> 07:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
this is relevant because when you look
 
07:02:49.310 --> 07:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
at lines 27 through 29 further down on
 
07:02:52.250 --> 07:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
the page and consider the extent of the
 
07:02:54.170 --> 07:02:54.180 align:start position:0%
Mandate on municipalities under
 
07:02:57.948 --> 07:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
prohibition of sanctuary policies all of
 
07:03:00.048 --> 07:03:00.058 align:start position:0%
the different entities within a
 
07:03:02.810 --> 07:03:02.820 align:start position:0%
municipality are prohibited from
 
07:03:06.590 --> 07:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
adopting Sanctuary policies this would
 
07:03:09.170 --> 07:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
include under the terminology in our New
 
07:03:11.570 --> 07:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes not just governing
 
07:03:14.030 --> 07:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
bodies but also towns as in town
 
07:03:16.548 --> 07:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
meetings the legislative bodies that
 
07:03:18.650 --> 07:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
have the authority to act on behalf of
 
07:03:21.410 --> 07:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
towns and which are used synonymously
 
07:03:24.770 --> 07:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
with the term Town it is further deeply
 
07:03:27.890 --> 07:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
concerning that the prohibition does not
 
07:03:30.708 --> 07:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
only prohibit the adoption of policies
 
07:03:33.590 --> 07:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
or the enactment of policies but it goes
 
07:03:36.530 --> 07:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
so far as to prohibit the endorsement of
 
07:03:38.990 --> 07:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
a policy and if we're looking at this as
 
07:03:41.570 --> 07:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
a broad prohibition across an entire
 
07:03:44.330 --> 07:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
municipality all departments all bodies
 
07:03:48.070 --> 07:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
all boards we may even be talking about
 
07:03:52.010 --> 07:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
an investigatable prohibition on a
 
07:03:54.650 --> 07:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
member of a governing body endorsing the
 
07:03:57.288 --> 07:03:57.298 align:start position:0%
idea of a policy and not even going so
 
07:04:00.530 --> 07:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
far as to enact the policy equally
 
07:04:02.868 --> 07:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
concerning the definition of policy
 
07:04:06.048 --> 07:04:06.058 align:start position:0%
itself further up on the page lines 14
 
07:04:08.570 --> 07:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
through 16 which would include even
 
07:04:12.350 --> 07:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
emotion with respect to such a policy as
 
07:04:14.390 --> 07:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
well as a practice or custom whether
 
07:04:17.628 --> 07:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
written or Unwritten in conclusion one
 
07:04:19.310 --> 07:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
thing that has not been brought up is
 
07:04:21.830 --> 07:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
the complaint process it is is
 
07:04:24.350 --> 07:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
concerning and of note that a complaint
 
07:04:26.750 --> 07:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
against a municipality could be brought
 
07:04:31.010 --> 07:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
by any person line 32 rather within the
 
07:04:33.650 --> 07:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
municipality or even within the state as
 
07:04:36.708 --> 07:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
I read it it further would allow the
 
07:04:39.230 --> 07:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
filing of an anonymous complaint so this
 
07:04:40.628 --> 07:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
is a complaint that could be
 
07:04:44.810 --> 07:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
investigated and lead to a complaint and
 
07:04:47.330 --> 07:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
and costs against a municipality that
 
07:04:50.650 --> 07:04:50.660 align:start position:0%
would be anonymous and on the final page
 
07:04:54.530 --> 07:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
page three lines 11 through 13 lines 11
 
07:04:56.750 --> 07:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
through 12 would even allow for
 
07:04:59.030 --> 07:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees and costs against a
 
07:05:02.510 --> 07:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
municipality if the complaint is found
 
07:05:05.448 --> 07:05:05.458 align:start position:0%
to be valid so for reasons based on
 
07:05:07.310 --> 07:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
local control as well as technical
 
07:05:10.310 --> 07:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
issues identified within the bill nhma
 
07:05:12.890 --> 07:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
is opposed to Senate Bill 132 and asked
 
07:05:14.868 --> 07:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
that the committee recommend the bill is
 
07:05:17.390 --> 07:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
07:05:18.890 --> 07:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
07:05:21.350 --> 07:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative Brown
 
07:05:23.628 --> 07:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman um as you know
 
07:05:26.150 --> 07:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
I'm a freshman representative so maybe
 
07:05:28.010 --> 07:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
you could help clarify a term for me
 
07:05:29.930 --> 07:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
I've heard this a number of times since
 
07:05:32.628 --> 07:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
I've been in the house but uh
 
07:05:35.628 --> 07:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
the test testimony regarded uh local
 
07:05:37.788 --> 07:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
control can you clarify that for me
 
07:05:39.530 --> 07:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
because I thought that New Hampshire was
 
07:05:42.070 --> 07:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
not a local control student
 
07:05:46.430 --> 07:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
why don't we let okay thank you Margaret
 
07:05:48.288 --> 07:05:48.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question she thinks
 
07:05:51.170 --> 07:05:51.180 align:start position:0%
local controller thank you I would be
 
07:05:53.270 --> 07:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
happy to New Hampshire is not a home
 
07:05:56.090 --> 07:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
rule state which means that we do not
 
07:05:58.010 --> 07:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
automatically inherent we do not
 
07:06:00.468 --> 07:06:00.478 align:start position:0%
inherently vest all authority within
 
07:06:03.048 --> 07:06:03.058 align:start position:0%
municipalities instead we are a local
 
07:06:05.810 --> 07:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
control state where the state holds the
 
07:06:08.390 --> 07:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
authority unless and until it delegates
 
07:06:11.030 --> 07:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
the authority to municipalities and we
 
07:06:12.650 --> 07:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
have a long tradition in New Hampshire
 
07:06:15.830 --> 07:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the state delegating a wide variety
 
07:06:18.590 --> 07:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
of authority to municipalities to act on
 
07:06:21.530 --> 07:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
at the local level zoning is delegated
 
07:06:24.190 --> 07:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
to municipalities law enforcement
 
07:06:28.430 --> 07:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
welfare roads Bridges schools all of
 
07:06:31.548 --> 07:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
these extremely large and significant
 
07:06:35.208 --> 07:06:35.218 align:start position:0%
issues or or areas within New Hampshire
 
07:06:38.270 --> 07:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
law have been delegated by the state to
 
07:06:40.430 --> 07:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and so that's the
 
07:06:42.708 --> 07:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
difference between home rule versus
 
07:06:44.750 --> 07:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
local control there are states where
 
07:06:47.330 --> 07:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities inherently have authority
 
07:06:49.788 --> 07:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
unless the state takes it away and that
 
07:06:51.230 --> 07:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
is the opposite of what New Hampshire
 
07:06:51.240 --> 07:06:52.368 align:start position:0%
is the opposite of what New Hampshire
has

07:06:52.368 --> 07:06:52.378 align:start position:0%
has
 
07:06:54.830 --> 07:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
and having listened to the definition
 
07:06:57.530 --> 07:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
which was okay
 
07:07:02.330 --> 07:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
um I will say that local control
 
07:07:04.730 --> 07:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
um depending on the issue can be
 
07:07:07.610 --> 07:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
somewhat subject uh subjective because
 
07:07:11.948 --> 07:07:11.958 align:start position:0%
we've it's not it's not always uniformly
 
07:07:15.530 --> 07:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
applied and I think even Margaret would
 
07:07:17.510 --> 07:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
probably I could give some recent
 
07:07:19.368 --> 07:07:19.378 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
07:07:19.378 --> 07:07:20.810 align:start position:0%
examples of
where

07:07:20.810 --> 07:07:20.820 align:start position:0%
where
 
07:07:22.730 --> 07:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
it should have been many of the bills
 
07:07:24.708 --> 07:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
that we've done in this committee on the
 
07:07:28.010 --> 07:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
housing issues we've said local control
 
07:07:30.110 --> 07:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
no mandates from the state but there
 
07:07:33.530 --> 07:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:38.090 --> 07:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:40.730 --> 07:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
you may
 
07:07:42.708 --> 07:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure I understand
 
07:07:46.850 --> 07:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
how this bill specifically undermines
 
07:07:48.590 --> 07:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
local controller whether it really
 
07:07:51.350 --> 07:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
should be local control or home rule or
 
07:07:54.530 --> 07:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you municipalities
 
07:07:56.930 --> 07:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
have the authority and ability and they
 
07:07:59.330 --> 07:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
do make decisions at the local level
 
07:08:02.270 --> 07:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
about how to prioritize resources as
 
07:08:04.368 --> 07:08:04.378 align:start position:0%
well as how to direct their staff their
 
07:08:06.048 --> 07:08:06.058 align:start position:0%
departments their agencies and they
 
07:08:08.930 --> 07:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
adopt a variety of policies that reflect
 
07:08:10.968 --> 07:08:10.978 align:start position:0%
those decisions about how they are going
 
07:08:14.750 --> 07:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
to utilize resources and that is
 
07:08:16.670 --> 07:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
something that they inherently have as
 
07:08:19.670 --> 07:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
Authority and so this bill would take
 
07:08:22.490 --> 07:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
away that ability and say well yes you
 
07:08:25.310 --> 07:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
can make decisions about prioritizing
 
07:08:27.708 --> 07:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
and deciding how to use your staff and
 
07:08:29.810 --> 07:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
how to direct them but not in this area
 
07:08:31.610 --> 07:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
we're going to override your local
 
07:08:33.770 --> 07:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
decision making with respect to this
 
07:08:36.670 --> 07:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
type of policy
 
07:08:39.288 --> 07:08:39.298 align:start position:0%
representative color thank you thank you
 
07:08:41.208 --> 07:08:41.218 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
07:08:44.690 --> 07:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
um you just stated that this would um
 
07:08:48.468 --> 07:08:48.478 align:start position:0%
prohibit essentially prioritizing
 
07:08:50.570 --> 07:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
um one
 
07:08:54.170 --> 07:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
um cooperating in XYZ circumstance or
 
07:08:54.180 --> 07:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
um cooperating in XYZ circumstance or
not

07:08:55.430 --> 07:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:08:58.968 --> 07:08:58.978 align:start position:0%
um but my reading of this law does not
 
07:09:01.070 --> 07:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
say that it prohibits
 
07:09:03.548 --> 07:09:03.558 align:start position:0%
um prioritizing it only prohibits
 
07:09:07.610 --> 07:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
prohibiting cooperating and so
 
07:09:10.968 --> 07:09:10.978 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that there still would
 
07:09:13.610 --> 07:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
be local control to say we're going to
 
07:09:16.310 --> 07:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
prioritize this
 
07:09:19.788 --> 07:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
um and not per we're not going to
 
07:09:22.548 --> 07:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
prioritize cooperating
 
07:09:24.650 --> 07:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be you know the 50th
 
07:09:27.048 --> 07:09:27.058 align:start position:0%
thing on the list that we prioritize and
 
07:09:30.170 --> 07:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
therefore we are not prohibiting
 
07:09:32.750 --> 07:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
cooperation we just may never get to it
 
07:09:36.890 --> 07:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
that often is that the there's been
 
07:09:39.110 --> 07:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
testimony here that says that believes
 
07:09:41.090 --> 07:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
the interpretation is that this would
 
07:09:43.730 --> 07:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
require cooperation every single time
 
07:09:43.740 --> 07:09:45.350 align:start position:0%
require cooperation every single time
and

07:09:45.350 --> 07:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:09:45.360 --> 07:09:46.128 align:start position:0%
and
um

07:09:46.128 --> 07:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:09:49.250 --> 07:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
and however but the law seems to State
 
07:09:53.030 --> 07:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
you can only uh the the Restriction is
 
07:09:55.730 --> 07:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
only for prohibiting any cooperation
 
07:09:59.868 --> 07:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
would you would you um kind of expound
 
07:10:02.330 --> 07:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
on your thoughts on whether or not
 
07:10:02.340 --> 07:10:03.048 align:start position:0%
on your thoughts on whether or not
um

07:10:03.048 --> 07:10:03.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:10:05.868 --> 07:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
the prohibitation versus prioritization
 
07:10:08.868 --> 07:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
sure as you as you know representative
 
07:10:11.510 --> 07:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
we oppose all overrides on local control
 
07:10:13.730 --> 07:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
I don't think I need to say that
 
07:10:18.590 --> 07:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
um as for your question my concern is
 
07:10:20.930 --> 07:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
with sort of your example of of
 
07:10:23.090 --> 07:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
prioritizing and maybe we'll never get
 
07:10:24.468 --> 07:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
to it you know maybe we'll never
 
07:10:27.230 --> 07:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
cooperate maybe we'll never respond
 
07:10:31.128 --> 07:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
um to to that the broad definition of
 
07:10:34.670 --> 07:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
policy it it's so broad that even a
 
07:10:37.730 --> 07:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
practice or a custom that it and that is
 
07:10:41.270 --> 07:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
either written or Unwritten can lead to
 
07:10:44.628 --> 07:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
an actionable complaint that the local
 
07:10:48.548 --> 07:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
entity is in effect
 
07:10:53.270 --> 07:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
exercising a policy that violates this
 
07:10:55.910 --> 07:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
bill and that I think is part of what is
 
07:10:58.670 --> 07:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
particularly dangerous about how broad
 
07:11:03.850 --> 07:11:03.860 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:07.190 --> 07:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative yokella thank you that's
 
07:11:12.170 --> 07:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
exactly my point I think um if so you
 
07:11:15.350 --> 07:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
could have these local agencies let's
 
07:11:19.368 --> 07:11:19.378 align:start position:0%
say I don't know the school that has
 
07:11:19.378 --> 07:11:20.830 align:start position:0%
say I don't know the school that has
essentially

07:11:20.830 --> 07:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
07:11:24.948 --> 07:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
zero times in the last 50 years of
 
07:11:28.310 --> 07:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
cooperating with ice therefore maybe
 
07:11:32.410 --> 07:11:32.420 align:start position:0%
statistically have a policy
 
07:11:34.990 --> 07:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
Unwritten on
 
07:11:38.030 --> 07:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
ever brought up by anyone saying that
 
07:11:41.510 --> 07:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
they have a a sanctuary policy Sanctuary
 
07:11:42.948 --> 07:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
policy because they've never actually
 
07:11:45.468 --> 07:11:45.478 align:start position:0%
cooperated with ice
 
07:11:49.368 --> 07:11:49.378 align:start position:0%
um so therefore by statistics they have
 
07:11:50.570 --> 07:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
a policy
 
07:11:53.990 --> 07:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
and could be taken action against in in
 
07:11:56.570 --> 07:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
this interpretation possibly this is a
 
07:11:58.850 --> 07:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
very broad this is very broad language
 
07:12:02.270 --> 07:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:03.948 --> 07:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
representative status
 
07:12:05.690 --> 07:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
07:12:08.090 --> 07:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
07:12:11.810 --> 07:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
um this bill it is not yet a law
 
07:12:14.048 --> 07:12:14.058 align:start position:0%
um talks about
 
07:12:18.190 --> 07:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
endorsements Unwritten policies
 
07:12:21.288 --> 07:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
you know broad definitions of what
 
07:12:23.830 --> 07:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
constitutes the divisions I mean
 
07:12:27.708 --> 07:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
municipality in your view do you see any
 
07:12:30.170 --> 07:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
abridgement of First Amendment rights
 
07:12:32.810 --> 07:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
here when you're talking let's say I'm a
 
07:12:34.670 --> 07:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
member of the Lebanon planning board and
 
07:12:36.350 --> 07:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm talking to a colleague and I say you
 
07:12:38.150 --> 07:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
know I think Sanctuary cities aren't a
 
07:12:39.650 --> 07:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
bad thing
 
07:12:42.650 --> 07:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
could somebody Institute a complaint If
 
07:12:43.968 --> 07:12:43.978 align:start position:0%
This Were
 
07:12:46.610 --> 07:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
passed and became law could somebody
 
07:12:48.770 --> 07:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
Institute a complaint against
 
07:12:52.250 --> 07:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
me personally the city of Lebanon how
 
07:12:54.770 --> 07:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
would that even work
 
07:12:57.468 --> 07:12:57.478 align:start position:0%
governments do have the First Amendment
 
07:12:59.628 --> 07:12:59.638 align:start position:0%
right to speak on their own behalf that
 
07:13:01.128 --> 07:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
is that is part of the First Amendment
 
07:13:03.410 --> 07:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
so I do think that there is a concern
 
07:13:07.150 --> 07:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
there that you're raising the complaint
 
07:13:10.128 --> 07:13:10.138 align:start position:0%
process I don't know if it would be
 
07:13:11.690 --> 07:13:11.700 align:start position:0%
further established by the Attorney
 
07:13:14.270 --> 07:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
General's office to be more than these
 
07:13:17.990 --> 07:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
few paragraphs here in the bill but I do
 
07:13:20.930 --> 07:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
think again that this broad language
 
07:13:24.530 --> 07:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
that defines what it means to have a
 
07:13:27.530 --> 07:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy that refers even to
 
07:13:27.540 --> 07:13:29.270 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy that refers even to
endorsing

07:13:29.270 --> 07:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
endorsing
 
07:13:34.010 --> 07:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
um such a policy it's it's a concerning
 
07:13:36.948 --> 07:13:36.958 align:start position:0%
um it's concerning with respect to open
 
07:13:41.750 --> 07:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:44.030 --> 07:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
so you know my questions thank you very
 
07:13:44.040 --> 07:13:45.048 align:start position:0%
so you know my questions thank you very
much

07:13:45.048 --> 07:13:45.058 align:start position:0%
much
 
07:13:51.890 --> 07:13:51.900 align:start position:0%

Ice that's the murkiness that we're
 
07:16:22.010 --> 07:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
hearing about in this hearing
 
07:16:24.650 --> 07:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
um the broad scope that people are
 
07:16:25.788 --> 07:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
07:16:29.330 --> 07:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
living a lot up to interpretation
 
07:16:32.448 --> 07:16:32.458 align:start position:0%
to not do this if such an interpretation
 
07:16:35.208 --> 07:16:35.218 align:start position:0%
would be make them guilty of acting on a
 
07:16:37.788 --> 07:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
sanctuary policy the Manchester Police
 
07:16:40.310 --> 07:16:40.320 align:start position:0%

citizens
 
07:16:45.288 --> 07:16:45.298 align:start position:0%

Cooperative relationship
 
07:16:50.270 --> 07:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
with the Manchester Community especially
 
07:16:53.510 --> 07:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the Inner City Community where many
 
07:16:55.250 --> 07:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
immigrants live
 
07:16:57.350 --> 07:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
it is a difficult
 
07:17:01.010 --> 07:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
task and an ongoing challenge as many
 
07:17:03.650 --> 07:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
immigrants come from countries where the
 
07:17:06.350 --> 07:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
police cannot be trusted and are
 
07:17:09.708 --> 07:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
understandably feared
 
07:17:11.690 --> 07:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
here in Manchester the police are
 
07:17:15.288 --> 07:17:15.298 align:start position:0%
working to overcome this fear and
 
07:17:18.350 --> 07:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
distrust and if this bill passes I think
 
07:17:21.350 --> 07:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
it would be a negative impact on the
 
07:17:21.360 --> 07:17:22.730 align:start position:0%
it would be a negative impact on the
city

07:17:22.730 --> 07:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
city
 
07:17:25.010 --> 07:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
can I add one thing
 
07:17:27.110 --> 07:17:27.120 align:start position:0%

seconds okay Pittsburgh New Hampshire

foreign

07:19:13.910 --> 07:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:15.410 --> 07:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
07:19:19.548 --> 07:19:19.558 align:start position:0%
um just a heads up look as of right now
 
07:19:23.868 --> 07:19:23.878 align:start position:0%
uh tentative it's not been put into uh
 
07:19:26.628 --> 07:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
hard writing yet but looking at a May
 
07:19:30.708 --> 07:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
10th as our probable exact day that's a
 
07:19:30.718 --> 07:19:33.650 align:start position:0%
10th as our probable exact day that's a
Wednesday

07:19:33.650 --> 07:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:35.628 --> 07:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
so that's tentative but probably will
 
07:19:38.650 --> 07:19:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:42.230 --> 07:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
so other than that
 
07:19:46.070 --> 07:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is the May 10th
 
07:19:48.410 --> 07:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh would be at 10 o'clock that's correct
 
07:19:51.708 --> 07:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
we would have a caucus prior but again
 
07:19:51.718 --> 07:19:53.030 align:start position:0%
we would have a caucus prior but again
tentative

07:19:53.030 --> 07:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
tentative
 
07:19:55.368 --> 07:19:55.378 align:start position:0%
all right everybody good have a good
 
07:19:55.378 --> 07:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
