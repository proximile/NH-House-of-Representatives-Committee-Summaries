okay folks like i'd like to get started
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
with this is
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
we're having a
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
full committee work session on interim
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
study bills we are
 
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 align:start position:0%
not going to
 
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.509 align:start position:0%
not going to
[Music]

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
dispose of any bill
 
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.229 align:start position:0%
dispose of any bill
today

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is our start to be able
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
to see where we want to go as a
 
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee with the with these bills
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be
 
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
dividing up things if we have a any
 
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh bills any uh
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
what we will do with each each of these
 
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
bills some bills we will
 
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
lump into uh
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
one one subcommittee others will be by
 
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
one one subcommittee others will be by
themselves

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh and others will not have any sub
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
committee they will just go to the uh
 
00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.150 align:start position:0%
committee they will just go to the uh
a

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
well before 26 and 257 were relative

pollutants from uh
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
septic systems uh there are two bills
 
00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
septic systems uh there are two bills
that

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
deal with this subject
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i uh we asked mr dears to
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
give us a uh give bring us all up to
 
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.309 align:start position:0%
give us a uh give bring us all up to
speed

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
speed
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
as to the
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
what what the science is and what the
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
need is and things of that nature
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
mr dears
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
the floor is yours
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you members of
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
the committee it's great to be with you
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
again i think everyone's looking
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
refreshed after a little bit of time
 
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
between the session uh so i hope you're
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
all having a great summer um i am very
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
pleased to talk to you a little bit
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
today um about sort of the um
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna call it the great bass saga uh
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
because it's been going on for so long
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
and because many of you
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
are relatively new on the committee um
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
it may be that you haven't heard uh the
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
saga i'm not gonna do it as an ode or
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
anything like that or in you know a song
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh as as perhaps we probably should at
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
this point but i'm gonna just tell you a
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
little bit about the history of sort of
 
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
how we got here
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is to talk a
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
little bit about why uh senate bill 257
 
00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
is a thing
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
and so i know senator waters is uh is a
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
sponsor of that and he is behind me here
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that he can also wax
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
eloquent about the reasons for this bill
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to give it just a quick
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
shot as to kind of how we got here so
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
back in the early 2000s
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
we started doing the state of the
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
estuary reports and this came from the
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
piscataqua region estuaries partnership
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that happened as
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
doing those is there a bunch of
 
00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.390 align:start position:0%
doing those is there a bunch of
indicators

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
indicators
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
indicators of estuary health
 
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
indicators of estuary health
so

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
just to define my terms an estuary is
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
simply a place where freshwater meets
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
saltwater and the great bay is our
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
largest of estuaries and it's pretty a
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
significant resource nationally as well
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
as regional
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
so the great bay was starting to show
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
signs of stress through these indicators
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
and one of the primary ones was the loss
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
of eelgrass so eelgrass is a submerged
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
aquatic vegetation zastromuridima for
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
those of you who like the latin names uh
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
it's quite fun to say not as fun as a
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
muffle of breville gilada which is beach
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
grass but almost as fun um and so
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
so eelgrass is a fundamental basis of
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
the ecosystem of the estuary it's where
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
the fish hang out it's where fish have
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
nurseries there's flounder have their
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
babies in there we have
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's shellfish it cleans the water so
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
as it waves it's very long and wavy and
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
as it waves its its leaves and and stems
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
in the water it captures sediment it
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
takes up nutrients
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
and so that was declining precipitously
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
in great bail by between 1996 and around
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
2000 2004 about half of the eelgrass in
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
great bay was gone
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so they started looking at this and
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that also came up at
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
the same time looking at all these
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
different indicators is that nutrients
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
nitrogen in particular have increased
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
dramatically over time
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the things we know from the
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
research around the world is that
 
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.070 align:start position:0%
research around the world is that
nitrogen

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
nitrogen
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
too much nitrogen and estuary tends to
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
impact the eel eelgrass
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
which has lots of different than it's
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's basically a a a positive
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
reinforcement um it's a a positive
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
feedback loop positive meaning that that
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
one thing causes the other leaves of the
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
other lays the other
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
and so when you start to lose the when
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
you start to get too much nutrients you
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
start to have less light
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
when you have less light the eelgrass
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
don't get as much light
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then the eelgrass start to die
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
which then causes you to not trap as
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
much sediments then you have less light
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
which causes more eelgrass to die which
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
causes the estuary to sort of go into
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
this downward spiral
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
so we had good indications at the time
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
that this was going on
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
as a result of that we launched a fairly
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
monumental effort to develop
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
ideas about how much nutrients would
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
have to be reduced in order to
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
in order to get the estuary to be
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
healthy again
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
as a result of that we started to see
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
numbers coming out and understanding a
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what would need to
 
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
be reduced and from where it was coming
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's a chart a color chart in the
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
middle of your
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh of your packet there that looks a
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
little bit like
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
um pac-man uh eating one of those fun
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
dots that pac-man eat
 
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
dots that pac-man eat
and

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
that colored chart there shows you sort
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
of where does all this nitrogen come
 
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.069 align:start position:0%
of where does all this nitrogen come
from

00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:10:56.079 --> 00:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
from
so

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
only about about a third or so comes
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
from wastewater treatment plants so each
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
of us every every year each of us
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
creates about seven pounds of nitrogen
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh through our bodily functions
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
that nitrogen all goes to wastewater
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
treatment plants or your septic system
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
or you know hopefully those are the two
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
places it goes and um
 
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
places it goes and um
that

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
that then has to get treated and that
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
nitrogen is generally because of the way
 
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
that our wastewater treatment plants
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
were created they were not meant to
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
treat for nitrogen
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
so the nitrogen pretty much went through
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
the plants and into the estuary and
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's what was one of the sources
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the rest of the 75 or so or 70 percent
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
comes from other things comes from
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
atmospheric deposition we get a lot of
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
nitrogen that comes from uh the midwest
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
through power plants uh you've heard of
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
when we talk about acid rain you've
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
heard of nox and socks um you know
 
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
heard of nox and socks um you know
nitric

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
nitric
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
oxides and sulfur oxides you know those
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
are not just dr seuss terms nox and
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
socks they are these pollutants and
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
nitrogen uh precipitates falls onto the
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
ground and that washes off into off of
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
pavement and into our estuaries most of
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
it is taken up in forests this is one of
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
the reasons why it's great that we have
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
so many forests
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
takes up that nitrogen
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
so that nitrogen has to go somewhere
 
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
also nitrogen comes from fertilizers not
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
as much here in terms of agriculture but
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
certainly uh one of the studies we did
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
showed that we have about 45 000 acres
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
of lawn in the great bay watershed
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
much of which gets fertilizer much of
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
which has nitrogen in it so all of this
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
combines and so
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
by the time we got to the sort of 2010s
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
it was very clear that there needed to
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
be reductions
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
so epa who writes our permits here for
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire began looking at what
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
would we have to do
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the problems with this whole
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
thing is that epa really only has its
 
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
thing is that epa really only has its
hooks

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
hooks
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
into the wastewater treatment plants
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have its hooks into those
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
other sources that i suggested
 
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
so what the so what epa because that's
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
their one hook they began proposing to
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
do draconian reductions at our
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
reductions that would be extraordinarily
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
expensive to meet
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
and so as a result of that
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
the state and the communities uh became
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
lots and lots and lots and lots of
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
discussions over the ensuing 10 years or
 
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.190 align:start position:0%
discussions over the ensuing 10 years or
so

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
epa agreed to take a completely novel
 
00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.829 align:start position:0%
epa agreed to take a completely novel
approach

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
this is novel for the nation no one else
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
has done this in this way and what they
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
did was they created this great bay
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
nitrogen general permit
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
so what they did was they took the
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
nitrogen part out of the whole permit
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
system that normally wastewater
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
treatment plants are permitted under and
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
created this general permit that applies
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
to the 13 wastewater treatment plants
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
and their communities around the great
 
00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:53.910 align:start position:0%
and their communities around the great
bay

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
bay
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
and what that innovative approach did
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
was it set an end of the pipe limit but
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
the end of the pipe is the end of the
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
piscataqua river so it basically looks
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
at the whole watershed looks at how much
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
nitrogen is coming down on the whole
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
watershed and then attempts to regulate
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
that based on the whole thing instead of
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
each sort of facility
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
so then they back that up into each sort
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
of what each facility was contributing
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then allowed them to lock in the
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
good work and the investments that
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
they'd been making over the last 10
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
years and just be clear the communities
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
around great b great bay have dug in you
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
know that portsmouth spent 94 million
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
dollars on a new wastewater treatment
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
plant at pierce island that has
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
excellent nitrogen treatment exeter
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
small exeter spent 54 million dollars
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
rochester has taken their nitrogen from
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
40 micrograms per liter down to four
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
micrograms per liter
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is amazing they've done amazing
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
work huge investments that have gone on
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
but it's not quite enough in order
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
because they're only 30 of the problem
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
so the idea with this great bayonet
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
great bay nitrogen general permit was to
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
be able to build in a system of
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
trade-offs that system of trade-off
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
trade-offs does not exist within the
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
clean water act
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
so this is a new tool that was developed
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
for this purpose it is voluntary
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
the communities have can voluntarily go
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
into this
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
and if they voluntarily go into this
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
then they they have to do a few things
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
they have to contribute to monitoring so
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
how what's actually going on in the
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
estuary they have to track the nitrogen
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
that they're emitting from their
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
communities so we built a system des
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
funded it to build a system that tracks
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
their pollutants so any subdivision that
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
goes in or a redevelopment project
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's putting in new
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
best management practices all of that is
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
tracked within this this um this this
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
database in fact newmarket has done
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
phenomenally uh and we've tracked those
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
reductions uh that they've made from for
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
in in this case they hooked their
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
elementary school
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
instead of all the wastewater going into
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
the into the to right to the estuary
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
they put in infiltration basins they did
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
some other things which disconnected all
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
of that impervious remember all the
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
nitrogen that's falling from the sky and
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
landing on the on that pavement
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
so the communities have to track what
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing they also develop a
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
nitrogen reduction plan that addresses
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
those other sources other than their
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
so they're looking at all of those other
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
sources so
 
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
dover right now when they put in a new
 
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.230 align:start position:0%
dover right now when they put in a new
road

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
road
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
when they dig up the side they don't
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
just put it back with the same
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
storm drain basins they've actually
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
invented their own sort of water
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
treatment system that goes in front of
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the storm drains that actually
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
causes the nitrogen to essentially
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
filter out as it goes through
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
as well as other pollutants
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's not just about nitrogen when you
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
start talking about storm water it's
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
about flooding it's about it's about
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
other night other you know phosphorus
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's about other pollutants bacteria
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
that would be in the water so it's a
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
win-win-win when you do that because not
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
only are you improving your your your
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
aged infrastructure
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
but you're reducing flooding and you get
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
that pollution benefit as well at the
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
same time this is why this trade-off is
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
so important
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
but this is also this is where we get to
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
this requires you to use a silver
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
buckshot approach
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
right there's no silver bullet it's a
 
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
silver buckshot approach
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
so what you need to do is find all of
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
the places that you can possibly reduce
 
00:17:31.919 --> 00:17:33.510 align:start position:0%
the places that you can possibly reduce
nitrogen

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
nitrogen
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that each of us creates
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
about seven pounds of nitrogen a year
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
if you're on a septic system your septic
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
system does a remarkable job
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
at pulling out all kinds of things out
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the water it pulls out phosphorus it
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
treats the bacteria it it even is pretty
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
good at doing things like
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals and personal care
 
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.870 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals and personal care
products

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
lots of those things get get caught up
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
and treated very nicely in your septic
 
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.390 align:start position:0%
and treated very nicely in your septic
system

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
nitrogen goes into solution
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
and septic systems are extremely good at
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
taking things that are in solution and
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
putting them into the ground that's what
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're built to do
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
so septic systems the straight up
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
well-functioning modern septic system is
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
extremely good at putting nitrogen
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
directly into the groundwater
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
so when we start talking about can you
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
address this so for example in dover
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
they have a certain population outside
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
of the the main downtown area that is on
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
septic systems
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
so as they start to think about again a
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
silver buckshot approach how would they
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
start to address putting in expensive
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
upgrades to those systems
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
without requiring the those those people
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
who owned them to spend that kind of
 
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.070 align:start position:0%
who owned them to spend that kind of
money

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
that's where this idea about a septic
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
utility comes from
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
how would the community so the community
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
dover could
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
come to the srf program at des
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
get some loan forgiveness
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
as part of that put that into their
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
normal operating budget as the community
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
and then create basically a utility
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
around that that would put in a an
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
upgraded system that would treat for
 
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.430 align:start position:0%
upgraded system that would treat for
nitrogen

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
nitrogen
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
it would do the maintenance on that
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
system every year make sure that it's
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's working
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
the people attached to it would pay
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
would probably pay a fee like you'd pay
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
a sewer fee
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
but you would no longer have to be
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for pumping it out you'd no
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
longer be responsible for replacing it
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
if it broke
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
someone else would do that
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
so if they went down that road and it
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
would take the vote of the the city
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
council and input from all the you know
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
people in town as as part of the public
 
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.270 align:start position:0%
people in town as as part of the public
process

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
if they decided to do that then they
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
would get credits remember i said we
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
built this system where they can track
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
their nitrogen
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
this would be one of the things that
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
they would be able to track
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
and at the end of this permit what
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
they're required to show is that they
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
did what they could to reduce nitrogen
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
and see what's going on in the estuary
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
and we we hope and we think that when we
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
get to the end of that we're going to
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
see major improvements in the ecology of
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
great bay
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's where this bill comes out of it's
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
out of that desire
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
i think this is going to be very very
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
rare that this gets employed i've also
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
talked to some folks around some lake
 
00:20:23.039 --> 00:20:24.149 align:start position:0%
talked to some folks around some lake
communities

00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
that have say a small neighborhood
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
that all you know was all put in at the
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
maybe the developer wasn't so reputable
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
the septic systems are all failing and
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
that may be another place where that
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
community wants to get together maybe
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
even a neighborhood sort of association
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
build a stormwater utility which the you
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
know the law would allow that to happen
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
and be able to then access funding
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
because currently an individual
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
homeowner unless you're very poor there
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
are very few avenues to access funding
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
for septic system replacement this would
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
be a place in which that that new
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
district that utility
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
could go after srf funds they could get
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
grants they could do other things that
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
would allow them to spread those
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
payments out and allow people to replace
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
their systems without having to you know
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know pay a huge amount up front
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
which is very challenging for people to
 
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.270 align:start position:0%
which is very challenging for people to
do

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
so that's really the essence of 257 and
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know i i just wanted to i'll stop
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
there and see if people have questions i
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
gave you some materials to just kind of
 
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.310 align:start position:0%
gave you some materials to just kind of
show

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
show
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
you know what do we know about eelgrass
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh there's a little chart there on the
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
front what do we know about total
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
nitrogen that's from the chico river and
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
you can see that since rochester and
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
dover um have been doing so much better
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
especially rochester here in the kachico
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
since they've been doing so much better
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
at reducing the nitrogen you see the
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
nitrogen reductions in the river
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
so we're tracking what's going on there
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
the second page i put in just a couple
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
of little factoids about what a storm
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
water utility is kind of why those exist
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are involved in
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
concord the concord is looking at a
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
storm water utility
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
the primary reason there is that
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
something like 40 of the pavement in
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
this city is either owned is is
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
untaxable by the city
 
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.230 align:start position:0%
untaxable by the city
so

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
that means that all of the runoff is
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
paid for by the by the good people of
 
00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:19.190 align:start position:0%
paid for by the by the good people of
concord

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
in their taxes
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
whereas to treat that storm water in a
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
utility everyone would pay
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit and it would you know be
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
able to to raise more dollars to deal
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
with the serious problems that exist
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
with aging infrastructure as well as
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
spread that across the
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
people who are currently untaxed
 
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
um and i sort of talked a little bit
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
about the septic utility and then you
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
know one of the other things that's come
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
up is septic impacts on lakes
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
and i can certainly talk more about that
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
in the context of
 
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.029 align:start position:0%
in the context of
hb426

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
hb426
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
but you know we are definitely in a
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
situation in which cyanobacteria blooms
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
are getting worse and worse this year
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
the first time we had two water supply
 
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.110 align:start position:0%
the first time we had two water supply
lakes

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
lakes
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
that had cyanobacteria blooms
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
so this is very scary stuff because of
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
the toxins involved in the cyanobacteria
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
so um you know i think this is another
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
place in which there needs to be some
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
some thought addressing uh potential
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
pollution sources into our our lakes
 
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.750 align:start position:0%
pollution sources into our our lakes
so

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to stop there and see if
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr dears for an excellent
 
00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.669 align:start position:0%
thank you mr dears for an excellent
presentation

00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
i wanted to
 
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
just get some clarification on the
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
home septic systems sure you said if
 
00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
home septic systems sure you said if
this

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
if a community were to
 
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.830 align:start position:0%
if a community were to
[Music]

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh take advantage of this enabling
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
legislation if this bill were to become
 
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.990 align:start position:0%
legislation if this bill were to become
law

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
or something similar you said um
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
in lake communities where septic systems
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
are failing
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
this could help the homeowner whose
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
system was failing
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
say for instance if it was
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
installed poorly
 
00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:11.990 align:start position:0%
installed poorly
um

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
some remediation financial remediation
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then you i thought you said that
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be having to pump their
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
tanks themselves anymore
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
so could you clarify how this would work
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
yeah again i think this is going to be
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
super rare that this happens but it will
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
happen on occasion i can picture
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
i can picture any number of
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods around lakes they were all
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
kind of put in at the same time and
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
their all their septic systems are
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
failing at the same time
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
it's pretty common
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that could
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
happen is say that group that homeowner
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
group decides that they want to build a
 
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.669 align:start position:0%
group decides that they want to build a
district

00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
basically a utility
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
and when you do that because these
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
systems again if you're going to go with
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
some advanced systems or something like
 
00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.390 align:start position:0%
some advanced systems or something like
that

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
you could have the utility handle all of
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
the maintenance on that and in fact you
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
would want to do that to protect your
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
your investment it would be similar to
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
us to a wastewater system that now um
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know they they treat the pipes all
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
the way to your house
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
they do other things this would be sort
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
of that next step where they would
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually you know depending on how the
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
utility is set up they would most likely
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
do the maintenance on that so you'd pay
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
a fee into it every year and that would
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
pay the the amortization of you know the
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
cost of the putting all these systems in
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
as well as it would fund the maintenance
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
that's assist that's a place in which
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
that would definitely need all of the
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
homeowners to agree that that's what
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
they want to do
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
this is why i think it's going to be
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
really rare
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
um but i think it's going to be really
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
helpful in certain circumstances in
 
00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:48.559 align:start position:0%
which there are a few other options
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
sewering is not an option for example um
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
there are parts of lake winnipesaukee
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
that you know the winosaki basin project
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
didn't go all the way around the lake so
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's whole areas that don't have and
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's some tight neighborhoods in
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
there that could potentially do this
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
um and then of course i think great bay
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
was the focus that was the original way
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill was written was for those
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
great bay communities and that's kind of
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
the description i think which is
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
probably more likely in the short run
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
would be you know as part of a larger
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
effort a larger system that would you
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
know be pulling some of those in
 
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
know be pulling some of those in
thanks

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.170 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
for a question representative here we go
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
um so this uh
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
this system that's being put in
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
um is it like a mini wastewater
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
treatment plant
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
what is it so thank you for the question
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
representative spang um
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
what they have is a number of different
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of systems and the whole the way
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
that you get nitrogen out of water
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
is that you have to alternate back and
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
forth between
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
an anaerobic environment and an aerobic
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
environment your septic system is only
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
anaerobic there's not much oxygen down
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
so what happens is essentially it would
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
go into some sort of a
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
mechanical system
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
be small you know because it's part of
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
you just part of your septic system but
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
it would have some way of introducing
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
oxygen back into the system at some
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
point in the process
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
some of them are more elaborate than
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
others so some of them would have ways
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
of recirculating some of the waste back
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
in through the system because the more
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
you can because what happens is that as
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
you put air in then there's bacteria
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
natural bacteria that take the nitrogen
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
and deny and denitrify it which means
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
that they send it up into the oxygen our
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
oxygen as you all know is mostly
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
nitrogen our our atmosphere is mostly
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
oxide is mostly nitrogen not oxygen
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
anyway um so it sends it up into the
 
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.430 align:start position:0%
anyway um so it sends it up into the
atmosphere

00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
atmosphere
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
in order what happens then is as those
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
little bugs are chewing up the nitrogen
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
they chew up all the carbon because
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
that's their fuel and so you have
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to have a way of
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
putting more carbon back in which is
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
coming back out of your waste that's how
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
a waste or treatment plant works but
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
this is really it's it would look mostly
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
like a septic system but might have a
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
little mechanical structure that would
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
sit you know as part some at some point
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
in the process that's how some of these
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
work there's other ones that are now
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
being laid out that are more passive
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
where they put a layer of wood chips or
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
other kinds of carbon media underneath
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
your leech field and that has the effect
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
of again being able to have some of that
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
carbon to be able to take up
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
for the question further question thank
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
you so
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
i had envisioned all of these houses
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
being hooked up to a central
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
plant but it's actually occurring on
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
each septic system
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
on the shoreland
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
commission that i chaired
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
we talked a lot about innovative systems
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
particularly for areas that were very
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
close to the shore and where you really
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't put in a decent septic system
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
how does that relate to this utility
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's very similar um the the the
 
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.750 align:start position:0%
it's very similar um the the the
treatments

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
the treatment protocols for phosphorus
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
are different than they are for nitrogen
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
so around a lake you're talking about it
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
but it's a similar kind of system
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know it'd be similar sort of sort of
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
approach where you have
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
some sort of system and most likely it
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
includes some sort of mechanical
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
parts this is why the maintenance
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
becomes so critical this is why a
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
utility becomes critical is that you
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
basically have to have a some sort of
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
third party maintenance to keep this to
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
keep them going and the homeowner is you
 
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
know because they're they move
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
most people a lot of people buy a house
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
they don't even know where the septic
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
system is
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
they don't even know that they have a
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
so often so you know it that's why this
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
kind of thing becomes necessary is to
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
have that kind of centralized
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to be able to deal with
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
that so that that's kind of where it
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
works one more clarification thank you
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
so the um
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
would this utility pay for a landowner
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
a property owner to upgrade from a
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
standard system
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
to one of these innovative systems
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's generally what would be involved
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
especially like take the great bay
 
00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:24.950 align:start position:0%
especially like take the great bay
example

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
take the dover example so they would
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
identify say an area of the town that
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
would have the highest potential for
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
reduction of nitrogen because remember
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
the towns are going this is a value
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
engineering proposition okay they're
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
doing whatever is the least
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
cost next pound of nitrogen removal
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
so that's the that's the whole premise
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
here it's not that they're targeting one
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
thing or another because it because of
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
of some reason it's because they're char
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're targeting the next pound of
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
cheapest nitrogen it's pure economics
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
and so if the next pound of cheapest
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
nitrogen to get out
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
is through some set of septic systems
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the cost of that given the whole
 
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
replacement of the system
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know the maintenance of the system
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
doing all of that makes sense
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
then and then there's grants and there's
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
and there's there's loans to be able to
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
that may be the cheapest next pound and
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
so that's where this would come into
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
play it wouldn't be willy-nilly it would
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
be as a result of that kind of analysis
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
i have a question yes sir
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
yeah being being kind of slow i need to
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh does this mean
 
00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:45.029 align:start position:0%
uh does this mean
that

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
we can forget about
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh leech fields from now on
 
00:31:50.159 --> 00:31:51.190 align:start position:0%
uh leech fields from now on
so

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chair
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
the answer is no
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
for for the vast majority of people
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
anywhere you you are in the state who
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
has a septic system
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
that system is
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
perfectly adequate
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
and even if you had an advanced system
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
almost always you would also have a
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
leech field of some sort so you still
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
have to get the water back into the
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
ground somewhere you're still not you
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
can't make the water disappear
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it's highly unlikely that you would
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
have the system that would go into the
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
little treatment hut we'll call it a
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
treatment hut the treatment cabana that
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
would be in your backyard and then that
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
water would then flow directly into a
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
lake that would never happen you would
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
still be nest needing to put that water
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
back into the ground and the best way to
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
put that back into the ground is through
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
a leech field because it spreads it out
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it has a media underneath it that
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
continues to even give it more treatment
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
for those of you who haven't seen a
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
septic system get dug up
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
i recommend you see it at some point
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
because the the the engine of treatment
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
that treat the thing that treats all the
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
bacteria and all the other nasties that
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
are coming coming out of the house
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
is this almost microscopic thin layer of
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
biological film that occurs on the
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
outside of the stones at the bottom of
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
your leech field
 
00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:15.190 align:start position:0%
your leech field
it's

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
truly magical how this system works i
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
know i get excited about substances but
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just a hole in the ground in
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
which one pours water
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
these are highly engineered well thought
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
out and they're biological engines that
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
are that are that are truly a miracle of
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
any other questions by
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.470 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
representatives

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
actually mr chair um
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
are we also going to discuss the other
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
bill um 426 or is this a combined
 
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.350 align:start position:0%
bill um 426 or is this a combined
discussion

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairs i'd like to
 
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you also for pointing out the work
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
that rochester's done my hometown
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
and uh because i know over the years
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
that i served on the city council we did
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of work on getting our water
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
quality and wastewater treatment plant
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
to be one of the best in the state of
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and it's great to be
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
pointed but it's also at the beginning
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's been millions of dollars to the
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
ratepayers in the in the community
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
and it's also interesting because i've
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
done a lot of research in looking at
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
sequencing back batch reactors if for
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
small uses
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
and uh because i know it's something
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
that's been significantly done in
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
western massachusetts for
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
residential communities or downtown
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
areas that they don't have the septic
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
systems available to them
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of innovative stuff
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
out here do you see these bills as being
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
a way to encourage more of that to occur
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative um and um
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
and rochester's fantastic they're doing
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
they really are doing innovative stuff
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
in rochester
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know i guess that's the
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
answer is that that there's a lot of
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
people looking at decentralized systems
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
in lots of new ways
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
um for for a lot of reasons cost
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know the amount of treatment that
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
has to happen
 
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.670 align:start position:0%
has to happen
um

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know the cost of a new wastewater
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
treatment plant
 
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.950 align:start position:0%
treatment plant
is

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know for you know a million gallons
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
a day is is on the order of 25 million
 
00:35:25.119 --> 00:35:26.230 align:start position:0%
a day is is on the order of 25 million
dollars

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of communities that
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
just aren't going to have that kind of
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
money so
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know this is
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
these there are a lot of new treatment
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh technologies that are being developed
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
um worldwide uh to deal with the the
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
issue of human waste so
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
you know potentially so you could say
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
like if you had a number of of
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
decentralized villages say for example
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
and each of them
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know wanted to do some sort of a
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
system you could again develop some sort
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
of a utility that would deal with that
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
um so i don't know i mean that i think
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
that that's sort of you know speculative
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
at this point i don't think we're there
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
yet but with the housing issue that we
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
have here in the state there's a lot of
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
areas that could sustain additional
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
housing and high density higher density
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
housing if there was a way to treat the
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
wastewater because that seems to be when
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the calculations for
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size for housing units
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
and the number of bedrooms you have on a
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
site sometimes it becomes prohibitively
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
expensive to be able to to make a
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
compact compact housing
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
and to be able to do these you know i
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
just want to i know that batch reactors
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
have been out there for years i've been
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
looking at them for over 20 years and
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
having those
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to support
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
increased density and housing in some
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
areas which would normally not be able
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
to switch would it you know would it be
 
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.630 align:start position:0%
to switch would it you know would it be
affordable

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
as i said a lot of places in western
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts have done them uh to
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
support that and and in some very
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
innovative ways at a far reduced cost to
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
spending 25 million dollars to build a
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
sewage treatment plant
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
so it's something that we possibly
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
should be looking at
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the short term in order to try to
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
bring these technologies to the state or
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and using more of them
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
yeah you know i think that community
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
systems are incredibly important you see
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
this a lot at um you know at uh co-op
 
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.150 align:start position:0%
this a lot at um you know at uh co-op
communities

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
where in a spa and this is one of the
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
problems that we have right now one of
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
the reasons why des is allocating a
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount of both arpa and
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure money towards
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised communities is towards
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
the co-ops that oftentimes when they
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
bought up the co-op
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
the the systems that were there had not
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
been maintained and so they're
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
installing community systems and i
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
certainly think that there's an
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity in the future for either
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
having you know sort of a utility
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
approach to their community systems
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
either multiple systems or being able to
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
have some innovative approaches to being
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
able to deal with that but that's you
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
know i think that's really that's in my
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
mind that's where the first place
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
where you're going to see that kind of
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
approach is is out of necessity in some
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
of these especially you know places that
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
just when they bought when they bought
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
up their their their co-op
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know it was at the outside edge of
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
what people could afford and then you
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
have a water and sewer problem on top of
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
that and that's what really becomes a
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
problem uh for folks and we've seen that
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um the
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to raise some of the issues of
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues in terms of the
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
cost to the private property owner
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
i i think a lot of us myself included
 
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
thought that this was going to be
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
something that was going to be say
 
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.230 align:start position:0%
something that was going to be say
citywide

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
citywide
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
so the the council would be approving it
 
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.109 align:start position:0%
so the the council would be approving it
um

00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
you you would be dragged in by the
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
majority whether whether or not you
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
but you're saying that that's not the
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
way it will work
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
is there any fear that the private
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
resident would be in some terms forced
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
and what would be the cost comparison
 
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.630 align:start position:0%
and what would be the cost comparison
between

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
they're paying into this utility and
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're paying to maintain their own
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
system possibly replacing it so thank
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
you for the question and i think that
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is really why i think the committee
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
would benefit from hearing from some
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
additional expertise
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
of how utilities work and how they would
 
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
be costed out and how they would be
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
looking at that
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
because i think that there are ways to
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
address that in in in hb 256
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
77 did i get
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
lost it out of my head for a second um
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
that i think that there may be ways and
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
i think senator waters probably has
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
great ideas on how to do that already uh
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure he does um but
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
i think that this is why maybe a
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee might want to look at this
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
is it's really i think that's the the
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
crux of people need to understand
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
what would be the implications and and
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
how would the individual homeowner know
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
what those implications are
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think that we heard that as a valid
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
concern as this went through the the
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
testimony process earlier this session
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
and i think it's something that we could
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
probably benefit from some additional
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
expertise coming in and chatting with
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
you about okay
 
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.430 align:start position:0%
you about okay
follow-up

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.870 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i think um
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
even though it's done
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
little micro community by micro
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
community and the people in say that
 
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.470 align:start position:0%
community and the people in say that
subdivision

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
would hopefully unanimously decide that
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
they want to do it
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
nevertheless it's a municipality the
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
city council
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
that needs to enact the legislation that
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
we're offering them
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
in order to the for those little micro
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
communities to do this
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
and to access all of the state money
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
in order to do that have i got that
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
right yeah they would have it would have
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the course of a city it would
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
certainly have to go through their city
 
00:40:57.839 --> 00:40:58.790 align:start position:0%
certainly have to go through their city
council

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
um you can't just you know start doing
 
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.670 align:start position:0%
um you can't just you know start doing
stuff

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
without that kind of because it would
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
have money involved it would have
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
expenditure involved so all of that
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
would have to go through you know the
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
public process through their city
 
00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.069 align:start position:0%
public process through their city
council

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
a wee follow-up so would that be that
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
project by project would have to be
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
approved by the city council or the city
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
council would just say
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
now we're unable to do this and anywhere
 
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
now we're unable to do this and anywhere
that

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
at any of these little subcommittees
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
want to do it you now have the ability
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know the answer to that i
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
think it would totally depend on how you
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
set up the utility right this was this
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
is why i think you know each one of
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
these is going to be different and it's
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to be different just the way that
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
every you know utility in the state is
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
slightly different um they do slightly
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
different things in different ways they
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
have different fee schedules they you
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
know they do a lot of and it's because
 
00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:50.710 align:start position:0%
know they do a lot of and it's because
of

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
the particulars of that situation so i i
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
think that you know and again i think it
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
would be good to bring in some city
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
officials to ask them that question you
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
know what would have to happen in order
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
for this to move forward if it were if
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
if authorizing legislation were passed
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know how would you go about doing
 
00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:10.309 align:start position:0%
you know how would you go about doing
this

00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you again
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
um mr dears um when i'm looking at i'm
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
talking about now house bill 426
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i think you know i can't imagine
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's anyone who
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to prevent the flow of
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
nitrogen or the results of a failed
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
septic system into any of our lakes or
 
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.230 align:start position:0%
septic system into any of our lakes or
rivers

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
rivers
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
but if i'm looking at the statute as it
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
stands now
 
00:42:42.319 --> 00:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
stands now
um

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
it says if a septic and this is has to
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
do with the uh assessment study the site
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
assessment study right i mean someone
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
gave me this handout i don't know if it
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
was you or if representative spang
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
um if
 
00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.670 align:start position:0%
um if
in

00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
section roman 8 if the septic
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
disposed system designer during the
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
course of the site assessment discovers
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
evidence that there is sewage discharge
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the ground surface or directly into
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
surface waters the designer shall notify
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
in writing the department and the health
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
officer and shall include information in
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
the site assessment report
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
and then in the letter that des sent us
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
in testimony last year
 
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.349 align:start position:0%
in testimony last year
it

00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
it suggested changing this to if the
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
septic system is in failure
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i wondered what the definition of
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
failure is and if that needs to be
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
tweaked i'm trying to figure out how we
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
can get to yes on this bill
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
not necessarily this bill but the
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
concept to better protect the water from
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
failed septic systems
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah this is uh thank you for the
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
question and um i unfortunately i'm i'm
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
getting up to speed on septic
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
rules and such um in my new position
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
but but rob tardif who was our expert
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
retired at the end of may so so but i
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
will i certainly have looked at this a
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
little bit and i will speak to it as
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
been a controversy in the whole way in
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
which septic systems have been
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.670 align:start position:0%
looked at
between

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
and these are these these are not just
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
semantics between the word
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
um evaluation
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
and about evaluation and assessment so
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
those are two really different things
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
and who does the evaluation or the
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
assessment is also important because
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
there are different levels of
 
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.630 align:start position:0%
there are different levels of
qualification

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
qualification
 
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.589 align:start position:0%
qualification
so

00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
for example and uh there are people who
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
can simply do the wet sneaker test
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we call the wet sneaker test
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
if you go out and you're sloshing around
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
on top of the septic system
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's in failure right i mean that's
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's clearly not working correctly
 
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.109 align:start position:0%
that's clearly not working correctly
right

00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
the pure definition of failure
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
in our in our statutes
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
is that it does not meet the
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
requirements of separation between the
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
system and the groundwater table
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
so purely speaking that's the definition
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
of a failure and it's very easy to
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
figure that out
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
you have you you auger a hole you find
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
out how deep the water table is
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know how deep the septic system is
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
because you had a design
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
and you can compare the two
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
so it's very simple to do that but it's
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
not the wet sneaker test and so this is
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
really the crux of this whole
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
the whole that part of the bill
 
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
is really about
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
what is that what is it that will
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
protect buyers and sellers right
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know what is it that protects the
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
the seller from someone coming back at
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
them saying you sold me a failed system
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
or the the buyer from buying something
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i just bought i just bought a pig
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
and a pope
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
right so so
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's the crux of this bill and i think
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
that this bill can be improved
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
and i think we heard testimony from
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
various different people that suggested
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
that there may be ways of improving it
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
um you know and i think from the the
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
septic system
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
commission that was
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
last year was just last year okay i was
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
thinking of other commissions um
 
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
thinking of other commissions um
that

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair has chaired
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know there there are a number of
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
different recommendations within this
 
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
and these were a couple of the common
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
sense ones and so i think that you know
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
things that could be addressed um to to
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
better to improve this bill if the
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee so desired
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
and i think we've thought about this and
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
i mentioned this just in my little
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
tidbits here i think we have some
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts at des again about you know
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
let's let's focus this on the things
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you this is you've been
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh remember this is going to a
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee committee
 
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.030 align:start position:0%
subcommittee committee
right

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
but the committee the committee is going
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
to be voting on whether to send it to
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or not right no
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's my job oh that's your job well
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'll just turn this off
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
just to follow up um for everybody's
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh edification
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
himself got kind of tangled up for a
 
00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.150 align:start position:0%
himself got kind of tangled up for a
while

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like it's possible for a
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
property to pass the assessment
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
because the assessment is just somebody
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
looking at a map
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
and looking at the wetlands and saying
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
yeah this
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
this site is capable of holding a septic
 
00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.150 align:start position:0%
this site is capable of holding a septic
system

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
of with the number of bedrooms that are
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
being proposed
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say anything about
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
whether the septic system is that's in
 
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.870 align:start position:0%
whether the septic system is that's in
there

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
is functioning properly so it'd be
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
possible to get a good assessment
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
and have
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
a failing system
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
bro if you did an evaluation of the
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
system itself yeah this is where i think
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
that the committee would uh would would
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
benefit from some additional testimony
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
hearing from people who actually do this
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
for a living and understanding the the
 
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.790 align:start position:0%
for a living and understanding the the
nuances

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
nuances
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
again these are sort of magical things
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
that sit in our backyards um and so
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
understanding a little bit more about
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
how do we really understand the the
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
health of those and that they're doing
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
the right thing and that that a buyer is
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
buying what they think they are and a
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
seller is selling what they think they
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
are you know this this is uh it's an
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
important aspect and so i again i think
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
that that's why you know hearing some
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
additional testimony from folks
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
who who are out there um
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
you know digging you know digging in the
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
dirt uh would be helpful great thank you
 
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.549 align:start position:0%
dirt uh would be helpful great thank you
uh

00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
i know there's a lot more questions i
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
know i have a lot more questions but
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'll save those for the
 
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.750 align:start position:0%
i'll save those for the
subcommittee

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.790 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
uh

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
but is there any other
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
issues any anything else that
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
is of concern relative to this so do you
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
have additional comments you want to
 
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:33.750 align:start position:0%
have additional comments you want to
make

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
you've given us a lot to think about
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
i i think i've done quite enough
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
speaking to you today unless you need
 
00:49:40.559 --> 00:49:43.990 align:start position:0%
speaking to you today unless you need
more

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes we do we i will i will uh i'll be
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
here all day oh okay uh well we'll we'll
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh toward the end i was gonna uh
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
try to take up not all of them just get
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
a an overall view of the
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the pfas bills maybe we now that
 
00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.990 align:start position:0%
of the pfas bills maybe we now that
you're

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
yeah you're here
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
know i would uh i don't want to see you
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
go and i have to come back i'm i'm happy
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
to take a walk and come back at any
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
moment mr chair
 
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:20.870 align:start position:0%
moment mr chair
but

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
whatever it would
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
when we want to just go fast through the
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
pfas bills
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
we'll then uh
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
all right we
 
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.910 align:start position:0%
all right we
what

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
we have the uh
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
do you have you gotten
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
well do you have a copy uh
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
of all of the people of the pfast builds
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir i do okay uh by the way anybody
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
everybody have their copy of this uh
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
yeah if you do you want it i made it i
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
made some additional copies this these
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
are all of the the hell the builds that
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
we are retaining
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
yeah it's
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
by our committee uh
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
committee researcher and she did a
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
fantastic job
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's better than having the bills
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
believe me in front of you
 
00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.510 align:start position:0%
believe me in front of you
uh

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.309 align:start position:0%
uh
just

00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh just to try uh do you have a copy of
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
oh i have this online
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right we're just uh just going
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
down the
 
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
going down the just going down the list
 
00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.990 align:start position:0%
going down the just going down the list
1167

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
1167
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
the establishing a maximum containment
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
level for perfluorinated chemicals in
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
basically we're monitoring
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
let's see committee recommended interim
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
study to allow us to evaluate these bill
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
together with the new des standards and
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
return the body necessary legislation
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
to protect new hampshire's pristine
 
00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:22.069 align:start position:0%
to protect new hampshire's pristine
waters

00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.079 --> 00:52:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
this is awareness of dangers uh
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
establishing a maximum contaminant level
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
for perfluorinated chemicals
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
in surface water
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
we're

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
we're basically uh
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
just monitoring it
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
and with uh
 
00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:46.790 align:start position:0%
and with uh
uh

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
to see how uh
 
00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.710 align:start position:0%
to see how uh
it

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
how des is doing
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
relative to that to this build the
 
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.990 align:start position:0%
relative to that to this build the
contaminants

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.069 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
you underst you you have that in front
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.349 align:start position:0%
of you
okay

00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh yes sir any comment on this
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
des was opposed to this bill for a
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons and really this comes
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
down to the fact that this is a highly
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
changing environment um and as people
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
may have seen last week there was a new
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
notification from epa they're starting
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
to look at some health guidance and what
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
we heard from that the important take
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
home from that is that epa is working on
 
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:34.230 align:start position:0%
home from that is that epa is working on
mcl's

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
mcl's
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh that will help to inform the state
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
process so you know i think that this is
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
one of these where
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
by the time we get around to hearing
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
what epa comes up with having it go
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
through the public process that they're
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
going to go through because they're
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
going to go through a public you know
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
public comment and all of that vetting
 
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.349 align:start position:0%
public comment and all of that vetting
process

00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to be a year from now really
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
before we hear what epa is really coming
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
up with so this is a bill that that i
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
think would be
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know i think in september of 2023
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
that may be ripe again for some new
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
legislation but at this point you know
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
we've developed some of the most highly
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
protective uh policies in the in the
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
nation we're so far ahead of most of the
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
nation on this issue
 
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we feel like this is the the time
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
right now is to you know let the science
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
catch up and let the policy catch up
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
from the federal level to where we've
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
been because we've been so far out in
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
front and we'll have much better
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any uh other questions
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
that of post
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um i just
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to know what an mcl is so an mcl
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
is a maximum contaminant limit and it's
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
simply a number that if you get above
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
not good for people to drink
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
so you know the maximum contaminant
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
levels that have been established for
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
some of the pfas chemicals so for you
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
know p p p phoa and p foss you know we
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
developed those they're in the parts per
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
trillion range
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
um you know we have lots of other mcl's
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
about lots of other things from
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
nucleotides to you know halogens to all
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of different uh these mcl's for
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
14 house bill 1440
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
relative to surface water quality
 
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:34.789 align:start position:0%
relative to surface water quality
standards

00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
go right ahead
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
your comments i testified on this bill
 
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.109 align:start position:0%
your comments i testified on this bill
uh

00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
back in looks like february uh we
 
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
addressed this one actually no was
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
january 25th
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we uh had that hearing
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh here in front of you and uh at that
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
point the department was opposed to the
 
00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
point the department was opposed to the
bill

00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
um interestingly since then
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
epa has now come out with some
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
additional draft
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
criteria that would apply for aquatic
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
life so you know one of the things that
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
we said when we developed our plan uh we
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
as you recall there was a bill that
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
required us to develop a plan by january
 
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
of 2020 to look at how we were going to
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
be regulating pfas compounds in surface
 
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.109 align:start position:0%
be regulating pfas compounds in surface
waters

00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
waters
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
as part of that plan one of the things
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we identified was a huge expense at
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
developing our own criteria because of
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
the amount of ex basically new science
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
that had to be developed epa is finally
 
00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
developing that science there are some
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
draft numbers on the street
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
that will be out probably in a year or
 
00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.549 align:start position:0%
that will be out probably in a year or
so

00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
in the meantime we are well on our way
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
to developing rules for uh water quality
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
standards that will go into effect
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully by next january we're about to
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
publish a draft of those rules
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
which will take the mcls
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the representative post asked about
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
it will put those into our surface water
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
standards where they apply for drinking
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
water sources
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
so the way that we apply that is
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
upstream 20 miles of of a drinking water
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
intake from a surface water so that's
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
that criteria that you're that goes into
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
the groundwater standard today that's
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
what mcl's deal with the groundwater
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
those numbers will be the same numbers
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
for surface waters for surface water
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
sources of drinking water but hopefully
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
by january or so so we're getting very
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
close to entering the formal rule making
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
process on that so this bill is
 
00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.589 align:start position:0%
process on that so this bill is
essentially

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
i i think we're already doing what it's
 
00:57:41.359 --> 00:57:42.150 align:start position:0%
i i think we're already doing what it's
telling

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
telling
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
us to do
 
00:57:43.359 --> 00:57:44.069 align:start position:0%
us to do
and

00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh and and this is such a hot topic that
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to be in front of
 
00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.270 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to be in front of
you

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
for a very long time uh on an annual
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
basis talking about this so i think that
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
that this rule this this law again is
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
overridden by by both action that des
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
has already taken as well as federal
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay future you
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative uh grassy
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes mr cheers would this bill
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
serve a purpose you know if we
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
introduced it in the fall
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
and you're saying it could be january
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
before we find out what we want to do
 
00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
could this bill be a vehicle
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
to amend
 
00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:28.150 align:start position:0%
to amend
in

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
january or february
 
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:30.789 align:start position:0%
january or february
to

00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
allow you to enact some of the stuff
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's coming down from the federal
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
government that you want to put into law
 
00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative i i think that we're a
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
year away from really having all the
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
information that we want when i said
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
january that's going to be when we're
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
going to have rules published so so we
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
were we will already be down the road by
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
then so i don't know that there's
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
anything new that we're going to know
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
between now and the next session that's
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
going to necessary necessitate some
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
smith thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
again mr dears um
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
when you say the rules uh will be
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
published in january is that mean that
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
will be when the public hearings begin
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking the question no we
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
intend to be having public hearings in
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you no i want to have the
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
rules finalized by january i'd like to
 
00:59:25.119 --> 00:59:26.630 align:start position:0%
rules finalized by january i'd like to
okay

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
remember in september we are going we
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
will be the time we will be
 
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.309 align:start position:0%
will be the time we will be
actually

00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
disposing of the you know interim study
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
on these bills so september and october
 
00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.150 align:start position:0%
on these bills so september and october
so

00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
this is just a cat this is just a
 
00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:48.470 align:start position:0%
this is just a cat this is just a
checkup

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
renaming the department of environmental
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
services the department of environmental
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
protection don't even bother to
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
don't don't even comment on that and
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
assigning the department oversight to
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
private drinking water wells
 
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.230 align:start position:0%
private drinking water wells
uh

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think it goes without saying that this
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
was something that um
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
that the department was not uh in favor
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
of uh particularly yeah certainly the
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
renaming would be extraordinarily
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
expensive yeah um and unclear as to what
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
the benefit would be um and also just
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
from a i will tell you living inside of
 
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.510 align:start position:0%
from a i will tell you living inside of
des

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
des
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
the services piece is really important
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
to us uh we take that very seriously at
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
des we intend to provide excellent
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
customer service and if we're not we
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
like to hear about it because we we
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
really do have that as part of our ethos
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
and in in terms of the the drinking
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
water piece um
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
we believe that we already have the
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
authority to do what you suggested oh
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
and look who's behind me thank goodness
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
saved by the bell
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
mark sam lauren assistant commissioner
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire des
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
the commissioner asked me to come down
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill in particular
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh we testified
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
um before
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
we have uh we would be very
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
um strongly opposed to renaming the
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
department both for the
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
increase in cost and the
 
01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:17.030 align:start position:0%
increase in cost and the
um

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
as ted was about starting to explain and
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
he's been in the department a lot longer
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
than i have um we really do think that
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
much more represents
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
the culture and
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
the approach we like to take in terms of
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
being customer service i'm not
 
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.789 align:start position:0%
being customer service i'm not
the

01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
seem to be more draconian um the the
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
other name and what's associated with
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
the protection you know where we're here
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
to provide services to the public and
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
help them accomplish their goals and
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
their projects while obviously keeping
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
our resources safe
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
so the commissioner asked me to come
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
down and make sure
 
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.589 align:start position:0%
down and make sure
we

01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
supported ted in delivering that message
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
of course all right of course uh thank
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
you mr chair um and thank you
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner it's the first
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
time i've met you
 
01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:14.309 align:start position:0%
time i've met you
um

01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
i have uh
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
well there's two parts of this the first
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
one is i know that that there's been a
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
lot of concern for a long time that
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
every other
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
environmental agency in new england has
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
the word protection in it
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
that they don't see them their
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
their duty as to facilitate
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
development etc but i respect what
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
you're saying and i can certainly see
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
the logic of that
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
i'd like to address the second part of
 
01:02:45.359 --> 01:02:46.390 align:start position:0%
i'd like to address the second part of
it

01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
i got very involved with some of you
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
guys over there at des
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
with the problem of arsenic
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
in drinking water
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to get people in my
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
community to be testing and send those
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
test results into des
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
i believe the arsenic is
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
overlooked and very large problem
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
if des doesn't do it who will who will
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
make sure that we begin to address the
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
problem of arsenic and private drinking
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
water wells
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
so i'll i'll speak but this is also one
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
i'll ted add in anything um
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know we actually feel
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
um we already have the ability to
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
request permission to access folks
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
private property there's a process
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
when we testified the first time when
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
this bill was up um we talked to our
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
staff and staff has
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know access has never been a a
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of determining uh
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
testing wells and so um and there's a
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
process in place that has always worked
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
for us so
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
um it's not that we don't
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
agree in terms of the intent we just
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
think this goes beyond what's needed and
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
our current process and what's in uh
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
statute um it works for us and um the
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
few times there are problems you know we
 
01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
can work with the town and figure out
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know hacks but uh staff has said
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
very comfortable in terms of our
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
existing process and our ability to you
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
know as you know for the pvas we've done
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
more testing on private than you know
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise in almost any um
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
state in the country and we've been able
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
to do that very successfully working
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
with the homeowners and our existing
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
authorization ted junior you want to add
 
01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:48.470 align:start position:0%
authorization ted junior you want to add
well

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
to that issue i think certainly you you
 
01:04:52.789 --> 01:04:52.799 align:start position:0%
covered in terms of arsenic certainly
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
that's an issue and one of the things
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
that des did
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh two years ago
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
we uh launched a program that would get
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
point of
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
point of use treatment
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
for arsenic two people who have wells
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
for anyone who was either expecting a
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
child or or wanted to be expecting a
 
01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:16.230 align:start position:0%
child or or wanted to be expecting a
child

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
and those are the most vulnerable
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
populations for arsenic
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
the wastewater treatment plant or the
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
water treatment plants the the community
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
systems around the state uh recently you
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
know the mcl was recently lowered for
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
arsenic so so people are starting to
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's happening that that's getting
 
01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.789 align:start position:0%
that's happening that that's getting
treated

01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
treated
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
wells and individual wells is certainly
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
a concern and it's one that the des
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
continues to have i don't think this
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
this this this particular bill
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
was the vehicle to deal with that uh but
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
they're certainly um you know
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
we have been encouraging people to get
 
01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
their wells tested for arsenic we
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
encourage people to get their wells
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
tested for lots of things
 
01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.230 align:start position:0%
tested for lots of things
um

01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
and making i think this point of
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
treatment point of use treatment
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
available especially for vulnerable
 
01:06:04.559 --> 01:06:06.069 align:start position:0%
available especially for vulnerable
populations

01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
populations
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
i i think is going to be the the
 
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
approach that is
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
that is is prudent at this point
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
you can't make someone test their well
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
because this is really about your
 
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.710 align:start position:0%
because this is really about your
personal

01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
your personal health
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's what you're drinking out of your
 
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.349 align:start position:0%
it's what you're drinking out of your
faucet

01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
faucet
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
and so you know it's different when it's
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
a community system because you don't get
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
to control what's in that but when
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
you're in your own home
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
you know you you do and so i think that
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
this is one of those touchy places in
 
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.069 align:start position:0%
this is one of those touchy places in
which

01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
we would like to be helpful and if
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
there's thoughts around you know the
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
state on how we can be more helpful
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
especially to vulnerable populations
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
you know i think that that's something
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
that we would love to talk with people
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
about but at this point i don't know
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
that there's a legislative remedy for
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
you know for this issue of individual
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
well owners um and their desire to get
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
their water tested this bill wouldn't be
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill is really about
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
entering someone's house if there's
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
some other issue going on and i don't
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
think that was like that's going to
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
happen not
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
not and not in this state or at least
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
does this have a subcommittee no
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
this will not have a subject yeah i this
 
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
this will not have a subject yeah i this
yeah

01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's two different issues i think
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to follow up with you about
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
this the specific issue you're talking
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
about um i i don't think this bill would
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
um achieve your ultimate goal that
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
you're looking to achieve we
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
we have the ability right now to work
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
with homeowners and and test their wells
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
and if it's part of a larger testing and
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
um or if something's going on locally
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that process has always worked and
 
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.309 align:start position:0%
and that process has always worked and
we've

01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know our staff assured us we've
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
never had a problem um working with the
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
homeowner to to test and um we we don't
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
feel um this would uh benefit the
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
process in any way
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay maybe we can talk later
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
all right uh moving right along
 
01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
all right uh moving right along
uh

01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
we'll uh
 
01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
us house bill 1602 relative to
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
perfluoronated chemicals and drinking
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
water uh that was uh
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh that had to do with uh
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative grassy's uh
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
a similar bill we had uh
 
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.910 align:start position:0%
a similar bill we had uh
someone

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
came in and did speak to us about that
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
when was that uh
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
right a little bit a little because a
 
01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:38.750 align:start position:0%
month or two ago
 
01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:48.070 align:start position:0%
month or two ago
[Music]

01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:55.349 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:08:55.349 --> 01:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:56.870 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
yeah and as there's there's no one here
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
to testify i don't think on that that i
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
think we're up to date on that then this
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh well i said he would be back
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh later on with additional information
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken right but i think
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's information we may be getting
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
during the summer yep but
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
the thing is as well as this bill was
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
similar to the lead bill which we passed
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
yes as far as uh monitoring and
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
reporting out a number of things that
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
are in 1421 i think it was uh and uh
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
which is on the governor's desk
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
and uh so you know it may be something
 
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
that we want to take a look at as part
 
01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.749 align:start position:0%
that we want to take a look at as part
of

01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
you know i would say if you if you're
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
planning on putting some of these um
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
these pfas bills together in a committee
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
that we just sort of slip this one in
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
there and and have it sitting there
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
whether we do anything with it or not
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
it uh i think would something that the
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
committee would at least be able to take
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
testimony from the state if they had any
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
if des have has any further stuff that
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh house bill the last one i think uh on
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
pfast is
 
01:10:06.159 --> 01:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
pfast is
1618

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
1618
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh adding several perfluorinated
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals to the list
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
of per and
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
polyfluorinated floral alkyl substance
 
01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.270 align:start position:0%
polyfluorinated floral alkyl substance
substances

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
substances
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
with maximum contaminant level and
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
establishes cumulative total et cetera
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.750 align:start position:0%
et cetera
[Music]

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
you have a comment on that uh
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you this was uh a bill that again
 
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
we it's very similar to 1167
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we had some of the similar testimony
 
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
on that the des was opposed to that for
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
a number of reasons
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
mostly because
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
the the actual numbers that were being
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
proposed we do not think were supported
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
yet in the science
 
01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
and so the challenge that we had there
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
was really that the scientific evidence
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
relative to pfba and pfbs
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
would essentially um
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
were not supported yet by the scientific
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
research that we had seen we also had
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about combining different kinds
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
of pfas into a combined number and the
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that they have
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
different effects different chemicals
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
have different effects on the human body
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
and so we didn't feel that we have not
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
felt and we have we've testified on this
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
any number of times that we do not feel
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
at this point given what we know today
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
to come to combine them into a combined
 
01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.229 align:start position:0%
to come to combine them into a combined
number

01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh and so this is this is again part of
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
the the sort of nuances of of pfas and
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
how they're being regulated around the
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
country but in our estimation this is
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
not yet an appropriate way to develop
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
these kinds of numbers uh in a combined
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
manner so those were the tests that's
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
testimony we gave um again we're gonna
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
see epa come out with a whole raft of
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
new science stuff that's coming out of
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
an academy of science and we'll know a
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
lot more about what this what some of
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
these chemicals are and what they're
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
doing um or at least what we know about
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
them uh over the next uh you know six to
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
nine months we'll have a much better
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
understanding at least of the newest
 
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.750 align:start position:0%
understanding at least of the newest
science

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
of the pass builds
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh you have a
 
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.510 align:start position:0%
uh you have a
question

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
question
uh

01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
is there any more uh any
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
i don't wanna
 
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
we are going to be this uh there are not
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's i will not be uh calling uh
 
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.270 align:start position:0%
there's i will not be uh calling uh
any

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
any
uh

01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
convening a
 
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:01.430 align:start position:0%
convening a
uh

01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
work session
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
on the these any of these pfas fills
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
they will go
 
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
they will be taken up at the executive
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
sessions that we will have
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
in uh september and october so
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not not forming any
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
let's get uh let's
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
house bill
1498

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
1498
 
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:50.470 align:start position:0%
1498
establishing

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
yes you're excused i don't think there's
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
anything much more we can ask
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
the the ted talk has ended
 
01:13:56.719 --> 01:13:57.669 align:start position:0%
the the ted talk has ended
um

01:13:57.669 --> 01:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
being here today yeah thank you all i
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
so much
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
257 all right for sure
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
man remember this will be before us a
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh senator david waters district uh four
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
and um just a couple quick words on on
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
257 i really appreciate ted deer's
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
thorough explanation of what's happening
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
with the great bay
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
and really the extraordinary nature of
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
the agreement with the epa because they
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
are ready with a sledgehammer to come
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
down and cost us hundreds of millions of
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
dollars more
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
if we don't get the deal with the
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
nitrogen i wanted to pass around
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
the bill as introduced
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
and just point this out as some options
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced you'll see on
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
lines eight to ten
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
just applied to the
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
great bay communities those folks who
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
are under the ms4 mandate
 
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
so that was the original
 
01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.669 align:start position:0%
so that was the original
bill

01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
um senator guida who's particularly
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
interested in the lakes
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
and his you know legislation about
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
algebras and other things
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
suggested two things one was that
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
it'd be expanded to potentially include
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
other areas beyond
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
the great bay
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then secondly
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see in the amended bill
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
senator geider particularly thought we
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
ought to have cost estimates so that
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
town councils and city councils
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
would in town meetings would have a
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
thorough understanding
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
of if they set up a district what kinds
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
of expenses might be involved for the
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers makes a lot of sense
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
it might be easiest for the committee in
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee to think about
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
separating out whether we just do the
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
great bay communities now because we are
 
01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
under this epa mandate
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
and there are communities who are
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
forming stormwater utilities
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
and this would be useful to them to save
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
money for taxpayers right now
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
and that perhaps the issue of the lakes
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
is one that could be addressed in uh
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
in other legislation so that's all i
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to suggest mr chairman and thank
 
01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.229 align:start position:0%
wanted to suggest mr chairman and thank
you

01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be moving right along well let's
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
look let's go down the list uh
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%

uh

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative egan this uh this is your
 
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.870 align:start position:0%
representative egan this uh this is your
bill

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh could you bring us up to date on it
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh and just uh
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh where you think where where uh if you
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
think you might wanna go
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're talking we're consideration
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
folding it in uh bringing it before
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.189 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh level house bill was at 1188
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
committee commission but uh
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen it approved yet uh signed
 
01:17:39.679 --> 01:17:41.910 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen it approved yet uh signed
uh

01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
do you where do you think where do you
 
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
think this ought to be thank you mr
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
chair yeah i am inclined to ask for the
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
commission if so then
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
created into law to take up this uh in
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
speaking with fish in game and the
 
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department and
 
01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:58.870 align:start position:0%
insurance department and
other

01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
trade associations involved in the bill
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
that would be the wisest place for it to
 
01:18:03.199 --> 01:18:04.870 align:start position:0%
that would be the wisest place for it to
be

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
moved forward and
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of them have agreed that it would
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
actually be a top priority of that
 
01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
actually be a top priority of that
commission

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
um so i think we'd be able to take a
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
good look at
 
01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.590 align:start position:0%
good look at
um

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
as well the differences between the two
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
industries that are impacted ohrv versus
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles um so
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
while this bill was well intentioned
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think the commission would be able to
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
separate it out see what parts overlap
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
that are worthwhile that apply to both
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
ridership as well as be able to figure
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
out what are specific needed for for the
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
distinct ridership of each or uh
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
community i think so
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
my inclination is to do that i guess i
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
was hoping that i would learn today of
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
the commission's status so that would be
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
my one question
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative post yes thank you um um
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this um
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
that addresses the fact that some
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
railways and things are not no longer
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
being indemnified
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
by their insurance companies for
 
01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:34.070 align:start position:0%
by their insurance companies for
ridership

01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
no there's not that is that was an
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
important part that i think i wanted to
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
have as a discussion i did have a couple
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh initial discussions courtesy of the
 
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:43.669 align:start position:0%
uh initial discussions courtesy of the
um

01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
the direct the director with the deputy
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner regarding um then
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
they were going to check back with
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
the lead agency on behalf of the state
 
01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.590 align:start position:0%
the lead agency on behalf of the state
regarding

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
um two matters indemnification and um
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
as well as could
 
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:03.270 align:start position:0%
as well as could
ridership

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
ridership
 
01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.790 align:start position:0%
ridership
that

01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
took the
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
safety exam and did see a fee could they
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
get a
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
discount on their insurance because they
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
took a safety test and therefore the fee
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
would become less complicated they'd
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually get a discount
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
you know and the fee would become moot
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
so that was one conversation and the
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
other one was about
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
where does
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
liability come into play based on
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know class six roads easements all
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
i think and and i'll defer to the
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
captain because he may he definitely
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
knows more than i do um
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
that there's still a gray area about and
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
i think if not a gray area that there is
 
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.310 align:start position:0%
i think if not a gray area that there is
confusion

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.189 align:start position:0%
confusion
with

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
landowners homeowners writers where and
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
where where i can't go and who's liable
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that would be an important
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
part of the commission is as well a
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
if not a law but also some communication
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives that i know both trade
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
associations um
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
for each respective ridership or hrv
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
snowmobile would be interested in making
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.719 --> 01:21:13.669 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
where they can ride safely and it might
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
help them with some of the issues that
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
we do see where riders are going off the
 
01:21:20.239 --> 01:21:21.270 align:start position:0%
we do see where riders are going off the
trailer

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
trailer
 
01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.470 align:start position:0%
trailer
uh

01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
awry in easements so those two
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
issues were brought up in those
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
discussions with the
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
um like i said with direct with the
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
director from fish and game and the
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you and
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative egan you had asked what
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
was the status of 1188 it has not yet
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
been signed into law
 
01:21:48.719 --> 01:21:50.070 align:start position:0%
been signed into law
okay

01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
i will
 
01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.470 align:start position:0%
i will
still

01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
feel confident that it will and that
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
this bill should be an integral part of
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need i think really
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
what we the decision that has to be made
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
is do we need a subcommittee for this
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we do i don't think we
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
do and i'll just
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
i'll just look at the captain if is
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
there anything that i
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
reflect or reflect inaccurately
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and so we're really the decision is
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
no no subcommittee
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
one of the um issues that was brought up
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
in a uh conversation earlier is that the
 
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.270 align:start position:0%
in a uh conversation earlier is that the
bill

01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
puts lumps ohrvs and snowmobiles in the
 
01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.350 align:start position:0%
puts lumps ohrvs and snowmobiles in the
same

01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
category so in the interim study report
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
we probably should indicate that that's
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
something that should be separated out
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
we separated out snowmobile and ohrv
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
statutes a few years ago in legislation
 
01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.669 align:start position:0%
statutes a few years ago in legislation
so

01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
this part should be in that category
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
also exactly and that's why i think the
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
commission will be able to look at the
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
overlap between the two industries and
 
01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:08.390 align:start position:0%
overlap between the two industries and
the

01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
and where there stands to be
 
01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.149 align:start position:0%
and where there stands to be
separate

01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
policy for them based on
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.830 align:start position:0%
you know
seasonality

01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
seasonality
 
01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:18.790 align:start position:0%
seasonality
um

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
the type of machine you know
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
you can't apply one law to everything
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
something i learned very well in in
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
crafting this
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
or attempting to craft this piece of
 
01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.990 align:start position:0%
or attempting to craft this piece of
legislation

01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
you mr chair uh if i could ask captain
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
eastman a question
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'm on equestrian and we received a
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
request from uh new hampshire i think
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
horse council that on the training for
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
education of the riders
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
that it include etiquette about what to
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
do when you
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
come across a horse and a horseman on
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
the trail
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you already do that so
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
could you comment do you already have
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
etiquette in your training for what
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
these snowmobiles and off track vehicles
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
should do if they approach a horse
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
i've just recently reviewed our online
 
01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.790 align:start position:0%
i've just recently reviewed our online
uh

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
course as far as and there is certainly
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
an etiquette portion in there um the
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
whole course
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak specifically it speaks
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
multi-use trails i mean obviously any
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
any trail out there um whether it's
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
snowmobile or ohrv is subject to
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
um you know uh
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
like dog
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
you know certainly horses and and
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
hikers and and um you know dog teams
 
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
sled teams uh you know in the wintertime
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
so there is some of that etiquette um
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
and of course etiquette as far as
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
stewardship for landowners and and you
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
know public lands and things of that
 
01:24:58.239 --> 01:25:01.510 align:start position:0%
know public lands and things of that
nature

01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
um captain eastman might i direct the
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
horse council person to speak to you
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
directly because i asked them if they
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
had any other
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
comments i don't trail ride i show so
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not used to what happens when you
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
but i do see cars uh causing my horse to
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
have a problem if i'm at a show and they
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
backfire or whatever so if i can i'll
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
direct them to talk to you maybe get
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
some details into you that might help
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
the training
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
most certainly it will take any anything
 
01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1620 uh which is identifying
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
part of the merrimack river as a
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
protected river there's no is there
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
anyone here to speak to that
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
if not we'll just
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
if not we'll just go on it's uh
 
01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
if not we'll just go on it's uh
oh

01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
you can it's i mean it's just we we just
 
01:26:11.189 --> 01:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
held it there in case somebody
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh comes in and says
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
we got a lot of stuff here that we can
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
you know that we're
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go or that kind of thing
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for uh
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
inviting me back up um i i think that uh
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
we have heard that certainly uh folks
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
are interested uh at some point uh of
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
talking about bringing in the the uh
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
this middle section the missing section
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
the gap
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh of the uh of the merrimack into the
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
rakes lakes i almost said it rakes and
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
livers uh the lakes and rivers programs
 
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.189 align:start position:0%
livers uh the lakes and rivers programs
um

01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
but again i think that what we heard in
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and what we've heard i think
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
from the local folks is that they're
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
interested in going through the process
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
as it's currently set up in statute
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh and so you know i think that if if
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
this committee were to take up some
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
portion of this bill it would be the
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
other part of the bill
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
which which we recommended that if you
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
were going to do something with this
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
is that the addition of the
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
of that middle section should happen
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
through current statute but there was
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
this little piece that sits in law
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
that's been in there for 30 years
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
relative to penichak water works and
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
the you know the ability to withdraw
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
water at certain amounts
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
des we are concerned
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
that given the situation
 
01:27:36.470 --> 01:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
as we all know about pfas in the
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
and the new investments that the
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
communities are making
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
in the southern new hampshire water
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
connection systems and i think you're
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
all well aware of of the new systems
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that are going in through salem uh down
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
in windham uh that are coming you know
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
bringing water in
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
that there may be a need
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
to address that particular piece now
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not that should be a
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
standalone piece of legislation that
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
could be introduced in september and
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
take it up next year or if that's
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
something that you want to talk about
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
next next fall you know that that really
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
truly is up to up to the chair and and
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
but it's something that probably ought
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
to get addressed at some point
 
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not critical today it's
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
not critical this year
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
but certainly future planning um this is
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
an issue that that that probably should
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
be addressed
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
and i have tracy sales who's our
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers uh manager and um if
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
any uh any questions on that
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
again i will i don't think we're gonna
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee on this
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe but it would be
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
discussed obviously at our uh
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
when we exact this
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you and um
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%

01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh telling them about this bill and
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
asking for their responses and i
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
wondered if you knew what had come out
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
of that if anything
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh we we have
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
not received to my knowledge we have not
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
received a formal response in any manner
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
from either any of the three communities
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
who received that letter so
 
01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.390 align:start position:0%
who received that letter so
anecdotally

01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
anecdotally
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
um uh assistant commissioner sanborn did
 
01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.310 align:start position:0%
um uh assistant commissioner sanborn did
hear

01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know that there was some discussion
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
going on and that people were you know
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
it sounded like the boards were nobody
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
was you know ruffled that much about it
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
but i think that we had really wanted
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
something a little bit more than that
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
um and and we did not get that
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
is it captain emeritus or captain
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
or did they give you a promotion on the
 
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
way out like
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
are you are you know you're now a
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
colonel major
 
01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.300 align:start position:0%
colonel major
retired

01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:37.310 align:start position:0%
retired
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:46.830 align:start position:0%
retired
[Laughter]

01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
well i think it's just allowing
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
everybody to back to
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
what this is what you hear about is uh
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
we uh in the discussion originally on
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh it was we found that
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
you were
 
01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:05.830 align:start position:0%
you were
the

01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:06.790 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:09.669 --> 01:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
coast guard was concerned with the fees
 
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and we thought maybe this is a
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
good bill maybe use it as a vehicle to
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
see what we can't move the ball along
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair that is a a an
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
accurate summary of of what we came
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
before you with
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh at the time of
 
01:31:28.629 --> 01:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
representative trottie's bill to look at
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
registration fees
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
i've given you a one-page handout
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
as sort of an educational tool it
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
references some attachments but i'm not
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
going to burden you with the attachments
 
01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.990 align:start position:0%
going to burden you with the attachments
today

01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're just essentially copies of
 
01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.790 align:start position:0%
they're just essentially copies of
statute

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
our concern after a coast guard desk
 
01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.709 align:start position:0%
our concern after a coast guard desk
audit

01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
which happens every couple of years
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
as a result of new hampshire or the
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
marine patrol specifically receiving
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
federal monies to help with recreational
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
boating safety it's called the
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
recreational boating safety grant but
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's not anything we apply for it's
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
simply new hampshire's share that is
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
shared with
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
56 states and territories uh in our
 
01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.070 align:start position:0%
56 states and territories uh in our
country

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:14.870 align:start position:0%
country
with

01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
fish and wildlife agencies and agencies
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for recreational boating
 
01:32:18.639 --> 01:32:19.750 align:start position:0%
responsible for recreational boating
safety

01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
um the feds disperse that money uh that
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
comes from uh taxes assessed on fishing
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
gear hunting gear
 
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
we have to be compliant however with
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
certain things in order to be eligible
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
for those funds
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the items that we need to be
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
compliant with is the federal bound
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
numbering system the federal
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
registration system for recreational
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
votes and as i pointed out to you as a
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
result of that audit it was determined
 
01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:55.910 align:start position:0%
result of that audit it was determined
that

01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
the state was in violation of
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
federal code
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
when we collected fees unrelated to the
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
boat registration itself
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
and you'll see in my handout
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
categories of what a person pays when
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
they register their boat in our state
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
the top paragraph in 270e is a flat rate
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
fee depending upon the length of your
 
01:33:19.199 --> 01:33:20.229 align:start position:0%
fee depending upon the length of your
boat

01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
boat
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
and by statute
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
those revenues come to the marine patrol
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
in the middle page and i put a red flag
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
next to it
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
is a series of additional fees that are
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
collected at the time of the boat
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
registration that go to outside agencies
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's what is in violation of
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
federal code
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
um that that we are hoping we can come
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
before you and and and receive some
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislative relief
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
on on
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
the collection of those fees while at
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
the same time we recognize how important
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
those fees are to the agencies that
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
receive them
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's pretty self-explanatory
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
where they go
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
and when you when you look at those
 
01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.030 align:start position:0%
and when you when you look at those
numbers

01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
times 100 000 votes give or take
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
depending upon the year
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
um those those revenues are important to
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
those agencies
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
then in addition
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
at the bottom are the
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
boat fees
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
that are also in a separate statute
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh that are assessed uh by mill rate
 
01:34:28.149 --> 01:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
depending upon the length of your boat
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
the type of your boat whether it's a
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
cabin cruiser or a sailboat
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
and how many engines it's equipped with
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh the interesting thing is is the
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
history of those mill rates go back so
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
far that they don't even account for the
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
fact that we now have boats that have
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
three four and five outboard engines off
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
the back of them
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
we thought that perhaps it was time to
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
bring this
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
to a head instead of kicking the ball
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
down the field continuously look at some
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
of these issues
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
in the early 90s marine patrol was a
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
general funded agency
 
01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.270 align:start position:0%
general funded agency
and

01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
being seasonal in nature
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
we were scraping the bottom of the
 
01:35:11.109 --> 01:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
barrel every year to provide the
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
services that we had come to be expected
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
by the voting public
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
with the help of the new hampshire
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
marine trades association new hampshire
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
lakes and an overall awareness by the
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislature that that more money needed
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
to go to boating safety in our state
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
they created the navigation safety fund
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
which was a dedicated revolving fund
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
where marine patrol would receive the
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
revenues of voting registrations
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
prior to that the passage of that bill
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
the towns that would register boats
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the marinas within those towns that
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
would register boats
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
that was in the early 90s
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately an unintended consequence
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
of that as we are now in 2022
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
it has created a competition for those
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
funds between the state
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the towns that are registering boats
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
where there has been no increase since
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
that time in these rates
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh that competition is now catching up
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
with us
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and while
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
the towns do great things with those
 
01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.270 align:start position:0%
the towns do great things with those
revenues

01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.629 align:start position:0%
revenues
um

01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's time before it gets too late to
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
look at this overall registration system
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
and you'll see at the bottom of the
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph the statute where it says
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
any money that is collected by the town
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
or a boat agent
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
that being a marina within that town
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
stay with the town
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
i've brought jeff oberdenk here today
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
from the dmv who can speak to where
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
those revenues go and how they how
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
they're split up between the state and
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
and and the overall issue that
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
this system creates with us being able
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
to provide an online renewal service
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
which the public is screaming for uh
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
especially during covert and even the
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
town clerks some want to be involved
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
some don't and i'll let jeff expand on
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
that but we are here today in hopes that
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
that we can move forward uh with some
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
sort of legislative relief
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
primarily to address um
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
the the issue with the uh the federal
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
government uh and the eligibility for
 
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
those funds we are currently out of
 
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:24.229 align:start position:0%
those funds we are currently out of
compliance

01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
and those dollars are in jeopardy
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions before i
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
turn it over to jeff
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you captain
 
01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you captain
dunleavy

01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
dunleavy
 
01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.550 align:start position:0%
dunleavy
um

01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
so at the top of the page we have the
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
registration fees which
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
top off at ninety two
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then at the
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh in section the third little section
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
it says boat fees and then c attachment
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
two for tables
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh and they go up to seventeen hundred
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
sixty one dollars per boat
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't
 
01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:05.109 align:start position:0%
so i don't
so

01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
there are other fees for boats besides
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
the registration
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes it's basically the same thing it's
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
one's a flat rate
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
that you see at the top and the bottom
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
is a mill rate
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's based on the value of your vessel
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
and it it declines over five years
 
01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.149 align:start position:0%
and it it declines over five years
um

01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
so are we using that now we are the
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
issue ma'am is that
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
if i is the bone owner
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
register with the town
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
or in the case of a large marina that
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
may winterize and house
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
four thousand boats they provide a
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
tremendous service to their customers
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
where they actually will summarize the
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
boat get it ready for memorial day and
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
register it for them
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
or i walk into a marina because i need
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
to buy some life jackets and i take
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of the fact that that they
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
also register boats at the marina
 
01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:57.109 align:start position:0%
also register boats at the marina
my

01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
my check for my boat registration
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
and the mill rate portion of my
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.629 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the significant
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
difference in the amounts of the portion
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the fee you pay for a boat
 
01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.709 align:start position:0%
of the fee you pay for a boat
registration

01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh if it's being if that transaction is
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
being conducted
 
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
being conducted
with

01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
an agent other than a dmv substation
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
or marine patrol headquarters those
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
and and for years that wasn't an issue
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
but over time it is caught up
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
because more and more people are looking
 
01:39:35.119 --> 01:39:35.990 align:start position:0%
because more and more people are looking
for

01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.430 align:start position:0%
for
um

01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
that ease if you will of this
 
01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:41.030 align:start position:0%
that ease if you will of this
transaction

01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
and because of that competition for
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
those funds again
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
an unintended consequence
 
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.470 align:start position:0%
an unintended consequence
um

01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
how do you do how do you spread those
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
funds out if you go to an online
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
system and i'll let jeff speak more to
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody um as mr dunlop
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
you said my name is jeff obertank i've
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
been with the division of motor vehicles
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
for about uh 22 years now
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
20 years on the driver licensing side in
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
the last two on the registration side
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the reasons to the move to
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
the registration side was to seek out
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
efficiencies and better ways to do
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
business in a timely manner and
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
and be more customer service friendly
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
interesting to me when i started this
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
was that the registration process we
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
know for everything we have has to be
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
done in the town you live in
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's where boats are different
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
boat registrations can happen anywhere
 
01:40:47.189 --> 01:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
and depending on where you register the
 
01:40:47.199 --> 01:40:48.149 align:start position:0%
and depending on where you register the
boat

01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
boat
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
as tim said that's where the money stays
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh and so as an example uh when i
 
01:40:57.669 --> 01:40:57.679 align:start position:0%
started um i got to know the
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
town clerks association which we have
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
the president of the town clerks
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
association here today and one of their
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
asks of us the dmv
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
was how do we get boats online so
 
01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:08.950 align:start position:0%
was how do we get boats online so
great

01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
i got online driver license renewal
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
online ticket pay i helped get a lot of
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
those things over the finish line on the
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
driver's side
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
tim quickly jumped in and said time out
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
before you rush to get boats online um
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to take away more of our
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
revenue and up to 50 of the marine
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
patrol budget comes from registrations
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
so as an example i just want to run
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
through a couple of numbers here today
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
and in 2018
 
01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.229 align:start position:0%
and in 2018
um

01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
agents for the state which would be boat
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
marinas or
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
town clerks took in about 3.4 million
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
dollars in boat registration revenue and
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
the department of safety took in about
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
2.4 million dollars in revenue um
 
01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
as cobit hit and people were looking for
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
that convenience and they were looking
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
one-stop shopping
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'll fast forward to
 
01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:01.990 align:start position:0%
i'll fast forward to
year

01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.750 align:start position:0%
year
2021

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
the towns took in 4.4 million dollars in
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
revenue and the state took in 1.7
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
so as you can see as people seek out
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
those efficiencies and they seek out to
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
be able to do that one-stop shopping
 
01:42:16.239 --> 01:42:18.310 align:start position:0%
be able to do that one-stop shopping
model

01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're taking away a big chunk of marine
 
01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
patrol's revenue
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
and and from my standpoint
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
the the process of tying
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
the registration fees to funding marine
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
patrol works out perfectly because here
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
we're in a year where
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
last year we registered 107 000 boats
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
which pre-covet is about 15 000 more
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
than we've ever done in history right
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
everybody wanted to get outside
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
boating was the thing to do where you
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
could be with your family and those
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
types of things so the numbers shot up
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
well fifteen thousand more boats means
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
that we need more patrol we need more
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
education we need more officers on the
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
water if you have a down year and you're
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
only registering 80 000 votes or so
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
then you don't need as much money so
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
tying it to the registration works in
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
that regard historically
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
but where the money goes depending on
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
who registers it is the thing that we
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
need to fix
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
and again we do have the town clerks
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
association president here as well
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
we understand moving the the model
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
online they very much want to provide
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
that service for their citizens they
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
want to reduce their footprint as well
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
people don't have to come into the
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
office you can register your car online
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
why can't you register a boat online
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
we've hesitated because of this and
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that we can hook on
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the coast guard fixes and the things
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
that they need
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
to moving towards a better funding
 
01:43:40.719 --> 01:43:42.390 align:start position:0%
to moving towards a better funding
stream

01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
stream
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
seeing where things go
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
um so that we can get the online model
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
that the citizens are asking for and and
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
with that i'll um i'll take any
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:43:59.590 --> 01:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
said that town clerks are here
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
have you had discussions with the town
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
clerk about
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps agreeing on a split percentage
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
instead of they keep their money and you
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
keep your money if you went online and
 
01:44:22.790 --> 01:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
you just put it all in a pool i'm just
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
example you give 60 the towns get 40 no
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
matter where
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
the fees come from
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
we have that's uh and that has to be
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
something we pursue through legislation
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
um currently right now as you see from
 
01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
what mr dunleavy gave to you it's it's
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
pretty clear what we can take in and
 
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
where the money goes based on the two
 
01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:44.070 align:start position:0%
where the money goes based on the two
statutes

01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we're kind of the thought process
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
says we're going to lift the hood and
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
fix those coast guard elements then
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
let's find a way to get the revenue
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
um this is for uh captain dunn olivia
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
follow up if if my math is correct
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that goes to the
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
other state agencies on a hundred
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
thousand boats is like a million seven
 
01:45:08.639 --> 01:45:09.910 align:start position:0%
thousand boats is like a million seven
hundred

01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
and and i'm wondering do you have an
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
idea of a suggestion how would we make
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
up for those
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
agencies the million seven hundred
 
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:20.870 align:start position:0%
agencies the million seven hundred
dollars

01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's a tremendous question
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you we are we are
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
exploring uh we are not the only state
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
that is wrestling with this issue with
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
the federal government at this time we
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
are exploring an avenue in which we can
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
still preserve
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
those revenues for those outside
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
agencies and meet uh the requirements of
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
federal statute um
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
and and so we are working with the coast
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
guard on that matter right now
 
01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.550 align:start position:0%
guard on that matter right now
um

01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:46.470 --> 01:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
but but what they're using for the
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
litmus test
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
is that if a person walks in to register
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
their boat
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
and all they want to do is pay
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
what it costs them to be able to get a
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
decal to go out fishing that afternoon
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's what the federal government wants
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
they don't want to have
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
something attached to that transaction
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
that has anything to do
 
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
with anything but that boat registration
 
01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
with anything but that boat registration
so

01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
exploring one lump tax and then behind
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
the scenes dispersing it
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
they've said you can't do it it's still
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
going to be in statute saying that's
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
where those revenues go
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
so we're working with them on a solution
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
some states have achieved that and and
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
that's where we would be seeking
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
legislative relief and the changes to
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
accommodate those revenues to those
 
01:46:32.159 --> 01:46:35.270 align:start position:0%
accommodate those revenues to those
agencies

01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
one other quick point i'll point out
 
01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.310 align:start position:0%
one other quick point i'll point out
that

01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:41.590 --> 01:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
it has become known by the towns that
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
here's an availability for for funds for
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
simply providing a service and i and i'm
 
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.629 align:start position:0%
simply providing a service and i and i'm
not

01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
the competition for these funds is not
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
something that marine patrol
 
01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:55.350 align:start position:0%
something that marine patrol
um

01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
we're against the competition but we're
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
not against the fact that the towns are
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
receiving these revenues they use it in
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous ways on their waterfront
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
whether they're supporting and repairing
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
and providing town docks or whether
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're uh helping
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
add additional funds to uh the fight of
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
aquatic invasive species and their
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
section of their lakes
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of ways that that
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
these revenues are being used by the
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
towns and given back to the boater who
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
is shouldering this
 
01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.030 align:start position:0%
is shouldering this
revenue

01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
fact is there are some towns that don't
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
have a single acre of public waters
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
within their boundaries that are
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
receiving revenues from
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
about registration
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
and i think it was the intent of the
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
legislature in the early 90s
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
for that user pays user benefits system
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr i actually have two
 
01:47:52.950 --> 01:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
questions one for the chair and then one
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
for our guests um the question for the
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
chair do we know who authored this
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
legislation because i don't have it
 
01:48:00.159 --> 01:48:02.470 align:start position:0%
legislation because i don't have it
in

01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
because i obviously uh as soon as you
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
said online registration i looked over
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
at captain eastman and smiled because
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
that was a previous bill that actually
 
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
this committee did pass and has gone to
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's desk for ohrv and
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
snowmobile so i'm very interested in
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
this to sort of make life for our
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
visitors or our state residents
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
um in the efforts of you know promoting
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
it was going to be
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
taxing votes by the by no rate
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
right it was just not worth
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
it it was using the mill rate that
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
replied to motor vehicles
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
and and that that's fine for some boats
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the value of the
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
average cost of a new boat now being
 
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 to 40 for an automobile you're
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
looking 100 to 150 for boat so for those
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
that class of boats it would have been a
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
tremendous tremendous expense
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
that just
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
right while not a good bill it was the
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
it actually unearthed a good problem to
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
try and solve without beer
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
so my question then for our either one
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
of you are there states that are doing
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
this well or have that you both we
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
referenced you know that have done this
 
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
well or or have achieved
 
01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:33.830 align:start position:0%
well or or have achieved
um

01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
looking at this that
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
we as legislators could look at and try
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
and glean
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
some insight from
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
certainly the state of connecticut is
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
just i'm told by the coast guard uh a a
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
pretty good model to follow and so i
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
well i haven't laid eyes on that model
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
yet uh i do have a calling today
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
01:50:08.159 --> 01:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
time

01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:24.310 align:start position:0%
 
268

01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
american enslavement
 
01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:27.910 align:start position:0%
american enslavement
uh

01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
this there will be a subcommittee on
 
01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:37.109 align:start position:0%
this there will be a subcommittee on
this

01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman senator
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
david waters district four and i
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate working with the opportunity
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
to work with the
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but for the full committee
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to note a couple of things
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
briefly um
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
if you've had a chance to familiarize
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
herself with the underlying
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
existing statute on burying grounds
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
you have seen that we already have a
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
process whereby municipalities or others
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
wishing to
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
do something about these bearing grounds
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:51:09.669 --> 01:51:09.679 align:start position:0%
contact the descendant community and if
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
they cannot be identified do a posting
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the newspaper and work with town
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
officials and as you recall this bill
 
01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.510 align:start position:0%
officials and as you recall this bill
adds

01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
adds
 
01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.629 align:start position:0%
adds
the

01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:18.639 --> 01:51:20.470 align:start position:0%
the
constitution

01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
with um a representative organization of
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
the descendant community so um based on
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
you're hearing i just want to mention
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
two two possible things um
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
on line
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
eight and nine
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about naming the black
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
heritage trail of new hampshire
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
and it occurred to me that we could just
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
do here what we do for native american
 
01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.390 align:start position:0%
do here what we do for native american
graves

01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
graves
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
and let the historical resources
 
01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.229 align:start position:0%
and let the historical resources
designate

01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
designate
 
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
the representative community so it could
 
01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.350 align:start position:0%
the representative community so it could
say

01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
or an organization
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
representing representative of
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
the african-american descent community
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
as designated by the new hampshire
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources um and
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
as i said that's what they do with
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
native american
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
graves and they could certainly
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
figure out who's best for municipality
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
to consult with there
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
um secondly uh
 
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the second page of the
 
01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:17.109 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the second page of the
bill

01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
the section at the bottom
 
01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:20.589 align:start position:0%
the section at the bottom
lines

01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
33-36 about examining collections for
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
remains of
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
african-americans from the period of
 
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.149 align:start position:0%
african-americans from the period of
enslavement

01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
enslavement
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
that i think that perhaps it makes sense
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
just to keep it to that
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
and on line 33 strike any other and any
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
other remains of people of african
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
descent born after the period of
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
american slavery
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
and similarly on lines 35 36
 
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
and i recommend this because i think it
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
simplifies it and also because i've
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
become aware that
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
there is international treaty language
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
that covers um
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
materials that may have been removed
 
01:52:58.880 --> 01:52:59.910 align:start position:0%
materials that may have been removed
from

01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:01.109 align:start position:0%
from
african

01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
african
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
countries whether bones you know remains
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
or grave goods and the united states is
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
a signatory to that treaty they have
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
meetings regularly and determine such
 
01:53:14.550 --> 01:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
things as repatriation of of grave items
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
and otherwise so there's no point in our
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that in state
 
01:53:18.239 --> 01:53:19.589 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that in state
statute

01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
so this would be just be that if you
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
have human remains in
 
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
state you know medical collections or in
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
historical societies and i mentioned and
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
or universities i mentioned before i do
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
know of at least one case of this and i
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
suspect there are more that then this
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
will be an opportunity to uh
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
do the right thing by those human
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
remains thank you mr chairman and i look
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the subcommittee
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments from members
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:51.189 align:start position:0%
of the
committee

01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator um
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have the bill in front of me
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
could you perhaps cross out on us draft
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%

send everyone a

make copies of this article lawmakers
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
slam brakes on protecting the black
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
grave sites i don't know if uh if
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
everybody was able to i wasn't able to
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%

here's
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%

all right
uh

01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.679 --> 01:55:38.470 align:start position:0%
 
it's

01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know interesting readings
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
take a you know jeeps last night
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
spent some time just you know going over
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
to bill the bill actually didn't even go
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
over all of it just uh
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
but i was just
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
we needed we do need a
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this simply because we
 
01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:00.950 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this simply because we
need

01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
to hear from
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
the people who are affected and those
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
who are
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
doing the uh
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
the job of
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
keeping up the cemeteries and the grave
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
sites and that we never heard from them
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
there was no testimony of that so we
 
01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:18.149 align:start position:0%
there was no testimony of that so we
need

01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
we need that testimony uh
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
and we need to so we can judge the
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
impact that
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
this bill might have on him uh and
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
how many graves are we talking about
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
is there any data on that uh
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman a couple of things
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
i i the division of historical resources
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
regretted they hadn't been able to send
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
someone to the original hearing because
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
they're the one of the bodies that that
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
deals with this um as as well as some
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
local cemetery officials but again
 
01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
bearing grounds are in this funny
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
category because they're not town
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
cemeteries um they are owned by the
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
descendants of the community
 
01:56:59.270 --> 01:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
as far as how many there are
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
we'll hit a hundred burial sites
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
for african americans from the period of
 
01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.030 align:start position:0%
for african americans from the period of
enslavement

01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
enslavement
 
01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.070 align:start position:0%
enslavement
um

01:57:08.070 --> 01:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
that are actually burial sites rather
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
than just single graves
 
01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.149 align:start position:0%
than just single graves
yes

01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:57:16.149 --> 01:57:16.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean there are there are many
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
many and we're being rediscovered
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
um you know yearly
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
and if i don't i can't give an exact
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
figure but i will say that there were
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
there were thousands of people
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
enslaved in new hampshire during the
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
period of enslavement
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
so there are many there are thousands of
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
burials whether or not they have been
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
identified or they're in
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
distinct burial grounds um but this is a
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
lot of the kind of ongoing work of
 
01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:45.679 align:start position:0%
black history organizations and local
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
cemetery buffs too
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
and are you looking
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
do you expect that there there should be
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
a different set of statutes or laws
 
01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:59.189 align:start position:0%
a different set of statutes or laws
concerning

01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
established graveyards
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
versus discoveries of uh
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
of burial grounds that
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
either were
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
lost to history or we didn't even know
 
01:58:11.679 --> 01:58:14.470 align:start position:0%
lost to history or we didn't even know
existed

01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:15.189 align:start position:0%
 
because

01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
i would assume that the
 
01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.510 align:start position:0%
i would assume that the
the

01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
well the whole the whole techniques that
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
to do what you have to do is uh
 
01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:28.550 align:start position:0%
to do what you have to do is uh
is

01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:30.229 --> 01:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
is radically different
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question mr
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
chairman so if you look in um statute
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we have kind of two
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
separate areas one is cemeteries
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
which are public
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
publicly or religious organization owned
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
and then there are burying grounds which
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
are the property essentially of the
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
people buried there and their
 
01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:51.669 align:start position:0%
people buried there and their
descendants

01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
descendants
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
and they have a separate statutory
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
language because the town does not own
 
01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
them unless they have voted to take
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for them and most towns
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
won't do that because then they'll have
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
to fence them and pay for upkeep and and
 
01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
so on
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
there are many african-americans from
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
the period of enslavement who are buried
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
in existing cemeteries so up in
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
canterbury here in concord you know
 
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
portsmouth throughout
 
01:59:17.589 --> 01:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
there are people now they may be buried
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
down in a swampy area or sometimes
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're buried just outside the wall but
 
01:59:25.510 --> 01:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
those folks are
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
essentially taken care of by the by the
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
town and so this bill
 
01:59:35.189 --> 01:59:35.199 align:start position:0%
um does not particularly apply to them
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
i would think that
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
if a community
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
in its cemetery was going to do
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
improvements or wanted to do a you know
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
particular commemoration or a marking or
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
replace the stone
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
or an african american who or s who may
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
never have had a gravestone um then that
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
they would certainly want to consult
 
01:59:55.270 --> 01:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
with the communities but this gets this
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
gets at this
 
01:59:58.870 --> 01:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an interesting section of
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
wall bearing bearing ground law because
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
the property you know who owns the
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
property is just
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh you know we have so many of
 
02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
these um bearing grounds in new
 
02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:09.109 align:start position:0%
these um bearing grounds in new
hampshire

02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh and so that's why this this addresses
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
that because that frankly is where most
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
african-american spirit of enslavement
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
are buried because um townspeople did
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
not want them
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
in the public cemetery or they'd be
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
buried out on the farm
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
or behind the house where they were
 
02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:29.910 align:start position:0%
or behind the house where they were
enslaved

02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
enslaved
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know a funny example for example is
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
in amherst where there's several
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
african-americans who were enslaved
 
02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:39.189 align:start position:0%
african-americans who were enslaved
buried

02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
buried
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's odd it was was that were
 
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
they buried in what was then part of the
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
cemetery or not
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
and then when they built a new beating
 
02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
house in the 1800s they built it on top
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
of part of those graves so
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know there's just a lot of each one
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
has its own circumstances and um you
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
know i think that because there are
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
people now who have experience in
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
working with these uh bearing grounds in
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that they
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
um are happy to provide
 
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:07.189 align:start position:0%
um are happy to provide
some

02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
expertise and and there are lots of
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
reasons why they should if somebody's
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
doing work in an african bearing ground
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
they may not recognize
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
that pieces of shell broken pottery or
 
02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.669 align:start position:0%
that pieces of shell broken pottery or
even

02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
even
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
salt sprinkled on top of the
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
grave our african practices and they
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
just think they may be trash
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
um so anyways it's just a
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
scenario that uh
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
in in statute we could um say hey let's
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
let's include these organizations who
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
kind of know how to respectfully treat
 
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
the remains of these
 
02:02:00.550 --> 02:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh i i can answer a couple ways um
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know if you're doing some work to
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
improve a bearing ground um that often
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
then there'd be an agreement over how to
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
do that and that's actually required an
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
we already have that that if you're
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
going to do some work at a bearing
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
ground you have to get
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
approval from the town
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
you have a right to do it
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
under statute but you have you have to
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
go through a process and this would also
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
as i said in my opening comments that
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
it would be you know maybe better if you
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to just name one organization
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
to let the
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
um historical resources as it does with
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
does with native american graves fine
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
and appropriate
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
representatives of the descendant
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
community depending on location tribal
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
affiliation and so on to do that
 
02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:05.430 align:start position:0%
affiliation and so on to do that
um

02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
now the black cardistry of new hampshire
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
has undertaken and has substantial
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
funding for placement of
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
markers and monuments to commemorate
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
african americans in our state they just
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
did one over in warner
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to remember the other
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
town um
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
and there are others that are you know
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
that are underway we have a
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
lot of trail markers in
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
portsmouth but now it's going statewide
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
and so when those are placed um
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
they uh have
 
02:03:36.239 --> 02:03:37.109 align:start position:0%
they uh have
a

02:03:37.109 --> 02:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
bronze plaque that is on a granite
 
02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:40.550 align:start position:0%
bronze plaque that is on a granite
boulder

02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
boulder
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
that has the information about the
 
02:03:42.639 --> 02:03:43.990 align:start position:0%
that has the information about the
individual

02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
and the black heritage trail
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
has a refuge fiduciary responsibility
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance repair
 
02:03:51.599 --> 02:03:52.470 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance repair
or

02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
whatever is needed on that on that so
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
a little clarification um so
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
they where do they get their funds
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh well um there are there are grants uh
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
they've received substantial grants from
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
national organizations and state
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
organizations you go to their website
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
and see their finances they also
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
raise hundreds of thousands of dollars a
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
year for i mean if you participated in a
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
juneteenth program over the last weekend
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
over saw one that was all black heritage
 
02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:27.910 align:start position:0%
over saw one that was all black heritage
trail

02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
trail
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
sponsored and then july 1st around the
 
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
state including concord they're going to
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
be readings of frederick douglass's
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
4th of july address so anyways
 
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of visibility for their
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
programs but they have
 
02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:41.189 align:start position:0%
programs but they have
uh

02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
funding that they they raise they're a
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit and they raise money okay
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
a final question so uh
 
02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:49.669 align:start position:0%
a final question so uh
to

02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
get a lock on it
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
would would this involve in any way
 
02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:55.830 align:start position:0%
would would this involve in any way
funds

02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
state funds going to the black heritage
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
trail or
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
entirely a private
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
thing in terms of the fiduciary
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility would be an entirely
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
private thing
 
02:05:15.030 --> 02:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah and just to note any
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
improvement that is done in a burying

ground now
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
right now does not bear any any fetish
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility from the
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
municipality because the municipality
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't own it great that's very helpful
 
02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:30.390 align:start position:0%
doesn't own it great that's very helpful
thanks

02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
thanks

is it except i do have to
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
if we have what we say
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
one subcommittee on
 
02:06:06.719 --> 02:06:08.390 align:start position:0%
one subcommittee on
uh

02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:10.069 align:start position:0%
uh
426

02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
426
 
02:06:10.079 --> 02:06:11.430 align:start position:0%
426
and

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:13.669 align:start position:0%
and
257.

02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
257.
 
02:06:13.679 --> 02:06:14.830 align:start position:0%
257.
another

02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:22.229 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
navigation safety fund
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.719 --> 02:06:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
258

02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:06:42.550 --> 02:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
did uh there's i know i know we were
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
short quite a few people
 
02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:48.069 align:start position:0%
short quite a few people
here

02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
people want to call me and
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
send me an email want to be on which
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
i will be at all of them i will be on
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
you should probably leave me a lot
 
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
beyond one i'll be on some simply
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
because i might not get enough people
 
02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:13.830 align:start position:0%
because i might not get enough people
so

02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
when are we allowed to come back to work
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh in uh i think it's the last week in
 
02:07:20.159 --> 02:07:21.270 align:start position:0%
uh in uh i think it's the last week in
august

02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
august
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i know september i thought
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
it might have been
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
it might have been the last week in
 
02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:41.750 align:start position:0%
it might have been the last week in
august

02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
i thought it was the last few days in
 
02:07:44.239 --> 02:07:46.310 align:start position:0%
i thought it was the last few days in
august

02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
august
 
02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
i'll check in the front office
 
02:07:49.830 --> 02:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll send something out on that
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
maybe that
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
and people just uh
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then if i looks like i can't i don't
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
huh

02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
huh
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're available
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay but uh and and i will i will
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh most september we're going to be
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
probably doing the most of the work in
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
september and in october is when we'll
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.310 --> 02:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:00.629 --> 02:09:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
going to that's going to the
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh eleven eight of
 
02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:08.310 align:start position:0%
uh eleven eight of
1188.

02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah there's going to be that commission
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we may
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
we may find that we may if that doesn't
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
get passed and that gets vetoed well
 
02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:20.550 align:start position:0%
get passed and that gets vetoed well
then

02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
we can revisit correct if it doesn't
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
revisit everything we did today
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
was strictly to get our bearings
 
02:09:34.870 --> 02:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
to know where we stand
 
02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:35.910 align:start position:0%
to know where we stand
uh

02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:36.950 align:start position:0%
uh
the

02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:37.830 align:start position:0%
the
the

02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
the pfast stuff
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
we went over i mean we're basically
 
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know pfast is a very
 
02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:52.790 align:start position:0%
you know pfast is a very
uh

02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:56.790 --> 02:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
and so we don't want we
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
but it's also uh we feel that
 
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
the edes seems to be on top of it
 
02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:06.069 align:start position:0%
the edes seems to be on top of it
and

02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:06.079 --> 02:10:07.589 align:start position:0%
and
looks

02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
looks
 
02:10:10.149 --> 02:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
so we'll just carry these along
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh just to uh
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
just just to show them the respect that
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
it deserve that they deserve
 
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:25.030 align:start position:0%
it deserve that they deserve
uh

02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
all right uh but uh just
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe i won't i won't uh
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
i won't put any pressure on anybody but
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
i i will be
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
calling around if i don't hear from
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
people if i don't have enough
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
i've usually want at least five people
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:18.629 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.639 --> 02:11:20.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
i was very discouraged
 
02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:34.310 align:start position:0%
i was very discouraged
that

02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
i cannot i cannot predict what i don't
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
know how we can get a sense of
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.310 --> 02:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
will serve on the subcommittee but you
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
understand why i would consider it to be
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
um they are revamping that too
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:39.830 align:start position:0%
like that
so

02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily what
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
just because uh you know what what
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
becomes a law is something different
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
for inst for instance
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
there may be an issue and we may not
 
02:13:15.199 --> 02:13:16.470 align:start position:0%
there may be an issue and we may not
like

02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
we may say yes there is an issue
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
but the solution you bring for that to
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
that for that issue
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's called politic
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
i mean people
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
we we do have
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:13:41.350 --> 02:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
what we like is not necessarily what is
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:57.440 --> 02:13:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:13:59.910 --> 02:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
no the what where
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
no uh
 
02:14:01.679 --> 02:14:02.870 align:start position:0%
no uh
the

02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
they could they could make suggest
 
02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:06.390 align:start position:0%
they could they could make suggest
suggestions

02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
for what to do and i think they are
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
making suggestions for what they do we
 
02:14:13.990 --> 02:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
may say we agree that there you we may
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
say that there we agree there is an
 
02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:17.109 align:start position:0%
say that there we agree there is an
issue

02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
the solution you give us
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be very difficult
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
to fix something if we don't know
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
what the members of the committee
 
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.390 --> 02:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
like we brought up
 
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
so that well that's nonsense
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
so how do you
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
come up with a solution if you don't
 
02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:36.550 --> 02:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
sounded pretty reasonable and clarifying
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
and you know i mean i really would like
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
to see but
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
figure out okay so what exactly is a law
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
saying now how can we make it stronger
 
02:15:45.199 --> 02:15:46.709 align:start position:0%
saying now how can we make it stronger
without

02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
making it more clear
 
02:15:48.639 --> 02:16:02.629 align:start position:0%
making it more clear
so

02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
how can we protect
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
the lakes
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
and the rivers and the bay
 
02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:14.229 align:start position:0%
and the rivers and the bay
from

02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
septic systems that aren't working
 
02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
and we know this building works so what
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
if parts of it can use and what can we
 
02:16:27.589 --> 02:16:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.830 --> 02:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
that it could do some way to put
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
maybe even another
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:29.589 --> 02:17:29.599 align:start position:0%
water going into a river
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
they thought it was one particular house
 
02:17:34.709 --> 02:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
they ended up cutting their septic
 
02:17:34.719 --> 02:17:35.830 align:start position:0%
they ended up cutting their septic
systems

02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
destroying their subject system because
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the plans to
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
to pay for that
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
engineer system
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
and it turned out to be another
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
homeowner upstream so i mean you're
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
putting a lot of people in bad positions
 
02:17:52.559 --> 02:17:53.349 align:start position:0%
putting a lot of people in bad positions
with

02:17:53.349 --> 02:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
having this super expensive person that
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
has to come in so maybe that's
 
02:18:02.309 --> 02:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
are you talking about
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:44.309 --> 02:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're having to
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
i can jump in on that i don't think i
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
don't think the statue gives the
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
authority to wave it what they're waving
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
is home inspections because they do
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
reels they're waving home inspection
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
but i tell my clients that if there's a
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
shoreline protection statute that says
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
you have to have this report
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
go get the report now it doesn't say
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
what you have to do once you get the
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
report it doesn't say if the report says
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
the system's gonna fail you have to
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
upgrade but you you just get the report
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
and you read it and it's signed and it
 
02:19:30.950 --> 02:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
gets filed with the board of health the
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
question i always brought up and even
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
listening to mr dears is
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know i practice folk in new
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire and massachusetts i just keep
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
hearing more things that lead me to
 
02:19:44.950 --> 02:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
think it'll be a
 
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
title five nick paul in
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
massachusetts septic system requirement
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
totally in favor of title five what
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
happens in mass is
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
every system
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
before you can sell a house whether
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're shoreline or not has to be
 
02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:03.510 align:start position:0%
you're shoreline or not has to be
inspected

02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
the inspection is about a 10-page report
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
signed by a licensed inspector not a
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
installer but an inspector
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
that goes to the board of health that
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
gets passed on to the homeowner and if
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
that inspector says it fails
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah the homeowner has to upgrade it or
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
the new owner has to upgrade it you have
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
two years to upgrade it so what they've
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
been doing in years in massachusetts is
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's a spot thing if they have a problem
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
here it gets found and somebody's got to
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
fix it or you got to tie into the septic
 
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
fix it or you got to tie into the septic
system

02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
and they were hoping and i don't have
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
any test results for you
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
but the plan was
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
with that put in place
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're correcting all failed systems
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll make them upgrade
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
there's not there's some money from the
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
state for credits for upgrading your
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
system but i heard
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
mr dears talk about other funds and
 
02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:05.030 align:start position:0%
mr dears talk about other funds and
credits

02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
credits
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
but i think the whole discussion is
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
coming to
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
that do we really want something like
 
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire that's what i look
 
02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:15.670 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire that's what i look
at

02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
if this
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity is not take
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
that accepting systems will continue
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
to throw these plates because people
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is job for the
 
02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:24.630 align:start position:0%
this is job for the
subcommittee

02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know we're gonna we can be here till
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
next week arguing over the exact same
 
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
well do it on your own time
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i mean i got to you know
 
02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:40.389 align:start position:0%
i mean i mean i got to you know
but

02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
chuck you uh yeah mr chairman i'd be
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
happy to serve on this in fact i'd like
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
to serve on this committee because i
 
02:22:47.349 --> 02:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
both experience as being a planner in a
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
short in a lakeshore community and also
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of research on um
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
private septic systems or innovative
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
septic systems for community for for
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
private communities and and public
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
communities as well and i think that if
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
you've got these two bills that we're
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
looking at and into one uh that ted
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
spoke on both of them today i think
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of experience that i can
 
02:23:10.389 --> 02:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
bring to the table as well and in
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
discussions on these things and i being
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
certainly being sympathetic to
 
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
what judith's argument is is that you
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
know working in the in a lakeshore
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
community i have seen all kinds of
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
problems with failed septic systems
 
02:23:25.910 --> 02:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
and uh it's certainly something that
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
does need to be done with because we're
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually paying a lot of money in state
 
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:30.870 align:start position:0%
actually paying a lot of money in state
funds

02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
to treat the the problem
 
02:23:35.030 --> 02:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know the effect that these fail
 
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
systems have i mean we're spending tons
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
of money for dealing with nitrogen in in
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
lake winnipesaukee and other lakes in
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
our state
 
02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:41.990 align:start position:0%
our state
and

02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
much of it is due to failed septic
 
02:23:44.399 --> 02:23:45.510 align:start position:0%
much of it is due to failed septic
systems

02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
systems
 
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
and it's it's you know it's not just
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
water on the waterfront but within a
 
02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:50.389 align:start position:0%
water on the waterfront but within a
certain

02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
distance from the lake you know i've
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
seen septic systems that are quite a
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
ways from lake that are that we're
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
basically leaking right into the the
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
lake and nobody's inspecting these
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
things and nobody's requiring that
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
they'd be done and we need to we need to
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
have something that is going to take a
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
look at these and how we do them i'm not
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
saying you know as as bob you know we
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
may not want to do the whole state but
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
we want to do something that's within a
 
02:24:20.309 --> 02:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i think uh we're over we're riding
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're running over and
 
02:24:32.790 --> 02:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
i think i think we're just petering out
 
02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:33.750 align:start position:0%
i think i think we're just petering out
but

02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:35.110 align:start position:0%
but
uh

02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
are we done
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you

let me know if you want who wants to be
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
on what committee you know

on what committee you know
okay

02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
