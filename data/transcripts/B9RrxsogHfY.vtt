00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone and welcome to the
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
tuesday february 8th meeting of the
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
five public hearings that we will
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
conduct during the course of today
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
obviously with the
 
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
traffic accident on
 
00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
interstate 93
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
folks are going to be filing in slowly
 
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
over the course of the
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
next uh several minutes
 
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.470 align:start position:0%
next uh several minutes
and

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're gonna have to go
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
ahead and get started
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
both to
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
be respectful of people who showed up
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
here to testify this morning and also to
 
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.470 align:start position:0%
here to testify this morning and also to
continue

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
continue
to

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
operate the committee in an efficient
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
manner but before i call on the
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
opening speaker our very first duty this
 
00:03:58.799 --> 00:03:59.750 align:start position:0%
opening speaker our very first duty this
morning

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
is to all rise and join together as
 
00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi leads us in the
 
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay so before we get begin a couple of
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
housekeeping measures if you would like
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
to testify on this or any other bill
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
before the committee today
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
you must fill out and submit a pink card
 
00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
and pass it along
 
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
the table
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
so that it reaches
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
myself and the clerk
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's how we
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
keep track of who wants to testify
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
on a bill
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
also it's been pointed out to me by
 
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative thomas that if there is
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
anyone here who is hard of hearing
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh microphone jack on the side of these
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
microphones that we all have sitting in
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
front of us and if you have headphones
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
you could plug in to the microphone jack
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
and listen to testimony that way rather
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
than having to rely on the testimony
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
coming through the speakers
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
i didn't realize that but representative
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
thomas pointed that out this morning so
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's something you can take advantage
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
with that oh one other thing that i
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
would remind committee members about
 
00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 align:start position:0%
yesterday we conducted an exec session
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
on five bills there were
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
minority reports assigned if you have
 
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
been assigned a minority report i need
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
that report by 5 pm
 
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.150 align:start position:0%
that report by 5 pm
today

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
so with that i will open the public
 
00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
1596 fn relative to net
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
energy metering limits for individual
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
and business customers
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
and i will turn the floor over to the
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
bill's prime sponsor
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative rebecca mcwilliams
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairvoz it's a pleasure to be
 
00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
here fellow members of science
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
technology and energy for the record my
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
name is representative rebecca
 
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
name is representative rebecca
mcwilliams

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
mcwilliams
 
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
i represent the west side of concord
 
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to talk about raising net
 
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.670 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to talk about raising net
energy

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
metering limits from one to five
 
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.790 align:start position:0%
metering limits from one to five
megawatts

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
and i know we've had robust discussions
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
about this in the past i just want to
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
touch on a couple of points of history
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
on this specific topic
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
when i joined science technology and
 
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.430 align:start position:0%
when i joined science technology and
energy

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
four years ago
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
we were able to come to a bipartisan
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
consensus on passing increases in net
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
net energy metering from one to five
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
megawatts here in the house
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
we were also able to pass it out the
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
other body
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
it was then subsequently vetoed by our
 
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.870 align:start position:0%
it was then subsequently vetoed by our
governor

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we had an override session to try to
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
override that specific bill
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
and we were awful close to being able to
 
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
do that we almost got our two-thirds
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
majority so there was definitely a
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
desire by the constituents and by the
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
elected officials of new hampshire four
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
years ago to get us over that threshold
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
and reach net energy metering so that we
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
could open up the market for
 
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.270 align:start position:0%
could open up the market for
additional

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
so in addition
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
net metering is something that the
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
states around us have been doing
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
successfully for quite some time we know
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
that massachusetts has a
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
4.99999 megawatt limit
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
maine and vermont have also reached the
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
same conclusion that it's good for the
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
market and it's good for creating local
 
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.629 align:start position:0%
market and it's good for creating local
energy

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we have as a
 
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
challenge here in new hampshire is that
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
aside from nuclear which we are very
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
good at producing
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
most of our energy comes from out of
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
state so we're looking at hydropower
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
from the north
 
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.869 align:start position:0%
from the north
and

00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
natural gas from pipelines coming from
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
outside of new hampshire
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
so increasing the net energy metering
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
limit would allow us to then open up the
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
market to increase homegrown energy for
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
private companies and private businesses
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
who would like to do larger solar arrays
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
but right now due to business
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
constraints are not able to do so
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
because the numbers just don't make
 
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.070 align:start position:0%
because the numbers just don't make
sense

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
but in terms of competition and seeing
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
the other states around us as
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
competition in the northeast energy
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
market since we all fall under iso new
 
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.350 align:start position:0%
market since we all fall under iso new
england

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
england
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for us to open it up and
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
increase net energy metering so that we
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
can be competitive with the states
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
around us and so that we're not losing
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
out on these opportunities for solar
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
developments that are going to other
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
states because new hampshire is not
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
considered an opportune state right now
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
without the increase in net energy
 
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.190 align:start position:0%
without the increase in net energy
metering

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
so this the intent of this bill is to
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
build on the success that we had last
 
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.790 align:start position:0%
build on the success that we had last
year

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
year
which

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
which if you recall we passed a bill to
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to increase their
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
net energy metering from one to five
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
megawatts i know that was a huge win for
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that already had hydro
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
to go bigger and be able to spin the
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
meter backwards at a larger scale
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
and so i'd like to now open it up a
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
little bit further to private businesses
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
and large landowners who are looking to
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
do solar arrays or perhaps large hydro
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
on a private scale because this would
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
benefit the private industry as well as
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities so with that i'm happy to
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams for that
 
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.389 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams for that
excellent

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill
 
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.750 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill
and

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
i would now
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
like to entertain questions from the
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
well i have a question
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
um i'll go first but then you're next
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note says that the department
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
of energy indicates that there is the
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
potential for this for state county and
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
local governments to see an increase in
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures due to the increased cost
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
of electricity that would result from
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
passage of this
 
00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:13.430 align:start position:0%
passage of this
legislation

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
do you think that
 
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.550 align:start position:0%
do you think that
local

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
governments would interpret that as the
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
state downshifting costs onto local
 
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
state downshifting costs onto local
governments

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's a little bit more complex
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
than just saying black and white
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
increasing net energy metering will
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of electricity
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
i think that's a broad statement i think
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
if we can parse that out a little bit
 
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
if we can parse that out a little bit
further

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
individual cost
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
for a greater good
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
right so we're talking about increasing
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
local homegrown energy
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
individual bills may see a very small
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
increase in the short term
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
but in the long term we're talking about
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
reducing transmission costs because it
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
is homegrown
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
so while there may be a little bit of a
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
curve as we ramp up and increase our
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
local homegrown solar larger arrays
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
overall we're going to see a leveling
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
and possibly reduction in transmission
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
cost because we are creating our own
 
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
cost because we are creating our own
energy

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
so the question about whether
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities would see that
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
uptick in initial cost as a
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
downshifting i think it really depends
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
on how you're characterizing it
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
obviously when the market changes and if
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
costs change then
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's there's going to be a reaction
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
from everyone who's involved in the game
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
but whether we call that a downshift or
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
just a change because the market has
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
changed is really a question for how
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
each municipality interprets the market
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
and what's happening
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that as a representative
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
from concord we have committed to going
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
to 100 renewable electricity by 2030 as
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
a city and so we are actively looking at
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
ways that we can create more
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
local zero
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
electricity right here in concord so for
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
the city
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think they would call that a
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
downshift i think they would say this is
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing business because we
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
have committed to
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
zero emissions
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial was
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative williams
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
um can you speak a bit to uh how you
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
view this is uh would it stabilize our
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
would it um
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
would it prove our good stability in new
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
england or do you think it would be have
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
any effect at all
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
well grid stability is a great question
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
because we've all been following texas
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sure um with another deep freeze
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
happening and folks losing the ability
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
to control their own heat and
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
losing power in texas right so grid
 
00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:51.509 align:start position:0%
losing power in texas right so grid
stability

00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
stability
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
comparing new england to texas is a very
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
different animal
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
because we are as i mentioned we are all
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
under the iso new england grid
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
so the reality is
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have stability in the new england
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
grid because we have diverse sources of
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
energy including hydro solar nuclear and
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
natural gas we're not reliant on just
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
one type of fuel and we also have
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
different weather than texas right so we
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
we make sure that things don't freeze
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
we've built things to be rated so that
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
when it gets really cold like it does in
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
new england and when we have ice storms
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
we won't lose power unless
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
obviously a tree falls on transmission
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
lines that happens and then we have an
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
immediate response to address that
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
because that's the market that we're in
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
so in terms of stability
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
i would say that adding additional
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
sources to the mix is always a good
 
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.310 align:start position:0%
sources to the mix is always a good
thing

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
certainly as government officials we are
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
always looking at the worst case
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
scenario because we have to worry about
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
those what-ifs
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know the big fear that there might
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
be some kind of an attack on our grid
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
from an outside source is always a real
 
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.389 align:start position:0%
from an outside source is always a real
concern

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
so as we move forward with the new era
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
of renewables in new england
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
talking about things like microgrids
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
which are self-contained and can
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
continue producing energy like the um
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
the durham campus unh durham where
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking to do a microgrid that's
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
self-contained so even if there were an
 
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.949 align:start position:0%
self-contained so even if there were an
incident

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
incident
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
attack on the grid they would still be
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
able to contain that specific area with
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
their own production and still continue
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
producing it's like its own
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
generator basically but we're talking
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
about not a fossil fuel generator but
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
renewable generation
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
so big picture using batteries and
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
renewable technology i think we're
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
getting closer to diversifying our mix
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
and therefore concerns about grid
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
stability are lessened but obviously we
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
can't say that for the entire state
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
right we still we heard plenty of
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
testimony yesterday about how new
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is an interesting state
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
because we have these dense municipal
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
areas in the southern portion of the
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
state and then we are certainly very
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
rural with vast open tracts of land
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
north of the notch and so when we talk
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
about grid stability there still is the
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
very real concern that not everyone is
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
stable and depending on weather or
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
national incidents or local incidents
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee or promise so i
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
would say that adding renewables to the
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
mix as a general rule is a good thing
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
it gives us more diversity and with
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
batteries it gives us more opportunity
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
to run in a microgrid manner
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
but this bill isn't really about
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
microgrids this bill is about enabling
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
large solar to happen privately
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
beyond just municipal developments here
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so we can keep up with
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and also so we can have
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
energy independence and do homegrown
 
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.749 align:start position:0%
energy independence and do homegrown
solar

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
solar
 
00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:49.110 align:start position:0%
solar
follow-up

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
no follow-up representative lewicki is
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative i
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
have two questions um and i don't know
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
the answers so these are not
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
by my leading questions one is
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
and recognizing the synergy between
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
solar and air conditioning in the summer
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
that's one piece but what do we get from
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
solar on a day like this in terms of
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of the maximum capacity
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
sure um this is one of the challenges
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
with renewables right the sun isn't
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
always shining
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
so working with batteries that would be
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
a time when you'd be drawing from your
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
solar battery instead of obviously on an
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
overcast day where it's basically
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
raining sideways
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be getting any solar
 
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.189 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be getting any solar
produced

00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
produced
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
but the idea here is that we're
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
diversifying the grids so we've created
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
something additional to add
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
and store for those times of peak demand
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
so it's not just about we have energy
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
when the sun is shining it is we collect
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
energy when the sun is shining so that
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
it can be reintroduced back through
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
batteries when it is not like today
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
okay and second question is
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
are there any major hydro sites that
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
haven't been exploited i believe that
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
the amis keg falls is 16 megawatts don't
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
quote me on that um and are we likely to
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
find hydro sites that will be in the
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
megawatts or are those all damned and
 
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
already producing power
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're asking about new hydro sites as
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to existing i'm not aware of but
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean they don't exist i've
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
certainly heard from hydro producers who
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
would be interested in being able to
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this bill who are not
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
connected with the
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities but their existing sites
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
um so my lack of knowledge doesn't mean
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
that there isn't one i'm just not aware
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel is recognized
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
if someone
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
if a company wanted to build a 4.99
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
megawatt array right now
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
what are their options for selling their
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
electric their excess electricity
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
now and how does that compare to
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
what would happen if your bill was
 
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.549 align:start position:0%
what would happen if your bill was
passed

00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
so right now when you do a development
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that's larger than one
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
megawatt you have to have a dedicated
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
off taker
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
so in rare instances where you have a
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
very large user
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
it still makes sense to pull the trigger
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
and do that because you're going to be
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
producing for yourself or the large user
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
who's nearby so an example of that would
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
be a huge manufacturing facility who's
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
decided that it makes sense to put solar
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
panels on the roof of their warehouse
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
because they want to have more than one
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
megawatt in order to offset their use
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's a business decision
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
when it comes to utilities as an
 
00:18:40.559 --> 00:18:41.669 align:start position:0%
when it comes to utilities as an
off-taker

00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
off-taker
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
you could potentially still put in your
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
4.99 megawatt system and get on the wait
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
list for the utility to do an analysis
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
and determine if there's a hookup
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
potential and what the cost of the
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
hookup is but you wouldn't be actually
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
getting the benefit of spinning the
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
meter backwards beyond the one megawatt
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
that we currently have so from a
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
business perspective it doesn't make
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
sense to look at going back to the
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
utility you would have to be looking to
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
go to a private source or i'm sorry a
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
you need a follow-up go ahead
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
you we would have to
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
basically sell your
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
excess electricity
 
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
to someone else as opposed to back to
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
the utility is that what i understand
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct um and
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
in in larger scale you know we have
 
00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:35.350 align:start position:0%
in in larger scale you know we have
midwestern

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
midwestern
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
renewable sources like wind
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
that sell their electricity to users in
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
new england right you can purchase
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
electricity from an alternative source
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
beyond just our utilities and so that
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:50.710 align:start position:0%
kind of a
plan

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
where you can have a large solar array
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
or a large wind farm that sells energy
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
across the nation to consumers who want
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be purchasing renewables that exists
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
now but i would say that the market in
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is not really set up for
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
that because there isn't that additional
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
benefit of spinning the meter backwards
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative plett is
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
that if you go to the utility you may
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
have to have a distribution analysis
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
essentially transmission analysis to
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
make sure it fits and you said that's a
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
good reason to go to
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
a business wouldn't that distribution
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
analysis still have to take place
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
because there may be a constraint on the
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
distribution or transmission system
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's a great point representative
 
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
that's a great point representative
plett

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
plett
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
whenever you're creating a large amount
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
of energy you have to make sure that the
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
off taker is capable of receiving it so
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
that may include up-sizing the
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
transmission lines or upgrading the
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
entire grid between wherever the energy
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
is being produced and the receiver
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
so there is a construction cost to
 
00:20:58.159 --> 00:20:59.350 align:start position:0%
so there is a construction cost to
upgrade

00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's a private or
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee is recognized
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chairman and
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.789 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
so

00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh i appreciate you giving the history i
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
was there for for it but um
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
i i think my question is around it
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
appears to me that this bill is designed
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
to help us
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
with a transition so that there there's
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
an economic support for people being
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
able to invest as they might otherwise
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't be getting credit for
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
the energy they're producing so
 
00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:36.549 align:start position:0%
the energy they're producing so
um

00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
can you say a little bit about the in
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of the re the retail energy
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
market here in new hampshire because i
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
think we we have a lot of conversations
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
back and forth about
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
what we think about that market but when
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
i look at this bill
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
i see us struggling to try and put in
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
something a little more systemic rather
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
than just scatter shot which is what we
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
have now in terms of the people who are
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
willing to invest in new technologies
 
00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:06.230 align:start position:0%
willing to invest in new technologies
sure

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
first i would say that the energy market
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire wants stability right
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
we've already seen this at the puc with
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
our utilities really demanding to have
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
consistency and stability year over year
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
with what is it that new hampshire
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
intends to do for long-term plan
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that this bill is part of
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
that goal to provide consistency and
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
stability for the energy market as we
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
ramp up into allowing more than one
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
megawatt for private projects and i say
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
allowing because the business
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
case wouldn't work otherwise
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
so really
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think the intent here is to ease us
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
into the next step in our energy
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
transition to open up to
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
large-scale renewables and a larger
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of our full energy mix in new
 
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.470 align:start position:0%
percentage of our full energy mix in new
hampshire

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
coming from local sources
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
and follow up follow up while i have the
 
00:22:59.039 --> 00:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
and follow up follow up while i have the
mic

00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
mic
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
um and and so uh
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
again we also have a conversation
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
downstream from that is if we implement
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
this then there will be perhaps costs
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the chain
 
00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:14.390 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the chain
and

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
if you could say something about
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
you think
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
having this type of competition would
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately bring costs down
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
or how it would bring costs down so that
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
people could maybe better understand
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
the intent of that portfolio
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
diversification sure
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
so big picture we talked about some
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
initial startup costs and the
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
expectation that for municipalities and
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
for consumers there would be an uptick
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
in cost in the short term
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
but over the long term we know that we
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
would then become more competitive with
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states now as as we all
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
know we're all part of the big bathtub
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
that is iso new england so
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
every state has their own energy mix and
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
every state determines uh differently
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
how that cost is transferred to the
 
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.070 align:start position:0%
how that cost is transferred to the
consumer

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
but big picture the more energy we
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
produce here in new hampshire the more
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
local energy with less transmission
 
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.230 align:start position:0%
local energy with less transmission
distance

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
distance
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
the cheaper it's going to be for
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
everyone who participates every off
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
taker so unless you are completely off
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
grid you're going to have an electric
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
bill and that electric bill is comprised
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the mix of energy that is being sent
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
to your specific
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
um let's say it's a residence your
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
specific home is receiving a mix of
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
energy and that cost
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
is sent to you based on as we've talked
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
about in other hearings the transmission
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
cost is significant when it's coming
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
from far away that transmission cost
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
could be significantly decreased when we
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
create our own new hampshire solar and
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
our own new hampshire wind
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
so this is really intended to move us
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
forward for the next 10 years and slowly
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
decrease those transmission costs as
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
well as the overall cost of energy when
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
we're seeing huge fluctuations in the
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
international market for natural gas
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we're all paying the cost for that
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
this winter even if we're not heating
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
with electricity we're still seeing our
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
electric bills go up significantly
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
because natural gas is a volatile market
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
so what we're looking to do is introduce
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
stability with
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
local solar and wind that is not so
 
00:25:17.919 --> 00:25:19.029 align:start position:0%
local solar and wind that is not so
volatile

00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
volatile
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
and based on other factors like wars and
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
shipping overseas and things like that
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
you refer to a default
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
rate energy rate
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
that the puc shall apply
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for the precise words it's
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
hard to be clerk and uh ask questions at
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
the same time uh but but uh
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
isn't that locking the uh
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
puc into something uh yeah it's a page
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
three line
 
00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:58.230 align:start position:0%
three line
16

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
16
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
18 rather
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
et cetera and isn't that locking the puc
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
into something that made the puc and his
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
judgment may decide is in fact
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to speak for the puc
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
um i think that may be a decision for
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
the puc to make but when we talk default
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
energy rate that can change that's not
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
locked in stone so
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
what it is today is not necessarily what
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay do you need a follow-up
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas is recognized
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair thanks for taking
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
my question um i'm just curious could
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
you refer to the page three
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
line three could you explain to us
 
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.990 align:start position:0%
line three could you explain to us
exactly

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
why that paragraph is there and why it's
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
important or not the version of the bill
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at doesn't have the line
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
numbers could you just read the first
 
00:26:57.919 --> 00:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
numbers could you just read the first
test

00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%

it's a sub paragraph e
 
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.669 align:start position:0%
it's a sub paragraph e
which

00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph e
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry paragraph three

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
sub-paragraph e it talks about the um

any provisions of settlement agreements
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
or orders that have been approved or

issued by the commission
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh blah blah blah uh shall not apply et
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
that paragraph there
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
could you explain why that's in there
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to read it out loud for the
 
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.070 align:start position:0%
i'm going to read it out loud for the
record

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
any provisions of settlement agreements
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
or orders that have been approved or
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
issued by the commission that relate to
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
a distribution utilities treatment of
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
the output from qualifying facilities or
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
independent power producers shall not
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%

metering

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
metering
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
so we've had some pretty long
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
discussions about what happens when
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
somebody installs solar panels on their
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
house and they decide that they don't
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
want to take advantage of the wrecks
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
and wreck sweeping is when those wrecks
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
go to the utility without any additional
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
payment to the person who installed the
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
solar so it's basically a free gift to
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
the utilities
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
what i'm seeing here is that somebody
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
gets the benefit of the net metering as
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to the wrecks which go
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
immediately to the utility so it looks
 
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.389 align:start position:0%
immediately to the utility so it looks
like

00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
qualifying facilities or independent
 
00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:24.710 align:start position:0%
qualifying facilities or independent
producers

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
will be treated differently than
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
utilities when it comes to net metering
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
so perhaps when we're talking about
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
a utility who is receiving
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
energy directly from a producer right
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
someone who's decided to do a 4.99
 
00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.389 align:start position:0%
someone who's decided to do a 4.99
megawatt

00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
huge solar array
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's going directly to the utility and
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
so they are net metering because they're
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
sending it to the utility and there's a
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
specific rate that the utility will give
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
them for producing that energy right
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
especially if it's positive net metering
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being used for their own
 
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.549 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being used for their own
use

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
but if you're doing an independent power
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
producer that would be a different rate
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
altogether because they're using it for
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
their own use rather than sending it
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
back to the to the grid for the
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
utilities use
 
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.269 align:start position:0%
utilities use
follow-up

00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
well you probably explained why
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
what that paragraph means i'm not
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
exactly sure i understand
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
why it needs to be in there but my
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned rex uh rex sweeping
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't say the word renewable
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
energy credit
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
i think that this is something that
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
could be amended to either make it very
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
clear that it's intended to be rec
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
sweeping or not
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
i think this is more about laying out
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
the ground rules for how the rate is
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
applied whether it's used locally or
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
sent back to the utility but i do think
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
that looking at rec sweeping as a layer
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
added to
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
local solar production is important
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
we've addressed it with several other
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
bills we've talked about this year i'm
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
not sure that that's an animal that i'd
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
want to add into this bill at this time
 
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
but it's something to consider
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions i have one
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
then we'll see if representative
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
bernardi and callie pitts have questions
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
could you describe how this bill differs
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:31.750 align:start position:0%
from the
three

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
net metering bills that were vetoed by
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.590 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
at this point municipal has been
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor so it doesn't
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
include municipal it's really just
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
private um so in that case we've kind of
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
split the baby right we passed municipal
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
the governor signed it it's happening
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
now and municipal's slowly ramping up i
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
think we'll actually hear from the
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
department of energy about some
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
information and data on municipal net
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
metering as the program continues to
 
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.909 align:start position:0%
metering as the program continues to
grow

00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
grow
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
but this bill is really focused on those
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
who were left behind
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
so i would say that this is half of a
 
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
bill compared to a full bill the last
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
three times the governor saw it
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
i guess the ask is
 
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
all right we've left these portions of
 
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
the industry behind let's allow them to
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
catch up let's give them the same
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
benefits that we've given our
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities and that's the difference
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and my follow-up question
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
would be i have looked at the remote
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
network service transmission tables for
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
all the new england states and i don't
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
see that new hampshire pays any increase
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
in transmission costs over the other
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
states why do you think that that
 
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.470 align:start position:0%
states why do you think that that
happens

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
or why do you think that that's true the
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
statement you made about
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire paying more in
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
so i would be careful to say that we
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
don't pay more in transmission costs
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
than the states around us i would simply
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
say that because we are receiving um
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
much of our energy not our nuclear but
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
much of our other energy from out of
 
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
state we are paying those transmission
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
costs because they're coming to us from
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so in order to reduce that we
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
would need to have local sources of
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
energy to not be paying the transmission
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
costs so it's not really a
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts maine vermont versus new
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire for transmission cost
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
comparison it is a we all get energy
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
from other places via natural gas
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
pipelines etc hydro from canada and so
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
we're paying those transmission costs
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
but we can reduce them all of us
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
individually and specifically for new
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire by having local energy that is
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
not brought from so far away
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernardi is

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
could you get a little bit closer to you
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
my question is more more fundamental uh
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
which is why is this necessary if there
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
is a desire as you've indicated for
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
individuals and businesses
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
to purchase
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
solar wind hydro power energy now
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
why why can't they find the users they
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
need and build their build their uh
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
three five
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
so that's really a question of the
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
market we certainly have developers who
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
would like to do that work in new
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire and are choosing to do it in
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
the surrounding states instead because
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
there is this additional incentive to do
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
projects up to 4.99 megawatts in the
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
states surrounding new hampshire we do
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
not have those incentives or or the
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
things that move the market
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
and so the businesses are choosing not
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
to put in their own money and take
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a loss in the short term
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
because they can make more money where
 
00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
the low hanging fruit is in the
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
surrounding states
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
so unless and until the surrounding
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
states are completely coated and covered
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
with every possible site i don't see new
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire as being an opportune location
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the same market
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
conditions as the states around us but
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
we can bypassing this bill this creates
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
that additional incentive to spin the
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
meter backwards between the one and four
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
point nine nine megawatt window and so
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is a major
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
market shift we as government actors are
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
able to change the market by passing
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
legislation to encourage a direction
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to see the market to go
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so expecting private actors in a
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
difficult condition to act that way is
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
not realistic we know that in capitalism
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
these contractors are going to select
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
the lowest hanging fruit which in this
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
case is generally massachusetts but it
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
can also be made in vermont it's
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
certainly not new hampshire for large
 
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
certainly not new hampshire for large
solar

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
solar
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
so then you're saying that we we have to
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
have these incentives or because because
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
these customers aren't out there they
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
can't find them
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
even in massachusetts or vermont or or
 
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.230 align:start position:0%
even in massachusetts or vermont or or
maine

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
so i'm talking about shifting the entire
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
market right we're we're making a major
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
change in how we
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
put energy into the new hampshire
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
market by incentivizing large solar and
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
large wind and large hydro
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
so incentivizing those is a market shift
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
that shift has already occurred in
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts maine and vermont and so
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
more and more
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
medium size to large size arrays pop up
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
in those locations because the market
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
has shifted there but not here so we are
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
in effect being left behind
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
so it's not so much that there isn't a
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
need or a desire i will tell you that i
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
personally purchased my electricity from
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
100 wind outside of my unitil contract
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
because i want to do the right thing for
 
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
the next generation and for the long
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
term but i would probably say that
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's not something that most people in
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire even consider they're
 
00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
really just looking at what is my cost
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
of electricity and is there any way i
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
can reduce it right
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about making a
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
market shift
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
the goal here is let's get more
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
homegrown electricity let's make it here
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire let's be proud of
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
something that we can do and let's
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
create that market
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not that there isn't the desire
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's simply that at such a large scale
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
you're not going to see independent
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
actors making much of a difference for a
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
pitts has a question
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
oh she pit i'll pass for now okay she
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
passes all right representative lowkey
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a parallel question
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned batteries
 
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
and before we can reduce either base
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
load or transmission then we would need
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
to have the renewables be able to store
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
enough energy to ride through whatever
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
time that might be
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we're still going to
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
just revert to base load thank you
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
um was that a question
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
are the batteries how big are the
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
batteries how long can they last
 
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.950 align:start position:0%
batteries how long can they last
sure

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
so there have been some really
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
interesting pilot studies on large-scale
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
batteries in massachusetts i believe
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is on the south shore near the cape
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
an 18-wheeler that has the big old box
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
on the back of it right that you can
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
move around
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that size
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
full of batteries
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
that can contain enough to run for two
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
or three days for you know 10 or 20
 
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.470 align:start position:0%
or three days for you know 10 or 20
houses

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
houses
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing is creating a box
 
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
with batteries that can run during a
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
complete electric shutdown for a couple
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
of days for a neighborhood
 
00:37:47.599 --> 00:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
of days for a neighborhood
and

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's not so far away right now in
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
terms of technology
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
and i certainly would like to get some
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
more information on the unh durham
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
project because i believe it's a similar
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
concept of we want to be completely
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
self-contained and able to run even if
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's a snowstorm for three days the sky
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
is gray we want to be able to draw from
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
our backup
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay follow
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking i'm just kind of trying to
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
mix take oranges and oranges so if we
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
have a 5 megawatt
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
solar facility
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
how big would the battery have to be to
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
be able to ride through several days
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
because that's a whole lot more than 20
 
00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.030 align:start position:0%
because that's a whole lot more than 20
houses

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
houses
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
sure um i i don't actually play solar
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
developer on tv
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
um so there may be some folks in this
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
room who have a little bit more
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
information than me on the actual scale
 
00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:41.910 align:start position:0%
information than me on the actual scale
but

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
that size of you know a semi-trailer
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
truck box
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
times however many are necessary to
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
provide the planned backup for the scale
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the solar i can't tell you exactly
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
whether that's a quarter acre or half
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
acre compared to the full array but
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's some math for the amount of time
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
and duration that you intend to have a
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
backup for
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
and just to spin off that question i
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
also think that here in new england we
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
are not doing ourselves any favors
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
by not doing time of use
 
00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:17.349 align:start position:0%
by not doing time of use
costing

00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
costing
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
because obviously when the solar is
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
happening in the middle of the day and
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're getting a lot of solar energy into
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
the grid that could be stored in
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
batteries that's the cheapest
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
electricity it's in the evenings when
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
everyone comes home and they're doing a
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
load of laundry and the dishes and turn
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
up the electric heat for those folks who
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
have it that's the time of use when
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's real demand
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
let's confine this discussion to the
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
bill in question thank you
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative mirner is uh recognized
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.270 align:start position:0%
for a question
yes

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
recently we just
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
there was a big scale project up in
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
littleton proposed and it was rejected
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
by the town because they just didn't
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
understand it because they were over 30
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
like what storage
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
and so representative harrington filed a
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill to make it a separate class so that
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
the set evaluation committee can
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
actually sit in you know be part of the
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
process for them to get this to get it
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
through um so i mean it's being looked
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
at and that was the first big skill when
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
i know in the state of new hampshire
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
that was filed so um
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
so it we have they are looking at it
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
because that will take that what you're
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
talking about the instability out
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm going to suggest at this
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
point that we move on we have three more
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
people signed up to testify on this bill
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
we're down to our last 22 minutes or so
 
00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams has done an
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
outstanding job of explaining what the
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill does how it manipulates the market
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
etc so let's move on and i'd like to uh
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mick williams
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call on
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
mark brown of the consumer energy
 
00:40:52.640 --> 00:41:09.190 align:start position:0%
mark brown of the consumer energy
alliance

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
good morning mr brown it's all yours
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
good good to be back before the
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
committee in person
 
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.309 align:start position:0%
committee in person
um

00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
chairman vo's members of the committee
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is mark brown
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
i am the executive director of new
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
england for consumer energy alliance
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
cea is a nationwide association made up
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
of both energy producers and consumers
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
working to advance in all the above
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
energy and environmental policies that
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
will lower energy costs for everyone
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
cea supports actions that thoughtfully
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
advance our nation toward a cleaner more
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
environmentally responsible energy
 
00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.190 align:start position:0%
environmentally responsible energy
future

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
while also considering the needs of
 
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.150 align:start position:0%
while also considering the needs of
consumers

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of cea i want to thank for
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify here today
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
cea supports new hampshire families
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities businesses making
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
investments in generation that will
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
allow them to produce their own power
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
and sell that power back to the grid
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
there is no legislative or regulatory
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
hurdle prohibiting this from happening
 
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.589 align:start position:0%
hurdle prohibiting this from happening
now

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
um as is always the case with these
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
bills the issue is at what
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
compensation you know for systems one to
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
five megawatts
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
purple requires utilities to purchase
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
their power at avoided cost so there you
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
know there is a market there for that
 
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.870 align:start position:0%
know there is a market there for that
now

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
um so i just want to just touch on that
 
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.829 align:start position:0%
um so i just want to just touch on that
now

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:24.950 align:start position:0%
now
um

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
the other thing i want to talk about is
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
you often hear about um and i think
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative williams brought it up is
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
about this transmission cost savings
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
um i passed around
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
a sheet there and it's not it shouldn't
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
be seen as anything that's you know
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
totally conclusive um
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot that goes into
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the it's a 12 month
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
rolling average of you know regional
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
load okay and this goes month to month
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
and it's from december of 2014 through
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
december 2021.
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
um you can't see it on the on the on the
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
graph that i sent out but if you look at
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
let's start at the top with
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts you know you go all the
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
way to the left in december 14
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
their allocation was 46.2 percent of the
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know of regional transmission
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
by december 21 you know it's 45.7 so
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the transmission market is
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
about two it's about a two billion
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
dollar market
 
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:20.710 align:start position:0%
dollar market
so

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
each tenth of a percentage point
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
represents two million dollars okay so
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
in theory massachusetts would be saving
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh 10 million dollars in annual
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
transmission costs right if you look at
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
connecticut starts out at 25.3 and goes
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
down to 24.4
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire 9.4 and goes up to 9.7
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
now again this isn't meant to be you
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
know definitive or absolute or anything
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
like that but it's pretty clear that
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
you know massachusetts has spent
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
literally in that time frame tens of
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars on behind the meter
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
and energy efficiency and things to you
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
know reduce load
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
um and they haven't really substantially
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
reduced their transmission costs
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
um during that time frame so i think
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's you know i think this somewhat
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
illustrative of what might happen
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
um or what is happening
 
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.150 align:start position:0%
um or what is happening
probably

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.190 align:start position:0%
probably
um

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not i've sat before this
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
committee before and i've talked about
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
studies and i'm happy to provide the
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee with any studies that i
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
reference today and but there's there's
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
plenty of studies out there that show
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
that net metering policies are socially
 
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.309 align:start position:0%
that net metering policies are socially
regressive

00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
regressive
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
that non-adopters pay for more of the
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know the distribution system
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
than solar doctors do
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
solar doctors tend to be more wealthy
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
than non-solar adopters you know 2021
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
lawrence berkeley lab study
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think the average median income for a
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
typical solar owner was
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
113 thousand dollars where i think the
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
u.s averages around
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
000 so that's pretty substantial
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
difference that has come down i think in
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
2010 the average solar owner had an
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
income of about 140 median income about
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
140 000
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
um so we know we know it's it's pretty
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
socially regressive
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know massachusetts has
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
puts into its tariffs you know
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
low-income adders
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
to offset the costs in massachusetts of
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
the behind the meter
 
00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.790 align:start position:0%
the behind the meter
systems

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's probably exceeding over 100
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars now
 
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.829 align:start position:0%
million dollars now
um

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i want to talk about a few things
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
about market so this would this would
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
create a you know this would compensate
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
systems at one to five megawatts at the
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
default service rate which we know is
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
well above market rates even with
 
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:35.349 align:start position:0%
well above market rates even with
um

00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
you know the price of natural gas on the
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
rise right now
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
we've passed legislation
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
for community you know for community
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
power community choice aggregation
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
however you want to look at it that
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
should create a market for larger
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
systems you know more towns adopting
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know increasing you know green
 
00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.589 align:start position:0%
you know increasing you know green
programs

00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
more net zero more 100 percent renewable
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
that should develop the market for these
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
size for these size systems
 
00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:02.790 align:start position:0%
size for these size systems
um

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
as far as you know
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
again kind of flipping back to
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
transmission costs you know new
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
we are part of a regional grid as
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative williams stated
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
but if you look at it strictly from you
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
know energy produced and energy consumed
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
electricity produced in energy consumed
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
as far as in terms of megawatt hours
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
well the new hampshire would be
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
considered actually an exporter of
 
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.630 align:start position:0%
considered actually an exporter of
energy

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
so you know between the the nuclear
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
plants between granite ridge and
 
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.190 align:start position:0%
plants between granite ridge and
londonderry

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
londonderry
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
between you know the hydros and the and
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
the wind and then and the solar
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
we produce more electricity in the state
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
than we actually consume
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
so you know i think
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
i think with that i guess i'll just
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony i'll be happy to
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.910 align:start position:0%
take any questions
um

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
and again if anybody wants to i'll be
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
happy to afford any studies
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
um they're you know mit stanford cal
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
berkeley um pretty conclusive studies
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
that show that
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
expanding that metering is
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
socially regressive so
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr brown representative plett
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question mr brown you say
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're a net exporter of energy
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
would installing more
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
net metering local facilities increase
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
that net export and therefore increase
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
the need for transmission
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
i mean that that's depending on what
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
other states do and you i mean
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's complicated right it's not
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's not that simple um it depends on
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
i guess what i would say is
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
the more
 
00:47:48.319 --> 00:47:50.230 align:start position:0%
the more
we

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
incentivize you know through state
 
00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:53.910 align:start position:0%
incentivize you know through state
policies

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
other resources
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
creates price suppression on existing
 
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.589 align:start position:0%
creates price suppression on existing
resources

00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
like nuclear plants that rely heavily on
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
energy market revenue not capacity
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
market revenue
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
and you know it would potentially put
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
those plants at risk i know you know
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
when vermont when vermont yankee retired
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
in i think it was 2014 2015 there are a
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
host of reasons why it retired but one
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
of the reasons they gave was they were
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about what was going to happen
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
with energy markets down the road and
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
potential price suppression effects and
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
thus their revenue
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
from state policies
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
immediately after that emissions rose i
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
think it was seven percent in the next
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
year after they retired so
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think there's a kind of a bigger
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
picture here and i know i didn't fully
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
answer your question but i think it's
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
more complicated than just saying if we
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
if we install a bunch of five megawatt
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
systems in new hampshire well then we're
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to create you know transmission
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
problems it could
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know it could especially if let's
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
say seabrook were to retire
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
well now you're really moving power
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
you know from other areas you know into
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we already know there's
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
congestion constraints on the mass
 
00:49:05.589 --> 00:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me on the main new hampshire
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
border so even if you bring hydro in
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
from canada through maine
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
there's got to be infrastructure
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
built to carry that power into new
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire so it's more complicated than
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
just a i think a yes or no follow-up
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes um there's been testimony
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
about desirability of
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
local generation
 
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.270 align:start position:0%
local generation
um

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
i gave testimony the other day about a
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
situation in my town
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh trash to energy people hated the idea
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
but it was okay in maine so we shipped
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
our trash to maine
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
is it is it uh
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
is so is it the eye of the beholder
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
whether local generation is desirable or
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
not yeah and i think that applies to any
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
any resource it doesn't matter you know
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
you're seeing
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
solar projects rejected in towns like
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
northampton massachusetts they don't
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
want to see any you know large-scale
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
solar projects so you're seeing it in
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
maine um i think level main is the town
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
um you know we've seen it with wind
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen it with transmission lines
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
there you call it nimbyism call it
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
whatever you want but yeah there's gonna
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's probably gonna be opposition to
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know to anything
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative knotter is recognized
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
taking the question mr brown good to see
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
you again good to see you um i keep
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
hearing the word incentivize but what do
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
you mean exactly by that does it mean
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
redistribution of wealth
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
well i think i do believe you know that
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
net metering is regressive so yes it is
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
i do believe it generally favors the the
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
more wealthy at the expense of those
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
less fortunate um and i think that the
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
evidence shows that
 
00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.670 align:start position:0%
evidence shows that
um

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
and as far as incentives go you know
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
would incentivize it would make payments
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
to systems from one up to you know 4.999
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
megawatts to avoid further jurisdiction
 
00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:57.829 align:start position:0%
megawatts to avoid further jurisdiction
um

00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
above market rates
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
so that's you know
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
and above the the
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
prescribed avoid cost rate which in new
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire is pretty much the lmp so
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.710 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
question

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
brown for taking my question
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
um it's an interesting conversation
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're having and it always comes down to
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know which points we're being
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
asked to look at
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
in your graph here it's a rolling
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
average of regional load and i guess my
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
initial question i have to
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
is regional load
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
based on uh
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
populations and industry that the state
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
serves based on peak it's based on
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
monthly peaks those are monthly peaks
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
and those peaks are not related to
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
the population use no it's transmission
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
peaks just transmission yeah okay
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
all right and then the second thing is
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
the point on socially uh regressive i
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
think you know
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
i think that the bill in looking at
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
diversity is saying we don't have a plan
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire right we don't
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
have an understanding of where we're
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
going in terms of
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
seabrook and you know so all of this is
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
speculation in terms of what is the mix
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
going to be in 10 years we don't have a
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
plan that tells us where we're going
 
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.870 align:start position:0%
plan that tells us where we're going
and

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
i think on the question of socially
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
regressive that you were trying to make
 
00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:23.430 align:start position:0%
regressive that you were trying to make
um

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it it's not
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
socially regressive if you are trying to
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
take into account
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
the climate effects that
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect the poor
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
it is looking at what is socially
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
regressive in terms of our energy
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
decisions to try and
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
put policies in place that help prevent
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
those in the lower income rungs from
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
being affected by the decisions we're
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
making today on our energy
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay well those are you know probably
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to quantify
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
um i would say you know from an
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
emissions perspective especially with
 
00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:59.270 align:start position:0%
emissions perspective especially with
co2

00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
co2
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
one new hampshire has the lowest
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
emissions per megawatt hour produced in
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
the region largely due to seabrook yep
 
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.990 align:start position:0%
you know
but

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's a fact nonetheless
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
the u.s itself has reduced emissions by
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
about 17 percent between 2005 and 2019
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
so we're kind of leading the world in
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
that area
 
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.549 align:start position:0%
that area
um

00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're exporting emissions to some extent
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
to other countries that are less
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
environmentally responsible than we are
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
so i would say you know there's
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
trade-offs to any policy
 
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.309 align:start position:0%
trade-offs to any policy
um

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
when i talk about socially regressive
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know you look at a lot of the
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
studies have been done in states that
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
have far more advanced you know
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
renewable energy policies in new
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire massachusetts
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
california obviously a lot of studies
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
have been done there
 
00:53:45.599 --> 00:53:47.990 align:start position:0%
have been done there
illinois

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
illinois
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
but it does show significant cost shifts
 
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.549 align:start position:0%
but it does show significant cost shifts
from

00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
generally solar adopters to non-solar
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
adopters and we've seen you know as as
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the case with california they're
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
importing a lot of power from arizona
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
which is heavily dependent on coal
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
they're building new gas plants to you
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
know the la county is building a new gas
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
plant to support its municipal system
 
00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:11.349 align:start position:0%
plant to support its municipal system
because

00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
the reliability there so there's a lot
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
of trade-offs so i would just say that
 
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.470 align:start position:0%
of trade-offs so i would just say that
uh

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah there may be benefits on this end
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
and there's definitely benefits to the
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
recipient of the net metering program
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of other factors that
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
you need to look at as well
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
so and there's some evidence to show
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
that it's it's not good for everybody
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsich is
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony mr brown
 
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.829 align:start position:0%
your testimony mr brown
um

00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of surprised by some of your
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
your comments uh because we have had
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
numerous testimony and
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
documents provided to us by des
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
here at this committee over the past two
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
or three years
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
who have consistently said
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
that transmission costs are rising
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
compared to the other neighboring states
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
they've said this over and over again
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
they've documented it it's in our
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
four-year energy strategy plan are you
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
saying that they're wrong
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that if you pick an arbitrary
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
beginning point then you can come up
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
with any you know you can kind of show
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
anything you want to show and what i
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
would say is
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
it's not just about the it shouldn't be
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
looked at as just the transmission cost
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
what did it cost to reduce those
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
those transmission numbers
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
you know again massachusetts to spend
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
tens of billions of dollars
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
tens of billions of dollars on
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
distributed generation energy efficiency
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
to move the needle slightly
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
so you know just saying that oh well you
 
00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:50.309 align:start position:0%
so you know just saying that oh well you
know

00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
our car our our share of the regional
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
network load is up a little bit or even
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
if it's up a full point
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay well if massachusetts is
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
spending more money than it is saving
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't make a lot of sense to
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh and um you know we're talking about
 
00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:10.950 align:start position:0%
uh and um you know we're talking about
the

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.309 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
future perspective of energy supply in
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
how do you see the impact of the
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry which probably
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
will be impacting us within the next 10
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
years on the energy prices that people
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire will be paying or new
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
england for that matter
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
offshore wind is promising but you know
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
it needs to provide benefits to the
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
consumer as well and if those contracts
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
are for you know firm power at
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable rates great
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know but if you know if it's going
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
to be for intermittent power where
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're managing risk and and all that
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and it increased costs on
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
i think it the the proof is in the
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
pudding is there is there potential an
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
offshore win absolutely i'm not going to
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
argue that with you at all
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
but i do think it a lot depends on how
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
the contracts are structured
 
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
the contracts are structured
and

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know obviously how the projects are
 
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.990 align:start position:0%
you know obviously how the projects are
developed

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
and what capacity factors those
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
projects are going to have
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's all things that are going to
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
matter but i'm i'm not going to argue
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the potential benefits of offshore
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
wind with you here
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you representative
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
bernardi is recognized for a question
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you uh mr brown
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh as you've noted uh
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
net metering incentives means increased
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
cost to the consumers
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh do you have an estimate
 
00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:36.630 align:start position:0%
uh do you have an estimate
uh

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
for this bill what where what what kind
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
of increased costs we'd be looking at i
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i could
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
sit down and do some back of the
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
envelope math but no and i think this
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
actually you bring up a good point
 
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.030 align:start position:0%
actually you bring up a good point
because

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
doe i guess now is you know
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for a study
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
to be completed that has been part of an
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
ongoing docket at the puc you know
 
00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
the net metering tariff talk at the
 
00:58:02.319 --> 00:58:04.470 align:start position:0%
the net metering tariff talk at the
16-576

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
16-576
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a study that's going to be
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
coming out of that i think it's supposed
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
to be late spring
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i think it would do do us all good
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
to put pause on some of these net
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
metering bills to wait to see
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
what that study shows it may not again
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's not probably going to be conclusive
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be you know probably
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
oh yeah you have to do this or or
 
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.349 align:start position:0%
oh yeah you have to do this or or
whatever

00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
but it should provide us with more
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
information as to what the impact of net
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
metering is on new hampshire right now
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
and will better inform us down the road
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
on policies again
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
some of us may agree or disagree with
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the study shows but at least
 
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have more information to go by
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
okay thank you with that i'm going to
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
call on the
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to thank mr brown for his very
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
informative testimony and call on the
 
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.069 align:start position:0%
informative testimony and call on the
next

00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh presenter who will be
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
our good friend griffin roberge from the
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.430 align:start position:0%
by the way
uh

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
we're running out of time
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
that was allocated for this public
 
00:59:09.839 --> 00:59:10.870 align:start position:0%
that was allocated for this public
hearing

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
so i will be
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
starting the next public hearing
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
properly at ten o'clock and then
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
recessing it
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
until we finish this public hearing
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
so mr robarge
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's all yours thank you chairman votes
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%

it's largely for

two reasons that have been discussed

just said moments ago
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
the department is currently working on
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
it with a consultant to study issues
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%

that study is
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
meant to provide policy makers state
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
agencies as well as other stakeholders
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
some type of guidance as to the value of
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
these resources there that is new
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire centric and using new
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire-centric data
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
it is part of an ongoing puc docket and
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
again for reference it's de
 
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.670 align:start position:0%
again for reference it's de
16-576

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
and it is expected that that study will
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
be completed in late spring of this year
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
the department just thinks that this
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
bill is premature at this time pending
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that study
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
while um
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
this bill would largely expand net
 
01:00:34.079 --> 01:00:35.349 align:start position:0%
this bill would largely expand net
metering

01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
metering
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know to the extent that there may or
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
may not be cost shifting this bill would
 
01:00:39.359 --> 01:00:40.549 align:start position:0%
may not be cost shifting this bill would
likely

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
likely
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
exaggerate that i think the department
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
would like to see what the study has to
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately finds
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
in that direction
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
as i know the committee is certainly
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
well aware
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
315 was signed into law last year
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
along with
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
other language in senate bill 91
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
that had a very targeted and modest
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
increase beyond the one megawatt net
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
metering cap for municipal hosts it
 
01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:10.710 align:start position:0%
metering cap for municipal hosts it
allows

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
public private entities to net meter for
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
the benefit of political subdivision or
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
i should say group net meter for the
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
benefit of political subdivisions
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
to date there are currently four
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
municipal hosts in the state registered
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
there's one in their all all four
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facilities but they're
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
located in milton
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
berlin gorham and hillsborough i
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't give any ideas to what type of
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
applications might come in the future
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
but that's currently uh what is in
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
operation for municipal hosts in the
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
state uh certainly we'll only answer any
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
 
01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:47.589 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
um

01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony
 
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh excellent testimony on this bill
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions for mr roberge representative
 
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.549 align:start position:0%
questions for mr roberge representative
samsich

01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
samsich
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that we've had
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
several documents and testimonies from
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
puc as well as from other agencies who
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
said that in light of our very low
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
penetration of renewable energy in this
 
01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.829 align:start position:0%
penetration of renewable energy in this
state

01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
there is no observable cost shifting
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
that we could see up to this point
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
would you agree with that i believe that
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
there was and it
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
put me on the spot i can't remember the
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
docket number or the the document or
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
anything like that right now but i think
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
there was some years ago there was a
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion that there wasn't any
 
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
noticeable effect of cost shifting based
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
on the data at that time and i believe
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
three four years ago or something like
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
that again doing this all from memory
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll certainly follow it by email
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
factors certainly change over time
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's for certain um and so that's why
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh the department would respectfully
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
like to request
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
further study on this issue with
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
this study that's expected out in late
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
spring to get further information as to
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
the true value of these distributed
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
energy resources and its impact on the
 
01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:07.589 align:start position:0%
energy resources and its impact on the
state

01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:07.599 --> 01:03:09.029 align:start position:0%
state
follow-up

01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:10.549 align:start position:0%
follow-up
yes

01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
could you do you have any ideas i i
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
agree with you i think it was three or
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
four years ago that we heard this
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
well how much
 
01:03:21.029 --> 01:03:21.039 align:start position:0%
what what kind of increase have we seen
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
in renewable energy since that three
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
four years since then sure so that would
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
make a difference perhaps obviously
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
there is the renewable portfolio
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
standard that's the state's renewable
 
01:03:31.039 --> 01:03:31.990 align:start position:0%
standard that's the state's renewable
energy

01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
policy tool that encourages the
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
or i should say incentivizes and
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
encourages the development of renewable
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
energies in the state every year that
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
goes by
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
various class obligations increase over
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
time so off the top of my head that's
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
certainly one that encourages the
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
further development of renewable energy
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
resources in the state
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
obviously there was the passage of the
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
municipal host bill last year that's
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
obviously encouraged at least four
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
projects to come online and group net
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
meter for the benefit of municipalities
 
01:04:03.109 --> 01:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
and their local property taxpayers um i
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't offer anything substantial but
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of renewable energy
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's expansion i'm sure it
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
will likely be discussed in the study
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
that comes out later this year excuse me
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
that was not my question i asked you
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
how much has changed in the last three
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
or four years you were saying there are
 
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
all these incentives in place to do
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
things but i wanted to know how much has
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
changed since then to change the opinion
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
maybe of what we heard three years ago
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
oh of the study um you know obviously
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
there's been a targeted increase with
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
municipal hosts again as i said
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
certainly market factors are also a
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
thing to take into consideration i
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't comment substantially you know
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not involved uh intricately in the
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
study and what it's currently looking at
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
i can certainly you know try to get you
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
a more concrete answer and follow up
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
with you
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
we do know that install solar has
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
doubled in that time period
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a quick pause here and
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open the public hearing on
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then i'm going to recess that public
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
hearing until we complete this public
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
hearing which hopefully won't take too
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
much longer
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
more questions for mr roberge
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
all right cam rich mr uh robert if i as
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
a private citizen
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to put up
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
a 4.99 megawatt solar array
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
and had to connect that array
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
who would pick up
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
or would it be the company
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
or would it be split
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
how would that be funded
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
if private entity were to construct a
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
system in excess of one megawatt um
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know i i mean obviously the cost
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
will be borne by that private entity
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
obviously installing the system and all
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
of its relevant aspects in terms of
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
upgrading you know a distribution system
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
or transmission system
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
i'd have to do a deeper dive but i
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
anticipate that those costs would
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
likely be
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
imposed upon
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
the utility which would then be shared
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
amongst its ratepayers for probably cost
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
recovery but again like to do a deeper
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
dive and not lead you astray with an
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
incorrect answer
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
i i'm having a hard time hearing you so
 
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.029 align:start position:0%
i i'm having a hard time hearing you so
that's

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:06:39.039 --> 01:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
that's
um

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns and i don't know if
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
the department of energy would look into
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%

cross

01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
areas

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
areas

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
most of the cost is borne by
 
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.670 align:start position:0%
most of the cost is borne by
ratepayers

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps

01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
more people
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
would be more interested in selling
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
electricity than tomatoes
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:25.839 align:start position:0%
sure i understand you're i i guess
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
people would be further incentivized to
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
sell electricity rather than sell
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
tomatoes using your analogy
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
your or your references yes and that
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
electricity if it goes out onto the grid
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
can go anywhere it doesn't have to stay
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
what i understand in new hampshire no
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
and and that's true but obviously if
 
01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.470 align:start position:0%
and and that's true but obviously if
people

01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
net meter it tends to be
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of those largely in the
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
surrounding area as i think you're well
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
aware you know the longer
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
the longer
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
in distance electricity needs to travel
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any further questions
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized yes
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
robash for taking my question
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
um i i'm
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
going to refer back to what you said in
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
your opening you talked about the fact
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
that the doe is opposed to the bill
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
specifically because there's a pending
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
value of der study going on at the
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
relatively newly formed doe and then you
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there was also a dock
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
that opened at the puc
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
that starts with de16 can you explain to
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
people what that 16 stands for i'm sorry
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
16 references um the year that the
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
docket was created and so so it's it's
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
six years that we've been waiting for
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
that that would work yes thank you for
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
the clarification yeah so i just wanted
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
to say that for some of us that have
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
been you know working in this field for
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
a while while we're asking questions
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
right right well while you're saying
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
that it's premature i guess i would
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
i would suggest to you that we've been
 
01:09:01.990 --> 01:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
waiting a really long time for someone
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
to give us a definitive answer
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
and so
um

01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
pending study of the value of der that's
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
going on at doe could you give us an
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
anticipated time frame for when we might
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
be seeing those results yeah late spring
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
of this year um
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah that's it that's at least outlined
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note that's the
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
anticipated um
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
anticipated conclusion of the study
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%

when we were having deliberations on
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 15 and senate bill 91
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
and this language essentially says
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
that if you are a customer generator
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
of renewable energy
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
that engages in net energy media
 
01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.629 align:start position:0%
that engages in net energy media
metering

01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
metering
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot be
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
paid for renewable portfolio standard
 
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.669 align:start position:0%
paid for renewable portfolio standard
charges

01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
charges
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
you cannot be credited rather for
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
standard charges
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
when you are credited for your net
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
metering supply to the grid
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly simple change and
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
the language may be
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
puc speak
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
as they call it
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
but it uh does one simple thing and it
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
just says that
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
if you are a net energy meter
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
you need to pay
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
your poor your fair share of rps charges
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
and can't receive credits for those
 
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.270 align:start position:0%
and can't receive credits for those
charges

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
charges
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's no more complicated than that
 
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:16.390 align:start position:0%
it's no more complicated than that
and

01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't require a lot of explanation
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
i'll open the floor to questions and
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative um mcgee you're uh
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you mr
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
acting chairman uh and thank you
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
chairman bose for taking my question
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
um i guess my question would be how
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
would this affect the existing
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
it would lower the credit that any net
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
metering customer currently gets they
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
currently get the default service rate
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
it would essentially subtract from that
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
credit default service credit the cost
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
of compliance with the rps okay and may
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up and to what end
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
require that net metering customers pay
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
their fair share of the renewable
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
if they're given a credit
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
when they
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
for their rps portion
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
then they are essentially not paying
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
for their portion of the rps
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
that would shift costs onto the rest of
 
01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:34.790 align:start position:0%
that would shift costs onto the rest of
us

01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
i only get two questions right
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
so far
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative sausage you're recognized
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
for a question with a queue
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh representatives um can you clarify
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
for me again
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
is currently what what is the current
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
practice if if you are a customer
 
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.430 align:start position:0%
practice if if you are a customer
generator

01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
generator
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
and net metering so you get credit
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
for your the energy you put into the
 
01:23:00.159 --> 01:23:01.110 align:start position:0%
for your the energy you put into the
grid

01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
grid
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
and you're saying that that portion on
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
your electric bill
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is assigned to the rps
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
you don't pay that is that the current
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
no i s what i said was that if this bill
 
01:23:17.679 --> 01:23:18.870 align:start position:0%
no i s what i said was that if this bill
passed

01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:20.719 align:start position:0%
the practice would change
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
current practice is yes
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm asking what is the
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
current practice yes
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
if you generate
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
more than 100 kilowatts of electricity
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
and you net meter
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
you get default service credits
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
energy that you put onto the grid the
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
default service credit includes the cost
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the rps that the utility
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
i see that's included in the defaults
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions i thank
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative votes for your very
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%

i am today submitting a written
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
testimony which i submitted
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
electronically this morning in
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to host bill 1599 my reasons
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
for opposing the bill are as follows and
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
these reasons are what you've heard on
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
the previous bill today
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
one is that the bill changes the basis
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
for compensation for new customer
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
generators within a total peak
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
generating capacity of greater than one
 
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.030 align:start position:0%
generating capacity of greater than one
megawatt

01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
the bill states the commission order uh
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
26029 from june 23
 
01:25:32.239 --> 01:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
26029 from june 23
2017

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
2017
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
shall be applicable except for the cost
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
of compliance with the electrical
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and a few
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
words after that uh just a little bit of
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
history in june of 2017 the puc
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
established the current net metering
 
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.070 align:start position:0%
established the current net metering
tariffs

01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
tariffs
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
in those tariffs the puc established its
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
view that the new tariffs avoided any
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
significant cost shifting among in
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
between customer rate classes
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
rate classes
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
currently the puc is studying the value
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
of distributed energy resources a
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
program called referred to as a vder
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
and would be expected to make any
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
adjustments to the net metering credit
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
tariffs if necessary to avoid cost
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
shifting between customer classes
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
given the current schedule for issuing
 
01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
his report on vder now scheduled for the
 
01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
spring of this year
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation should wait this
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislation should wait for the puc to
 
01:26:23.110 --> 01:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
issue its report and recommendations
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
before developing any new legislation in
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
this area
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
unilaterally adjusting
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
the various components of credits or
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
debits for nate metering net metering
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
customer generators without the benefit
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
of the com upcoming vdr study
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate and cannot properly
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
evaluate the benefits and costs of net
 
01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.590 align:start position:0%
evaluate the benefits and costs of net
metering

01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
metering
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
let the puc proceed on developing the
 
01:26:46.709 --> 01:26:46.719 align:start position:0%
vder study and then act on the
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
conclusions of the study as necessary
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
this building this bill
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
is unnecessary and premature it should
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
be determined to be an expedient to
 
01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.870 align:start position:0%
be determined to be an expedient to
legislate

01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
you know prepare to take questions
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr kwoznick uh
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative plet's recognized for a
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you i'm asking this
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
question is clerk would you please spell
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
out pter
 
01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
out pter
um

01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
vder is called the value
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
of distributed energy resources in my
 
01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
of distributed energy resources in my
apologies

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.310 --> 01:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't
 
01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:26.270 align:start position:0%
i don't envy your position at all
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:28.629 align:start position:0%
i don't envy your position at all
[Laughter]

01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing no questions uh thank you
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
mr kwasnik for your testimony appreciate
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
it and you said that the written
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
testimony was it was emailed to us it
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
was easy okay very good thank you so
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
next i'd like to call up
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
for real this time
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
mr sam evans welcome thank you so much
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire has been
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
engaged in
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
the the various proceedings at the
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission that set the
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
net metering rates
 
01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.110 align:start position:0%
net metering rates
for

01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
for years now
 
01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:26.470 align:start position:0%
for years now
and

01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:27.430 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
we recognize the principle that this
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
bill is based on um and it's it's sound
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
in principle
 
01:28:39.990 --> 01:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
but the issue is that it's looking
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
simply at one side of the ledger right
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
so so net metering um
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
i think even its most
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
resolute proponents
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
would recognize that net metering is is
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
a is a policy that gives rough justice
 
01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:55.350 align:start position:0%
a is a policy that gives rough justice
to

01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources it was not
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
a policy that was designed
 
01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.030 align:start position:0%
a policy that was designed
terribly

01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
terribly
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
conscientiously or thinking about uh the
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
markets the market structures that it
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
was playing into it was simply the
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
easiest way to roll out distributed
 
01:29:10.390 --> 01:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
energy at a time decades ago in which we
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
did not have a terribly uh
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
great number of options technologically
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
speaking to integrate those resources
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
into the grid but also it was
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing that these technologies were
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
in were sort of an
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
infant stage and we didn't necessarily
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
need a terribly
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh well-developed policy at that time we
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
just we just needed to try some things
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
and as that policy has developed and
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
changed over the course of years
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
we have we have recognized that we
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
should be developing market structures
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
that are more reflective of the cost and
 
01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.149 align:start position:0%
that are more reflective of the cost and
benefits

01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
of these types of technologies that are
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
that are deployed at the edge of the
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
grid on the distribution grid which is
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the way that the grid is designed
 
01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
today is is not typically where
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
generation resources have been deployed
 
01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.950 align:start position:0%
generation resources have been deployed
traditionally

01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
that said
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the problem with this bill and the
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
reason why clean energy new hampshire
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
opposes it is that it's is looking at
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
just one
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
aspect of this really complicated
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
question of what are the costs and
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
benefits of deploying generation
 
01:30:12.159 --> 01:30:13.510 align:start position:0%
benefits of deploying generation
resources

01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
in a system that wasn't necessarily
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
designed for them to be deployed in
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
those places and there are benefits uh
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's they're numerous we could look
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
at the reduction in the the amount that
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
our our distribution utilities have to
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
pay into the regional capacity markets
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
we've talked already this morning about
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
the amounts that the utilities pay for
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
their demand their their transmission
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
charges um and there are more and if you
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
were if any of the representatives here
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
were interested we could walk through
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
the value of distributed energy
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
resources study that's underway which is
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive and is in fact
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
looking at all of these questions um and
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
so so i would say simply that uh there
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
is a process underway that is that is
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
looking at these questions in a really
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
fulsome manner and there's no need for
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature to weigh in at this time
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
because that process is playing out at
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission and it
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
will look at questions like the one that
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses so with that i'll
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
yes representative kelly pitts
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
study is released
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission will
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
take efforts to change the formula it is
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding that that is that that
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
is how how things will go and then it
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
will likely happen through a
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
an officially adjudicated docket that
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
goes through the entire formal puc
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
process um and all the parties will be
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to weigh in on the evidence
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's presented
 
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.110 align:start position:0%
that's presented
oh

01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
will that be
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
i know you can't speak for the puc but
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
will that daca take
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
as long as what
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
you know predicting what happens at the
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
poc i think is a bit like predicting
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
what will happen at the u.s supreme
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
court uh and so i will decline to make a
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
prediction in that regard i would say
 
01:32:13.830 --> 01:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
that it was my personal hope uh that it
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
would it would be more expeditious than
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
than what has you know
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
to to to just take one step back the the
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
net metering docket is uh one of the
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
most complex and longest running dockets
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
at the new hampshire public utilities
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
commission most dockets do not take that
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
long so i would hope that it would be
 
01:32:35.199 --> 01:32:37.030 align:start position:0%
long so i would hope that it would be
faster

01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
faster
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
well although it i
 
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
someone who who is more in the pvc
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
process than me could answer this it may
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
actually take place as part of that
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
docket in fact i actually believe that
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm speaking out of turn i'm not
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
actually 100 certain about that thank
 
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
actually 100 certain about that thank
you

01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
represent cali pitch question
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative mcgee excuse me
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
i will paraphrase what i think you're
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
saying which is that the solution that's
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
being proposed by this bill
 
01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.149 align:start position:0%
being proposed by this bill
is

01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:33:12.159 --> 01:33:13.270 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
is making assumptions that we don't yet
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
have the answers to because there's
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
pending work being done on some very
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
complex calculations that would give us
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of whether we
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
should do it or not
 
01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:25.910 align:start position:0%
should do it or not
um

01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
i i would i would nuance the my answers
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
slightly and say i think that the the
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
cost of renewable portfolio compliance
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
is is actually a fairly
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
well established and and understandable
 
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
number that that one could one could
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
proceed with um with this bill what i
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
would say though is that it's it's only
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
one small part of what goes into the net
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
metering tariff and considering it in
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
isolation increasing it or reducing it
 
01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.390 align:start position:0%
isolation increasing it or reducing it
um

01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
is is really i think to not doing
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
justice to to the complex task that is
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
rate making and that we should let the
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
puc do what it does which is m make
 
01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:04.470 align:start position:0%
puc do what it does which is m make
rates

01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative platt
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
yes given the answer you just gave
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
could this bill go ahead
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
be implemented and then the puc adjusts
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
what it otherwise might have done as a
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
result of the study that's going to be
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
i i believe
 
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.669 align:start position:0%
i i believe
that

01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
that certainly it's up to the discretion
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
of this chamber as to what it's going to
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
do uh i i'm not suggesting that it is uh
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
not within the authority of the house of
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
representatives to to weigh in on this
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
question i'm simply suggesting that
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't strike me as a terribly sound
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
way to make public policy to be to be uh
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing the types of ways
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
that the general court intervenes in
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
utility rate making and uh and that
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
there is a process ongoing and so it
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
strikes me that this bill is unnecessary
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you for
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
the chair will call up um
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
heidi cole and madeline minnow from
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming this morning good
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
heidi kroll i work at gallagher callahan
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
and gartrell and i represent
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
granite state hydropower association
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
with me here today is madeline minnow
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
now working with essex hydro which is a
 
01:35:48.149 --> 01:35:48.159 align:start position:0%
member of granite state hydropower
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
association so
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
she and i are here to answer questions
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate your time this morning
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think our testimony is probably going
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
to sound similar to the testimony you've
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
just heard from
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire we are
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
urging or requesting that this committee
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
find this bill in expedient to legislate
 
01:36:08.239 --> 01:36:09.430 align:start position:0%
find this bill in expedient to legislate
and

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
again recognizing the principle that's
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
being discussed here um but asking that
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
you please kind of pause and look at the
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
context that we currently find ourselves
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
in so first as you've heard
 
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
the puc is nearing the end of a lengthy
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
and in-depth process to study the value
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
of distributed energy resources and it
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
began in the summer of i believe it was
 
01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.189 align:start position:0%
began in the summer of i believe it was
2017

01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
2017
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
following a docket
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
an order in a docket de16576
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
and that docket actually was open
 
01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
pursuant to passage of a bill in 2016
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
which was house bill 1116
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
relative to net metering and so all the
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
parties in that docket including the
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
utilities the consumer advocates
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
renewable advocates the office of energy
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
and planning at the time all agreed to
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
the adoption of alternative net metering
 
01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.189 align:start position:0%
the adoption of alternative net metering
tariffs

01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
tariffs
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
to be in effect during the period of
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
time during which data would be
 
01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:03.910 align:start position:0%
time during which data would be
collected

01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
collected
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
pilot programs would be implemented
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
studies would be conducted and so there
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
was consensus around that
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
and obviously for the past five or so
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
years the
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
puc and now the department of energy
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
staff and a diverse group of
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders have really invested a
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time and effort
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
and money
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
consultants have been hired to undertake
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
the research and the analysis
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
needed to better understand the value of
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources and so as
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
you've heard that study will expect
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
expected to be completed in late spring
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
um and so we would simply ask you not to
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
kind of do an end run around the study
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
process which was carefully designed and
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
agreed to
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
by a broad group of stakeholders
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
the second piece of that was that
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
as part of that
 
01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.510 align:start position:0%
as part of that
the

01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
parties all agreed that at a minimum
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
the default service rate should be
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
the credit for net metering until the
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
study was completed um and so again we'd
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
ask that you just honor that agreement
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
that was reached among the parties um
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
across the board in that docket
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
um and the final point that we would
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
like to make and i think you've heard
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
this this morning is simply
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there is a lot of value
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
we believe
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
around distributed energy resources and
 
01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:25.430 align:start position:0%
around distributed energy resources and
the

01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
excess energy that's put onto the grid
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of avoided transmission cost
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
avoided capacity costs obviously
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits and so
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
again we're just concerned about looking
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
at one side of the ledger and making a
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
reduction without looking at
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
all of the um pluses and minuses that
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
would that should be under consideration
 
01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:48.950 align:start position:0%
would that should be under consideration
um

01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
so you know we're looking and i think
 
01:38:53.350 --> 01:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
everybody is looking for to make sure
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
that compensation is fair um and
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
obviously minimizing cost shifting as
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
well but i think we really want to make
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we're looking at this kind of
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
fair and balanced way so um with that
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
and again we're respectfully requesting
 
01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
that you vote no at this time on this
 
01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:13.030 align:start position:0%
that you vote no at this time on this
bill spill

01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'll just add
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
one thing is that several of our members
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
as you heard from the department of
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
energy our small hydros are the early
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
adopters of the municipal host provision
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
that was passed just last year and we
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
have additional members that are
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
currently negotiating member agreements
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
for group net metering with
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and counties and schools
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
based on law that was just passed last
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
year which has a certain level of net
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
metering credit in it and so
 
01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
we would ask for consistency and not
 
01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:43.189 align:start position:0%
we would ask for consistency and not
changing

01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
the laws or the rules or the credit
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
value every year so that we may
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
in good faith negotiate with members
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
and that if the credit value
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
diminishes that will diminish the value
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is then given to those members
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the municipal host provision was
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
passed with the intention of having a
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
limited focused net metering expansion
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
that was going to directly benefit
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities counties and schools
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
i would ask that we sort of stay the
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
course and as has been mentioned let the
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
value of dr study continue
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
to answer a question that was asked
 
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.149 align:start position:0%
to answer a question that was asked
previously

01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
if this law passes
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
the puc could not then
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
reinstate the credit because the pc
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
can't override laws and so if the
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
legislature passes laws
 
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
unless you explicitly give the puc the
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
authority to change it or override it
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to do that and so
 
01:40:44.790 --> 01:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
i think that we should let that study
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
see its course and the docket process
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.590 --> 01:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr noah riverstein kelly
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.470 align:start position:0%
you have a question
yes

01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:40:58.480 --> 01:40:59.189 align:start position:0%
yes
i

01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
i understand that about the laws that
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
that the puc can't
 
01:41:05.590 --> 01:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.510 align:start position:0%
but the
legislature

01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
can always override the puc with the law
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes that's correct
 
01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes that's correct
follow-up

01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
in my world which has
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
kind of gone topsy-turvy because i'm not
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
quite sure of who does what where and
 
01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.510 align:start position:0%
quite sure of who does what where and
when

01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
is this still an adjudicative decision
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
and with the force
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
with the ability to force rulemaking
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the puc or is it a combined
 
01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.709 align:start position:0%
with the puc or is it a combined
decision

01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
between the department of energy and the
 
01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.149 align:start position:0%
between the department of energy and the
puc

01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
puc
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
um i can explain to you my understanding
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
is that the department of energy took
 
01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.470 align:start position:0%
is that the department of energy took
over

01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
managing the consultants that are doing
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
the study and so they are
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
seeing that process through the study
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
will be what it is the results will be
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
presented publicly the public utilities
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
commission which is the adjudicative
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
body would then
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
decide if it should open a new docket
 
01:42:15.590 --> 01:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
based on the evidence from the study
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
to then
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
develop the third generation what would
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
be the third generation of net metering
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
tariffs in new hampshire that would go
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
through an adjudicative docket process
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
01:42:31.510 --> 01:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
repre is a party to those dockets now
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
and would represent the state's interest
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
they could um
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
be a party to the docket
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
hire expert witnesses or have their own
 
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
staff be expert witnesses and present
 
01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.270 align:start position:0%
staff be expert witnesses and present
evidence

01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
to support
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
or if they don't like the results of the
 
01:42:50.790 --> 01:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
study in opposite of the studies to say
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
why they don't think it was accurate or
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
to support it if that's the position of
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
the state just like all the other
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
parties will be
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
presenting evidence having witnesses and
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.119 --> 01:43:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
you representative pimentel
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.629 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.639 --> 01:43:17.470 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.109 align:start position:0%
this
legislation

01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
well the docket that we're talking about
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
from what i understand you your all
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
parties are going to be involved and
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
they are going to look at a fair
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
market value for
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
um how to
 
01:43:34.719 --> 01:43:36.629 align:start position:0%
um how to
um

01:43:36.629 --> 01:43:36.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
generators customer generators
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
only applying to
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
new customer generators
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm curious of your opinion of how
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
that will affect
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
the increase or or how that will affect
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
new generators as far as
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
how how will it uh prevent them
 
01:44:14.639 --> 01:44:15.590 align:start position:0%
how how will it uh prevent them
um

01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:16.709 align:start position:0%
um
would

01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
be a damper on new power generation
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
um first i would say that uh in our view
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
the way that new is used in in this
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
legislation is a bit ambiguous it's
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
unclear to us if it's um new to
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
registering as a customer generator or
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
new to existing
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
for example a lot of the hydros have
 
01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.270 align:start position:0%
for example a lot of the hydros have
existed

01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
existed
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
for quite a while have been in service
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
and generating since the 1980s
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
however they are newly uh eligible as
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
customer generators and so
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
to us it's a little bit ambiguous what
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
new in this context means but certainly
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
if the value of that metering credit is
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
lowered by any amount in this case by
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
the compliance of the rps cost
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
the the payback to make investments in
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
developing new distributed energy
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
resources will be extended
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh and the value given back to members
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
that participate in group net metering
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
will be lowered so
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
it will certainly not encourage the
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
development of more new distributed
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay see no other further questions
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time nice testimony
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
and the chair at this time would like to
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
call up our last speaker the
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
our distinguished orator the honorable
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:46.930 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't know about that
 
01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:50.149 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't know about that
[Laughter]

01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:51.830 align:start position:0%
some people call me wordy
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:55.109 align:start position:0%
some people call me wordy
[Laughter]

01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
good good morning um mr chairman and
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'm assistant
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
mayor clifton bilo of the city of
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
lebanon here to testify on behalf of the
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
city in support of this legislation
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
um we are a member of clean energy new
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire but we on this bill part ways
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
with on this
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
and it might seem uh that
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's against our own
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
self-interest and that of other
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities in general and renewable
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
energy advocates and developers
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
because it would reduce the default
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
service energy
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
default energy service credit that large
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
group net meter generation projects
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
receive for their experts exports to the
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
grid by the amount of the rps compliance
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
costs that are embedded in those rates
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh the city supports this change in the
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
compensation rate because it's the right
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
and to eliminate one of the substantial
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
and problematic
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
cross subsidies
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
that occur
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
under current net metering tariffs in
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
place since 2017.
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
projects are currently being planned and
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
implemented that count on the
 
01:47:03.590 --> 01:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
continuation of this inequity through
 
01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
continuation of this inequity through
2040

01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
2040
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
so the sooner it's corrected the better
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
the problem with the current
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
compensation is that it creates a
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
missing money problem that results in
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
substantial and i would say ironic undue
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
cost shifting that did not occur before
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
2017 with traditional debt metering this
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
particular change
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
in how rps compliance costs are
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
calculated creating the current missing
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
money or cost shifting problem was not
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
explicitly recognized by any of the
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
parties the puc staff or the
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners in
 
01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.790 align:start position:0%
commissioners in
de1657

01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
de1657
 
01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.709 align:start position:0%
de1657
um

01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know in which that new iteration of
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
net metering tariffs were developed um
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
at that time i represented the city as
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
both advocate and expert witness and was
 
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
actively involved in negotiating two
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
competing settlement agreements that
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
actually became the basis for the pucs
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
order that's referenced in this bill
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'd like to briefly explain you know how
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
this has changed because it helps to
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
understand um the nature of this problem
 
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:03.830 align:start position:0%
understand um the nature of this problem
um

01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
each electricity supplier including the
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
utility default service has an rps
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
compliance obligation based on the
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
amount of electricity delivered over the
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
course of the year to their customers
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
currently wrecks need to be procured and
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
retired or alternative compliance
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
payments made equal to about 25 percent
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
of the power produced or supplied
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
in traditional net metering which
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes called 1.0 when customer
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
generator exports to the grid in in
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
effect turns the meter backwards so that
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
power exported to the grid carries
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
forward as a kwh credit to be used to
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
offset future kwh consumption with pve
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
so a customer that gets about um and you
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
can use any number here but say gets a
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
thousand megawatts hour
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
of power delivered to them over the
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
course of the year but over that same
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
year might export 500 megawatt hours to
 
01:49:03.750 --> 01:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
um ends up consuming and paying for a
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
net of 500 megawatt hours
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
their suppliers rps compliance
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
obligation under this kilowatt hour
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
crediting system is actually just based
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
on the net 500 megawatt hours
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
um which the customers already paid the
 
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
full rate for so it includes their share
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
of rps compliance so there's no cost
 
01:49:28.629 --> 01:49:28.639 align:start position:0%
shifting problem here
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
under the new tariffs
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
instead of carrying that negative kwh
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
credit forward if there's surplus you
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
know exports to the grid in any given
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
monthly billing cycle it gets monetized
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
and paid the full default service rate
 
01:49:43.199 --> 01:49:44.070 align:start position:0%
and paid the full default service rate
credit

01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
the problem is when the customer or
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
or members of a group in group net
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
metering turn around and receive that
 
01:49:51.119 --> 01:49:52.390 align:start position:0%
metering turn around and receive that
power

01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
that is counted towards the rps
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
compliance obligation so in the same
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
example the rps compliance obligation is
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
a thousand megawatt hours instead of 500
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
and because you've given full uh credit
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
for 500 of those there's there's no
 
01:50:10.390 --> 01:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
revenue from that customer
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
or that customer generator
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
to pay for the additional 500 megawatt
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
hours of rps compliance obligation
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
so that creates a cost shift that other
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
customers have to pick up
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
and again this this was not com
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
contemplated back in 2017 although there
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
was a sense
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
in all the settlement discussions that
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
prop maybe full default service rate is
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
maybe over compensation more than what
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
it should be but that other things like
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
no credit for transmission were under
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
compensation so it was felt and the
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
utilities actually agreed all agreed to
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
this at the time that it was a rough
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
justice that it was fair but without
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
thinking about this particular problem
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
and and so i just want to give a very
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
specific example um involving the city
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
of lebanon about how this actually could
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
play out in this one to five megawatt
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
range which i might add you know the
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
commission's order and those settlements
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
never contemplated it will apply to the
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
one to five megawatts so you're talking
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
about much larger scale of impact so
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
just as an example the city last month
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
entered into a interconnection agreement
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
with liberty in which we're going to pay
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
over half a million dollars for
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
distribution and actually some
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
transmission system upgrades so we could
 
01:51:24.149 --> 01:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
interco connect five megawatts i mean
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
five 200 kw micro turbines there will be
 
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
one megawatt installation of landfill
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
gas to energy
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
so that's going to produce about 8 000
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours a year
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
which we can um
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
and that equals 8 000 renewable energy
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
credits or wrecks or certificates worth
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
about 35 each in today's market
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
generating value to the city of over a
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars a year
 
01:51:49.599 --> 01:51:50.550 align:start position:0%
quarter million dollars a year
um

01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is roughly equivalent to about six
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
to seven megawatts of solar pv or about
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
or maybe 303 megawatts or so of hydro
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the wreck revenue
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
those 8 000 megawatt hours
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
exported the grid in a group net
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
metering arrangement at current rates of
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
around 10 cents per kilowatt hour would
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
generate another 800 000 in revenue to
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
the city that can be used dollar for
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
dollar to offset the same amount of
 
01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:16.629 align:start position:0%
dollar to offset the same amount of
power

01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
supply costs for group members so the
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
utility under that default energy
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
service would still have an rps
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
compliance obligation for some 8 000
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours delivered to group
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
members but no revenue from that group
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
or the host to pay for those compliance
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
costs shifting all of those costs to
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
other rate payers who aren't directly
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
participating in net metering and this
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
number is actually readily noble every
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
time the puc approves default service
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
rates um part of that calculation
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
there's a line here this is just the
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
sheet from the from their um
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
proceeding that specifies what that
 
01:52:54.229 --> 01:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
number is so today for liberty that's
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
about um
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
0.68 cents per kilowatt hour and it's a
 
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
little higher about point seven seven
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour um uh for
 
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:04.070 align:start position:0%
cents per kilowatt hour um uh for
eversource

01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
so that eight thousand megawatt hours
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
works out to about fifty five to sixty
 
01:53:11.189 --> 01:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars in rps compliance
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
costs from which there's no revenue from
 
01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:16.070 align:start position:0%
costs from which there's no revenue from
from

01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
the the people for whom that power
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
supplied to pay for those costs so those
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
are the costs that would be shifted in
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
this kind of scale of of one to five
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
and i think the irony is
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know in our case the city can
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
benefit from selling those wrecks for
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
its generation earning a quarter million
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
dollars a year while paying nothing for
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
its own rps compliance cost and that of
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
its remaining group members
 
01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.750 align:start position:0%
its remaining group members
and

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:46.149 --> 01:53:46.159 align:start position:0%
even though in theory selling those
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
wrecks means you are assigning the
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
renewable attribute
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
of that generation to others there's
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
just an irresistible tendency for the
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
city and other
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities to say that we are
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
offsetting some or all of our load with
 
01:54:03.109 --> 01:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
group net metered pv or in our case
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
landfill gas while paying nothing
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
actually for rps compliance
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
and of course i'm assuming that
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities are not otherwise
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
exempted from rps compliance obligations
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
up which is an exemption the city
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't support
 
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
i did say that this would eliminate one
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
of two substantial cross subsidies that
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
i think are problematic you've heard me
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
talk about the other one and that
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
regards transmission costs i won't go
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
into detail on that but but just to come
 
01:54:33.189 --> 01:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
complete this example
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
liberty and its customers pay for
 
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:36.390 align:start position:0%
liberty and its customers pay for
transmission

01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh based on our share of the monthly
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
hour of coincident peak demand measured
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
by an actual meter at the interface
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
between the transmission grid and the
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
distribution grid
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
for some reason eversource doesn't have
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
meters in that location so i don't
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
understand how they do it but in any
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
case with liberty it's clear cut and
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
they've agreed that if we're exporting
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
850 kw of power to the distribution grid
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
at the hour of coincident peak demand it
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
will lower transmission costs
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
if we did that on average over the
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
course of the year which we can do
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
because we're we'll run like a base load
 
01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.950 align:start position:0%
because we're we'll run like a base load
plant

01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
plant
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
that is worth some over 125 000 a year
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
in reduced
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
transmission cost but we would not
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
receive any credit for that
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
but it does actually result in savings
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
that other customers benefit from so you
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
could say
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
between the two there's a trade-off
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
but that being said i think it's still
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
worth you know so i do propose an
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
amendment um in in the text it's in red
 
01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
on the last page
 
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
to just add um a provision and that and
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
by no later than december 31st 2024
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
which gives almost two years from now
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
the commission shall determine through
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
an adjudicated proceeding an equitable
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism for giving credit for actual
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission charges caused by
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
such customer generators
 
01:55:57.760 --> 01:55:58.709 align:start position:0%
such customer generators
um

01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know i think if you hadn't kept them
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
up please yeah if you had an amendment
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
like that i think it would gender more
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bicameral support but even if
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
you don't a minute i think it's worth
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
sending to the senate because quite
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
honestly i've tried for the past three
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
years to get senators up to speed on
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
this problem with limited success and so
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
i think it would be worth
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
presenting that issue for the senators
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
to understand because i don't think they
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
really understand it with what they did
 
01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
last year in expanding that metering so
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there thank you thank you miss
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'll the chair will indulge in asking a
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
question first i think you hit on part
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
of the question i was going to ask you
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
two things uh it could be looked at
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
still by the senate and the and i we've
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that said that the puc
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
docket uh should be coming out this
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
spring so there would be time for the
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
senate to decide whether or not
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh whatever the puc says but also would
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
this also send a quiz message to the puc
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh on the intent of the legislation uh
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
to help them in in their docket
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
i i think it would um one of the subtle
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
things here is that the reference to the
 
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
order in statute part of that order says
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
that if you um interconnect under these
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
net metering 2.0 tariffs you are
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
grandfathered till 2040
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
and we won't change those rates so to
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
the extent we revise rates going forward
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
it'd only be applicable to new projects
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
so so that's sort of why this is a
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
concern is because of that grant
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
grandfathering position that the
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
commission would
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
by sort of its own word uh wouldn't
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
go back and i think everybody's
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
expectations you know from the
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
legislature wouldn't go back and change
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
these terms unless they had guidance
 
01:57:52.239 --> 01:57:53.030 align:start position:0%
these terms unless they had guidance
from

01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature that that would be
 
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
i mean they'll change them in the next
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
iteration but that could be a year or
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
two out
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
from what you just said then would that
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
address the concerns of the hydro
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
association that just spoke about
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
changes in contracts they've already
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
entered into with customers based on
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
the rps being included
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
would what address that
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
i thought what you were saying is that
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
the public utilities commission would
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
likely not
 
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
likely not
retrofit

01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
retrofit
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
oh be retro you know retroactive um i i
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
think that would would help to clarify
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
that legislation that maybe this only
 
01:58:38.159 --> 01:58:39.430 align:start position:0%
that legislation that maybe this only
applies

01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
applies
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
to to to projects that um
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
are somehow new after the data passage
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the bill um so that
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's gone under the current
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
statute wouldn't
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
be disturbed you know that that might be
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable or adding the
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
promise of looking at an equitable
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
transmission credit might also uh be a
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
way to balance that
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
 
01:59:06.719 --> 01:59:07.510 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that
and

01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up and so
 
01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
the references earlier to the fact that
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
new was a little ambiguous in terms of
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
what it referred to in this bill do you
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
think that that's another piece that
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
might need to be
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
specified in order for it to achieve its
 
01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.310 align:start position:0%
specified in order for it to achieve its
objective

01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
objective
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
um right when i was looking at this with
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
our city manager and mayor and energy
 
01:59:26.239 --> 01:59:27.589 align:start position:0%
our city manager and mayor and energy
committee

01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
i said i can't really tell whether this
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
would apply to our landfill gas project
 
01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:32.870 align:start position:0%
would apply to our landfill gas project
um

01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:34.070 align:start position:0%
um
because

01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
well we're right at that one megawatt
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
threshold um
 
01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:38.790 align:start position:0%
threshold um
um

01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
we now have an agree an interconnection
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
agreement so from certain purposes of
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
the puc were already in the queue
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:59:49.199 --> 01:59:50.629 align:start position:0%
and um
current

01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
tariffs would apply
 
01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:53.589 align:start position:0%
tariffs would apply
um

01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
because that was sort of the basis of
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
which to cut things off on the other
 
01:59:59.189 --> 01:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
hand we will be new the thing isn't
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
constructed yet um
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
so so that isn't real clear and also
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
just sitting here reading this the
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
strikeout of applicable to large
 
02:00:07.599 --> 02:00:08.709 align:start position:0%
strikeout of applicable to large
customers

02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
customers
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
that could be slightly problematic in
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
that the provisions of that order
 
02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.709 align:start position:0%
that the provisions of that order
only

02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:00:14.719 --> 02:00:15.910 align:start position:0%
only
apply

02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:16.790 align:start position:0%
apply
to

02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
up to one megawatt there's nothing in
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
that order that would apply to greater
 
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
than one megawatt the language and
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
current law that's being stricken out
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
says you're going to apply what was
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
applied to large customer generators the
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
100 kw to one megawatt will apply to
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
these new one to five megawatt projects
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so it did just occur to me that
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
that that that there may be an issue
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
there i'm not sure
 
02:00:43.589 --> 02:00:43.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:43.599 --> 02:00:44.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
my question i have an observation as
 
02:00:48.719 --> 02:00:49.589 align:start position:0%
my question i have an observation as
well

02:00:49.589 --> 02:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
the question is uh
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
even though the current bill doesn't uh
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
have say anything about avoided
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
transmission the puc is absolutely free
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
to do that as a result of its docket
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
right i do think that that is definitely
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
part of the value of der that is being
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
that's part of the study that everyone
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
agreed should be looked at yes my
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
observation is to thank you very much
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
for your written testimony and i
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
encourage it in the future because i can
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
only capture 10 of what you say right
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
and i think i think everything was in my
 
02:01:22.229 --> 02:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
written testimony except for a little
 
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
yes before we move on i it's
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock and i think
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
recess this public hearing temporarily
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
so i can open up
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
hp 1629
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
hb 1629 is open for public hearing and
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
i'm recessing 1629 until the completion
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
i stand corrected i
 
02:01:59.109 --> 02:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know what the word assume means
 
02:01:59.119 --> 02:02:00.790 align:start position:0%
you know what the word assume means
so

02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:02.550 --> 02:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
i thought we were running short on time
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
in fact we had plenty of time so my part
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
my apologies please go ahead
 
02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
sampson with your question we are still
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
in public hearing for the current bill
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:16.239 --> 02:02:18.149 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
02:02:20.639 --> 02:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
bilo

02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
bilo
 
02:02:21.599 --> 02:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
bilo
um

02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
according to your own testimony um
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that this rps compliance
 
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:29.350 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that this rps compliance
cost

02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned before
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
there were some factors that were
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
not considered and may be beneficial
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
others that may be undervalued or
 
02:02:48.790 --> 02:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
overvalued and this was considered to be
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a compromise right
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
and in your own uh financial example you
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
used for your city of lebanon you
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you could actually
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
determine that you would be creating a
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
transmission reduction cost for liberty
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
utility yes and in in net if i'm
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
not mistaken and hearing what you said
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
in net you're actually giving a benefit
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
to every other customer without any
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
compensation right so with all this
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
stuff going on
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you think it would be better
 
02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
for us not to act on this bill right now
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
because of the puc docket that we're
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
waiting for uh
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
because you guys made a mistake back in
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
2017 right so now you're saying before
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
we have a new study why not make another
 
02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:33.810 align:start position:0%
mistake is that correct um
 
02:03:33.810 --> 02:03:35.109 align:start position:0%
mistake is that correct um
[Music]

02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
no i'm not saying let's make another
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
mistake i'm saying let's fix something
 
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.750 align:start position:0%
mistake i'm saying let's fix something
that

02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
nobody intended
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know it dawned on me about six
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
months later that th this changed and i
 
02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
went around and talked to people um both
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
puc staff and other parties
 
02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
and the utility and and it hadn't really
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
registered with anybody that's that
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
the way
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
that netting twh reduced the calculation
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the compliance obligation and
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
monetizing dinnet that just wasn't on
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
anyone's radar screen so
 
02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:13.830 align:start position:0%
anyone's radar screen so
um

02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
but but because of the protracted
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:04:19.990 --> 02:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
the idea of the the value of the er
 
02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
study came out of those settlements and
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
was part of that order and and it's just
 
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
taken a long time to to get it this far
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
um and and quite honestly i'm not even
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
sure this specific little piece was
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually is actually part of that study
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
although it'll be subsumed within the
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
question of
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
is full default service rate uh
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
credit appropriate or not so i think it
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
will be addressed
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and follow-up question uh the
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
in light of
 
02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.149 align:start position:0%
in light of
this

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
um do you see any disadvantage for the
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
legislature getting ahead of this and
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
passing something now before that comes
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
out versus waiting until comes out and
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
then passing a law maybe is there any
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
pro or con for this well personally i
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
think yes because um
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
there could be a lot of projects that
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
get developed and locked in between now
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
and when the commission actually makes a
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
new decision
 
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
and and that would be locking in this
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
inequity um which i'm just uncomfortable
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
and the city you know i i didn't make
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
this decision to support this on my own
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
um you know it's with the support of the
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
city um
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't seem right i mean i mean
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
we have we have ambitions to put in a
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
02:05:36.639 --> 02:05:37.750 align:start position:0%
lot more
um

02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
larger pv pv and storage
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
we quite honestly prefer to do it under
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
the limited producers approach rather
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
than net metering because at this kind
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
of scale it's not
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
personally you know as the person who
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
sponsored the first bill that created
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
net metering with jeb bradley way back
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
in 1996
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
i never imagined that net metering would
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
be getting used for the scale projects
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
um it yeah so that that's just a whole
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
nother story thank you very much
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts question
 
02:06:12.239 --> 02:06:15.589 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts question
please

02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you cliff i'm almost afraid to ask
 
02:06:18.639 --> 02:06:19.910 align:start position:0%
thank you cliff i'm almost afraid to ask
um

02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
having been with you all those years
 
02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:25.669 align:start position:0%
having been with you all those years
um

02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
can you give me a concrete
 
02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:30.470 align:start position:0%
can you give me a concrete
explanation

02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:31.270 align:start position:0%
explanation
or

02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
figures and not all the convoluted ones
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
what would this actually mean
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
to your town
 
02:06:38.719 --> 02:06:39.750 align:start position:0%
to your town
so

02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
you have an electric bill now
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill
 
02:06:44.719 --> 02:06:46.629 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill
which

02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
in your words is the right thing to do
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
what would it mean as far as an expense
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
for your town
 
02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:56.470 align:start position:0%
for your town
um

02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:57.350 align:start position:0%
um
well

02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
if if it applied to our landfill gas to
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
energy project and i'm not sure it would
 
02:07:04.079 --> 02:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
energy project and i'm not sure it would
um

02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
then it would reduce our compensation by
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
on the order of seven percent
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
which our project would still be viable
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
with that reduction and i i say mike
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
right now we're approved for one
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
megawatt interconnection we we do
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
anticipate um
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
some some landfill expansion that could
 
02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
we may want to add another 200 kw
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
turbine in which case we would be thrown
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
into this larger group net metering
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
situation um
 
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.030 align:start position:0%
situation um
and

02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
in that event
 
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know if this bill passed it would
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
apply to the entirety of the project
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
so so we we we would lose revenue from
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
that element
 
02:07:45.599 --> 02:07:46.709 align:start position:0%
that element
um

02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand we're getting a
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
lot of money from selling the wrecks
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
potentially from the project so it just
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
only seems right that we should pay for
 
02:07:57.669 --> 02:07:57.679 align:start position:0%
our rps compliance obligation um for for
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
the power that does end up getting
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
delivered to us and our group members
 
02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.149 align:start position:0%
delivered to us and our group members
follow-up

02:08:04.149 --> 02:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
cliff without
 
02:08:05.599 --> 02:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
cliff without
without

02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
disclosing any
 
02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
major secrets can you quantify that for
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
me seven percent would be
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about that's that
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
well it's right here it's um about 60
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
000 a year
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that's sixty thousand dollar may i
 
02:08:28.069 --> 02:08:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's good that's sixty thousand dollars
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
from i don't know how many customers
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
would be involved say that's around the
 
02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:36.629 align:start position:0%
would be involved say that's around the
average

02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
average
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
is that enough
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
to lower
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
electric rates
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
in general well
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
it just it adds up because if that's
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
this one project you had a bunch of
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
other projects and realized that this is
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
for the next 18 years
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
eventually it's real money
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:02.709 align:start position:0%
 
see

02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative partial question please
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
thanks so much chair
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
um i understand uh the in principle how
 
02:09:11.189 --> 02:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
bill that you know provides some equity
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
and uh support for the uh rps
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
but um i'm so concerned because this was
 
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of this came about as you said
 
02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:21.990 align:start position:0%
a lot of this came about as you said
1996

02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
1996
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
and we've grown quite a bit and these
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
loopholes have grown quite a bit since
 
02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.229 align:start position:0%
loopholes have grown quite a bit since
then

02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
i can
 
02:09:29.589 --> 02:09:29.599 align:start position:0%
understand where this is you know
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
you've benefited from this but as far as
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
having your transmission charges uh
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know avoided interesting charges
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's another big part that's another
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
big loophole right there yeah question
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's quite a few i mean i'm just
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
trying to get a background see if i
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
and so the question is is that
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
is this bill without your amendment to
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
piecemeal and addressing the situation
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
and you consider the amendment to be
 
02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.310 align:start position:0%
and you consider the amendment to be
necessary

02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:09:58.320 --> 02:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
necessary
to

02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
balancing out the uh
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
if nothing else the finances on this
 
02:10:03.040 --> 02:10:03.910 align:start position:0%
if nothing else the finances on this
bill

02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:04.709 align:start position:0%
bill
um

02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
well if this committee passed this
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
without the amendment i would advocate
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
for the amendment over in the senate and
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
quite honestly i think it's unlikely the
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
senate would pass this bill
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
without an amendment or whether they
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
pass it at all but i think it's worth
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
taking the time to educate the senators
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
on the energy committee about this issue
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
and problem so they so they understand
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
it better quite honestly
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up
 
02:10:31.679 --> 02:10:33.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up
representative

02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.950 align:start position:0%
representative
pimento

02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
pimento
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh unlike the
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
chair i only understood about three
 
02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
chair i only understood about three
percent

02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
of what you said fair enough um
 
02:10:43.679 --> 02:10:44.550 align:start position:0%
of what you said fair enough um
my

02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:48.629 align:start position:0%
question is
about

02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
well the first question is
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
are you privy to what is going on now in
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
the docket that we're referring to
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah so the city is still a active
 
02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
intervener and party in that docket yes
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up mr trump
 
02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
the the follow-up is that
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
i mean we're talking about a couple of
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
things here what's in this bill
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
and you brought up
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
another part where it basically goes the
 
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
other way which of course i don't
 
02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:23.189 align:start position:0%
other way which of course i don't
understand

02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
why not
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
make the docket aware of this
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
and have them
 
02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
and have them
[Music]

02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
roll all of this into whatever it is
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
their final decision
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
i i think this issue will be provoked
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
when this gets
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
my guess is that after this study is
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
complete and
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
the department of energy convenes
 
02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:51.119 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to review it that somebody
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
probably the department will petition
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
the commission to
 
02:11:58.229 --> 02:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
probably in the same docket
 
02:11:58.239 --> 02:11:59.589 align:start position:0%
probably in the same docket
to

02:11:59.589 --> 02:11:59.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
issue an order of notice to to begin the
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
process of
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
considering proposals for net metering
 
02:12:06.079 --> 02:12:07.589 align:start position:0%
considering proposals for net metering
3.0

02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
3.0
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know what what the tariffs will be
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
going forward because that's always what
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
was contemplated in the order that's
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
referenced here
 
02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
which was always recognized as an sort
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
of interim step because there was just
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
too many data gaps to be able to make uh
 
02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:24.149 align:start position:0%
too many data gaps to be able to make uh
informed

02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
informed
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
one go ahead
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
getting back to
 
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
something that's already been asked
 
02:12:39.510 --> 02:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
knowing all of that
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
you still feel that
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
we should go forward with this bill
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
with amendment
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just waiting for what will
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
happen out of this docket
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
yes i think that would be worthwhile
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
because it kind of
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
begins to straighten out two things that
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think are
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
sort of you know obvious problems and
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
and and that the suggestion of giving
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
the commission until december 31st of
 
02:13:06.079 --> 02:13:07.589 align:start position:0%
the commission until december 31st of
2024

02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
2024
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
um would would allow them to to proceed
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
under that docket with that adjudication
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
that that would be more time than was
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
originally given to the commission to to
 
02:13:19.350 --> 02:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
do what they did
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
which was a pretty
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
which was a very robust um uh a
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
proceeding at the time
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it was rushed but but
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
this actually gives even more time for
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
the commission to sort that out and
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
would allow them to apply it um to these
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
projects that that you know already are
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
kind of in the pipeline but before they
 
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
set something for new projects going
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
forward that what was contemplated in
 
02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
that order all along is
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
that um if you're in the interconnection
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
queue before you know in that order was
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
i forget what it was like a certain date
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
in september even though the order was
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
in june if you were in the
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue by that date you
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
could be grandfathered under the
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
original net metering and if you got an
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
after that date you would be subject to
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
the new net metering tariffs and and the
 
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
way it was also written you can always
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
go to the new tariff but you can't go
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
back to the old tariff once you leave
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
the original tariff so i'm personally on
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
net metering 1.0 i could switch to 2.0
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
it would actually be financially
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
advantageous for me to do that but but
 
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
i've have haven't bothered um
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
and so one you know one option if
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
nothing happens and these two things are
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
adjusted and other things are adjusted
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
it may be that projects actually want to
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
move from 2.0 to 3.0 or not you know
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
remains to be seen um but the idea would
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
be you can't go back and and once you're
 
02:14:50.629 --> 02:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
once you've gotten an approved thing
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
because it is important to the market
 
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
and to the parties to have some
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
certainty as to what the deal is because
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
just people are making major investment
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
decisions based on those deal terms i
 
02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
think it is reasonable to to have this
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
kind of grandfathering mechanism
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
and but it's precisely because of that
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
why i think it would be better to
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
straighten this out sooner than later
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
and not let
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
tens and 20s and 30s megawatts of new
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
new generation get locked into something
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
that really
 
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
isn't right doesn't feel right on the
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'm beginning to hear
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
redundant answers to questions
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee if you have a
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
completely new and different and
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
improved question please
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's a very high bar
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you
 
02:15:43.599 --> 02:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you
actually

02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the committee i was
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
hoping that you could go back
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the original explanation that you
 
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
gave us
 
02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:53.910 align:start position:0%
gave us
for

02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
my my understanding is that what you're
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
saying is that we are currently uh
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
securing a credit that we shouldn't be
 
02:16:01.199 --> 02:16:02.310 align:start position:0%
securing a credit that we shouldn't be
securing

02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
securing
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh because of the way the original deal
 
02:16:06.069 --> 02:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
was structured that we're trying to
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate which i wish that was in the
 
02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:08.629 align:start position:0%
eliminate which i wish that was in the
original

02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
original
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
testimony to to make us understand sort
 
02:16:12.950 --> 02:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
of what this is solving for
 
02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:13.750 align:start position:0%
of what this is solving for
um

02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:15.830 --> 02:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that it may not be clear
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
here so i i was just wondering if you
 
02:16:19.119 --> 02:16:20.069 align:start position:0%
here so i i was just wondering if you
could

02:16:20.069 --> 02:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
you could reiterate um
 
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
the point that you're making about that
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
not double dipping but you know the the
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
fact that it's being credited credited
 
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
in multiple places and so it's not
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
actually accurate um
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think it is sort of double
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
possibly triple dipping
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
which is which is the thing that bothers
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
me in good conscience you you've got the
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
renewable advocates and the
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities saying we want more of
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
these renewables but they're saying
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay for any of the ar
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
and we support the rps but we don't
 
02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay for any of the
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
rps compliance costs and we're going to
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
shift that to other customers now those
 
02:16:58.469 --> 02:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
do i do think those other customers
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
benefit in other ways like lower
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
transmission costs from what they'd
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise be
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know how much solar does that really
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
depends because some solar if it's east
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
phasing probably doesn't do anything
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
other solar if it's more west facing and
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
hits those afternoon summer peaks
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know can provide significant value
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
but there's you know
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
but because we don't separately value
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
that there's no sort of price signal for
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
new projects to recognize that they may
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
or may not produce this value because
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
there's we're saying all kilowatt hours
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
are are the same and that's not really
 
02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
true yeah
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i think we hit the limit uh on
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
the honorable
 
02:17:42.070 --> 02:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
and i will ask representative pemtel to
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
give us the blue sheet and the online
 
02:17:44.080 --> 02:18:00.870 align:start position:0%
give us the blue sheet and the online
results

02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
there are four
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
nine names on the uh
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
sheet opposing oh excuse me yes opposing
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
hp 1599
 
02:18:13.439 --> 02:18:14.790 align:start position:0%
hp 1599
and

02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
the remote testimony
 
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
two people support
 
02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:20.709 align:start position:0%
two people support
116

02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
116
 
02:18:20.719 --> 02:18:24.309 align:start position:0%
116
opposed

02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh with that
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
being said
 
02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative clay pitts before i
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing do you have a
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
question yes i'd like to ask the
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
question in the public hearing
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh of the chair
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
having heard about the possible
 
02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
having heard about the possible
um

02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
culmination of this study
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
in the spring
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
can we ask the powers to be to provide
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
the committee with an update
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
and update you say power should be
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
updated from the pucc
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
and the and department of energy says i
 
02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
will just cover all umbrellas on
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
the status
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
of that study at that point not
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily the details
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
but the status because i don't want it
 
02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
to get away for 10 years
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
i don't see why not we can certainly ask
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
him to give us an update status
 
02:19:24.070 --> 02:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
certainly absolutely
 
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
probably desirable yeah
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
public hearing is closed on
 
02:19:31.519 --> 02:19:34.230 align:start position:0%
public hearing is closed on
1599.

02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
1599.
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
and i guess being a victim i apologize
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
for being a victim of my own uh
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency but uh i guess we have an
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
extended lunch break until one o'clock
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
where we'll open up the next uh
 
02:19:47.359 --> 04:01:14.550 align:start position:0%
where we'll open up the next uh
bill

04:01:14.550 --> 04:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon everyone time to
 
04:01:18.630 --> 04:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
resume the
 
04:01:20.469 --> 04:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
sdna meeting for
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
february 8th
 
04:01:26.309 --> 04:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
and we have three public hearings to
 
04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
go through this afternoon the first one
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
we'll start here momentarily
 
04:01:34.150 --> 04:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
before we start i would just like to
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that if you want to
 
04:01:37.830 --> 04:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
speak on
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
any of the bills that we'll be hearing
 
04:01:40.870 --> 04:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
this afternoon
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
you need to fill out a pink card and
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
pass it along forward so that i have it
 
04:01:48.469 --> 04:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
in front of me in order for you to be
 
04:01:50.389 --> 04:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
bless you make a contribution
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
so the first bill that we'll hear this
 
04:02:02.710 --> 04:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon is house bill 1629-f
 
04:02:02.720 --> 04:02:03.590 align:start position:0%
afternoon is house bill 1629-f
n

04:02:03.590 --> 04:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
n
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
which is relative to default service for
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
net energy media metering
 
04:02:08.640 --> 04:02:09.750 align:start position:0%
net energy media metering
and

04:02:09.750 --> 04:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:12.070 --> 04:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
i will introduce the prime sponsor of
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
the bill representative berezne
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vos members of the
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
stne committee thank you for the
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce hb 1629 fm
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
relative to default service for net
 
04:02:25.520 --> 04:02:26.630 align:start position:0%
relative to default service for net
metering

04:02:26.630 --> 04:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
metering
 
04:02:29.030 --> 04:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
this bill aims to bring the net energy
 
04:02:31.750 --> 04:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
metering section of chapter 362 a
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
limited electrical energy productions
 
04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
act in line with the declared purpose of
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
the chapter specifically the declaration
 
04:02:41.830 --> 04:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
of purpose contains a finding that quote
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
the goals of this chapter should be
 
04:02:46.469 --> 04:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
pursued in a competitive environment
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to that in a second
 
04:02:50.229 --> 04:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
net metering is when an electricity
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
distributor is required to purchase
 
04:02:54.870 --> 04:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
excess electricity from their customer
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
the rate at which the distributor must
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
buy this electricity is currently the
 
04:03:00.150 --> 04:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
same as the rate at which it sells
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
electricity to other customers
 
04:03:05.110 --> 04:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
this requirement to buy and sell
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
electricity at the same price
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
means that the distributor is not able
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
to recoup overhead costs of facilitating
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
the transfer
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
when you are forced to buy and sell
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
something at the same price it is not a
 
04:03:18.150 --> 04:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
competitive environment
 
04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
of course there is no magic here this
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
missing overhead is recouped by raising
 
04:03:25.269 --> 04:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
electricity rates for everyone else
 
04:03:27.910 --> 04:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
hb 1629 simply adds the missing
 
04:03:30.309 --> 04:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
definition for calculating the rate so
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
that when an electricity distributor is
 
04:03:34.150 --> 04:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
buying from their customer they are they
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
are able to subtract their overhead
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
by allowing the distributor to recoup
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
their overhead it levels the playing
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
field and creates a more competitive
 
04:03:41.760 --> 04:03:43.269 align:start position:0%
field and creates a more competitive
environment

04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
environment
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
furthermore this has the added benefit
 
04:03:48.469 --> 04:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
of keeping electricity rates lower
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
fairness in a competitive market is
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
important for electricity distributors
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
and keeping electricity rates low is
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
important for electric customers and
 
04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
constituents for these two reasons i
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
urge you to support this bill
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
and from listening uh to earlier
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and other bills there were a
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
couple of recurring things that came up
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to point out
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
as it relates to this bill the first one
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
is regarding the puc docket on net
 
04:04:13.199 --> 04:04:14.469 align:start position:0%
is regarding the puc docket on net
metering

04:04:14.469 --> 04:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
metering
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that this bill is is more of a
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
policy change
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
or a policy
 
04:04:21.680 --> 04:04:23.110 align:start position:0%
or a policy
underlining

04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
underlining
 
04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of how that docket ends i
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
don't think um
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
it supersedes this bill
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing i wanted to
 
04:04:35.670 --> 04:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
mention is that i've tried getting
 
04:04:39.030 --> 04:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
information on how the default service
 
04:04:40.630 --> 04:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
rate is calculated
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
and it's been rather challenging um
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
getting getting these details so i think
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes one of the end
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
results will also be more transparency
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
and how um and how that that rate is
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
calculated i think that that will be
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
beneficial for
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
for this committee going forward
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
and finally if i may i would like to
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
read part two of the electric utility
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
restructuring chapter on the purpose
 
04:05:07.750 --> 04:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
and it says a transition to competitive
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
markets for the for electricity is
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
consistent with a directive of part two
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
article 83 of the new hampshire
 
04:05:17.189 --> 04:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
constitution which reads in part free
 
04:05:19.110 --> 04:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
and fair competition in the trades and
 
04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
industries is an inherent and essential
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
right of the people and should be
 
04:05:24.630 --> 04:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
protected against all monopolies and
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
conspiracies which tend to hinder or
 
04:05:26.319 --> 04:05:27.510 align:start position:0%
conspiracies which tend to hinder or
destroy

04:05:27.510 --> 04:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
destroy
 
04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
competitive markets should provide
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers with incentives to
 
04:05:33.830 --> 04:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
operate efficiently and cleanly open
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
markets for new and improved
 
04:05:37.510 --> 04:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
technologies provide electricity buyers
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
and sellers with the appropriate price
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
signals and improve public confidence in
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
the electric utility industry
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you with that i will
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and take any
 
04:05:47.920 --> 04:05:49.590 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and take any
questions

04:05:49.590 --> 04:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you so we have questions for
 
04:05:54.150 --> 04:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative berezni thank you for
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill representative
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
thomas is recognized for a question
 
04:06:00.309 --> 04:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:06:04.150 --> 04:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
my question um so in light of the
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
unbelievably unbelievably high spikes in
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
electric bills recently
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
will this bill um
 
04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
help to have people's electric bills
 
04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
lowered uh at least by enough to where
 
04:06:19.590 --> 04:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
they notice it
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
is this what this will
 
04:06:22.389 --> 04:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
will help do
 
04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
i can't guarantee that that will happen
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:27.840 --> 04:06:29.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative plett is recognized
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
04:06:34.389 --> 04:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair thank you mr
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
bharara representative berezni for
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
at first i was puzzled about the
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
language in this bill but
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
got it straightened out in my own head
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.950 --> 04:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
anything from default
 
04:06:50.960 --> 04:06:52.150 align:start position:0%
anything from default
service

04:06:52.150 --> 04:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:56.720 --> 04:06:58.630 align:start position:0%
 
excluding

04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
excluding
 
04:07:01.110 --> 04:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're excluding ancillary components of
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
iso numerous forward and forward
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
capacity market payments renewable
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard cost administrative
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
costs supplier profits and the other
 
04:07:10.630 --> 04:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
non-electrical energy components as
 
04:07:12.469 --> 04:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
determined by the commission is that
 
04:07:12.479 --> 04:07:13.429 align:start position:0%
determined by the commission is that
because

04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
the net net meter
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
is producing electricity that has no
 
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
capacity requirement
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
at all and
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
it has no no does not provide any
 
04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
ancillary service and is that why you're
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
excluding these costs because they're
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
not providing that benefit
 
04:07:34.229 --> 04:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct the the overhead that
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
the electric uh distributor has is not
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
the same as the overhead that somebody
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
producing you know with a few solar
 
04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
panels on their on their house so it
 
04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense that they would have
 
04:07:47.349 --> 04:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
that they would get paid for that
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:53.830 --> 04:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%

mcgee
 
04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
um in looking at the language i'm trying
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
to figure out how you
 
04:08:07.110 --> 04:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
came to the conclusion that all of these
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
ancillary items should be taken out of
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
the default generation supply cost
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
i just
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't understand how you arrived at this
 
04:08:15.760 --> 04:08:17.269 align:start position:0%
don't understand how you arrived at this
conclusion

04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
04:08:20.710 --> 04:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
going to help with competition
 
04:08:24.630 --> 04:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
so these these um this list is not
 
04:08:26.149 --> 04:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
the entire list
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
at the end here it says and any other
 
04:08:30.389 --> 04:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
non-electrical energy components as
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
determined by the commission
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
the idea is that only
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
the electrical energy portion of such
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
supplies should be excluded
 
04:08:42.149 --> 04:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
the other list are things that i was
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
able to gather from from what what
 
04:08:46.630 --> 04:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
things shouldn't be in the list
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
because because they're not part of the
 
04:08:51.269 --> 04:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
electrical energy portion
 
04:08:53.349 --> 04:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
um follow-up
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
and do you have an understanding of why
 
04:09:00.950 --> 04:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
or how these other components have
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
become part of the charges that folks
 
04:09:02.640 --> 04:09:03.510 align:start position:0%
become part of the charges that folks
pay

04:09:03.510 --> 04:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
pay
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to figure out how you
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
figured out as someone who's relatively
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
new to this
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
why these charges should not be included
 
04:09:14.950 --> 04:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
like what you used to develop that
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
calculation it's not so much that these
 
04:09:19.110 --> 04:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
charges shouldn't be included it's that
 
04:09:21.110 --> 04:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
the the fee should only be based on the
 
04:09:25.110 --> 04:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
and again why
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh because the net meter because the
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
person who's producing electricity does
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
not have uh all of the same uh expenses
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.670 --> 04:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
so you're trying to make the distributor
 
04:09:43.030 --> 04:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
have an eat
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
an even playing field with a small
 
04:09:45.359 --> 04:09:46.870 align:start position:0%
an even playing field with a small
producer

04:09:46.870 --> 04:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
producer
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for
 
04:09:51.600 --> 04:09:53.110 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for
representative

04:09:53.110 --> 04:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:53.120 --> 04:09:55.189 align:start position:0%
representative
berezni

04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
berezni
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh thank you
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
regina uh
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
is the rate that you're looking at
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
uh essentially
 
04:10:14.790 --> 04:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
avoided costs that was described in
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
the original purple
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
language that federal statute
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
is that is that how this is
 
04:10:22.640 --> 04:10:24.229 align:start position:0%
is that is that how this is
being

04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:10:24.239 --> 04:10:26.149 align:start position:0%
being
calculated

04:10:26.149 --> 04:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
well i'm not sure i understand your
 
04:10:27.520 --> 04:10:30.710 align:start position:0%
well i'm not sure i understand your
question

04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:30.720 --> 04:10:32.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:10:32.469 --> 04:10:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:35.349 --> 04:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
there's a federal law that focused
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
these types of technologies and they
 
04:10:43.279 --> 04:10:44.309 align:start position:0%
these types of technologies and they
used

04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
used
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
they they require that that the
 
04:10:49.189 --> 04:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
utilities cover the avoided costs of the
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
producers so it's their uh
 
04:10:53.040 --> 04:10:55.030 align:start position:0%
producers so it's their uh
um

04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
they still have all their overhead no
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
and so that's what you seem to be
 
04:11:02.950 --> 04:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
subtracting out so this is going to
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
traditional avoided costs is that what
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
04:11:09.670 --> 04:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
continue follow-up
 
04:11:20.790 --> 04:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
all set uh representative bresny to
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
follow up on the question that
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee asked
 
04:11:28.710 --> 04:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
are you saying in this legislation
 
04:11:28.720 --> 04:11:30.389 align:start position:0%
are you saying in this legislation
that

04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:34.389 --> 04:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
since customer generators do not
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
supply firm power
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be entitled to forward
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
capacity market payments
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
and since they don't
 
04:11:45.910 --> 04:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
have any administrative costs they
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be entitled to credits for
 
04:11:51.269 --> 04:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
since they're not a supplier that earns
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
profits they wouldn't be entitled to
 
04:11:57.429 --> 04:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
supplier profits
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
is what you're saying is that because
 
04:12:01.750 --> 04:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
these customer generators don't have
 
04:12:01.760 --> 04:12:02.630 align:start position:0%
these customer generators don't have
these

04:12:02.630 --> 04:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
costs they're not entitled to being
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for those costs
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
that's exactly
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
the goal of the bill yet
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
04:12:20.070 --> 04:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:21.830 --> 04:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:12:21.840 --> 04:12:23.189 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

04:12:23.189 --> 04:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
have you been contacted by anybody
 
04:12:30.550 --> 04:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
with a fiscal note because i am
 
04:12:33.110 --> 04:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
wondering and i'm going to ask you
 
04:12:33.800 --> 04:12:33.810 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
04:12:33.810 --> 04:12:35.510 align:start position:0%
do you know
[Music]

04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
or have any idea how much cutting out
 
04:12:40.870 --> 04:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
these costs
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
would save electrical customers on the
 
04:12:44.319 --> 04:12:46.469 align:start position:0%
would save electrical customers on the
whole

04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
so there is a fiscal note that was
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
submitted but it was after this was
 
04:12:53.110 --> 04:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
printed and i believe that the person
 
04:12:55.110 --> 04:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
speaking after me will have
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think he has copies of the fiscal note
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:04.229 --> 04:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay thank you
 
04:13:04.239 --> 04:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay thank you
okay

04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
04:13:13.030 --> 04:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
chairman my clarification is in just
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
reading the language that's here
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's not defining
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
the small generator it's defining that
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
these costs are being taken away from
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
the default
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
generation supply so that would be a
 
04:13:29.670 --> 04:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
very different kettle fish
 
04:13:32.469 --> 04:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
as to what we are saying here is
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
the way i read it is that for the
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of this section which is a
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
customer generators will be compensated
 
04:13:49.110 --> 04:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
and credited
 
04:13:49.120 --> 04:13:51.030 align:start position:0%
and credited
that

04:13:51.030 --> 04:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:51.040 --> 04:13:52.630 align:start position:0%
that
since

04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:13:55.269 --> 04:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
default service rate is mentioned
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
several times in the statute as being
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
the compensation mechanism for
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
net metering customers
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
that this definition of
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
default service would apply
 
04:14:09.199 --> 04:14:10.149 align:start position:0%
default service would apply
for

04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:14:12.389 --> 04:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
this section meaning this part of the
 
04:14:12.399 --> 04:14:13.510 align:start position:0%
this section meaning this part of the
statute

04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay and that metering statute thank you
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
that makes sense okay representative
 
04:14:20.309 --> 04:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
samsit has a question
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:14:22.239 --> 04:14:23.189 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
mr

04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
mr
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative for taking my call um
 
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
my my question
 
04:14:27.680 --> 04:14:30.469 align:start position:0%
my my question
um

04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
i think maybe the question was asked
 
04:14:34.070 --> 04:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
before uh
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
what what percentage or
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
if you take the current default rate
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
and you take out all these things that
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
you mentioned here
 
04:14:43.199 --> 04:14:45.110 align:start position:0%
you mentioned here
um

04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
how much what percentage of the costs
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
would be cut i mean are we talking one
 
04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
percent two percent fifty percent i mean
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh almost half almost half but i don't i
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't have i have to do the math dude
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i understand i'm not looking for an
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
exact number but you're saying almost
 
04:15:10.319 --> 04:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
exact number but you're saying almost
half

04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
half
 
04:15:11.600 --> 04:15:15.189 align:start position:0%
half
um

04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
so one thing that i had difficulty with
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
is finding out this information because
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's not defined anywhere and and it's
 
04:15:22.950 --> 04:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know i understand proprietary to
 
04:15:24.790 --> 04:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
each distributor but
 
04:15:24.800 --> 04:15:27.189 align:start position:0%
each distributor but
um

04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
could you speak a little bit louder
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
please okay so it was difficult to get
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
this as i uh i said in my testimony that
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh it was very difficult to find out in
 
04:15:38.469 --> 04:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
detailed information about the rate um
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps part of this you know
 
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
one of the end results of this bill is
 
04:15:44.630 --> 04:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
that uh we will know that
 
04:15:46.149 --> 04:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
because that you know you'll be you'll
 
04:15:48.229 --> 04:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
be necessary to provide that in order to
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
to execute
 
04:15:51.269 --> 04:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:15:51.279 --> 04:15:52.790 align:start position:0%
um but
yeah

04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:15:52.800 --> 04:15:55.030 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
well just one follow-up follow-up
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
i assume that you're aware that some of
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
these costs that are mentioned here
 
04:16:05.750 --> 04:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
are involved in
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure a stable supply of
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
energy and a reliable and non-volatile
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
supply of energy to the system
 
04:16:17.830 --> 04:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not like these things
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
are being thrown in there for no purpose
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
um they tend to
 
04:16:22.960 --> 04:16:24.070 align:start position:0%
um they tend to
help

04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
dispel some of the volatility in these
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
rates by ensuring for example the former
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
forward capacity market that there's
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
something there when you need it i mean
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
are you aware of the implications of
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
charges that why they're there i think
 
04:16:43.269 --> 04:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
if if those expenses are incurred they
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
the the the issue is when they're
 
04:16:52.389 --> 04:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
reimbursed without incurring those costs
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative berezni
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:17:03.670 --> 04:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative berezni for taking my
 
04:17:03.680 --> 04:17:06.950 align:start position:0%
representative berezni for taking my
question

04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:09.030 --> 04:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
we've had several discussions today
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
about net metering and the state of net
 
04:17:12.309 --> 04:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
metering in terms of the docket at the
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
puc for the value of net metering
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that what is
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
the the aim of this bill seems to be in
 
04:17:21.750 --> 04:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
further defining the rate setting and
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
how it would be appropriate to go
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
forward but there is an effort underway
 
04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
right now in the rate setting agency
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's defined by the legislature to
 
04:17:33.510 --> 04:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
take care of this and to look at it
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
deeply so i'm wondering whether
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
whether this may be i hate to say
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
premature since we've been using that so
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
much lately but but whether this is sort
 
04:17:46.870 --> 04:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
of um jumping the gun on what is
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
currently underway
 
04:17:52.389 --> 04:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
which has been a multi-year review uh of
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
how this should be valued so
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
these default rates and how they're
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
defined would be part of that review
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
and i just wonder if you could comment
 
04:18:02.149 --> 04:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
on that because this this seems to be
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:18:03.199 --> 04:18:05.269 align:start position:0%
sort of
um

04:18:05.269 --> 04:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's tangential to what the state has
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
already undertaken for trying to define
 
04:18:12.229 --> 04:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
how this should be done
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
i did i did cover that in my testimony a
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
04:18:15.520 --> 04:18:17.189 align:start position:0%
little bit
um

04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:17.199 --> 04:18:18.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
my my perspective on this is that this
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
this is a sort of enshrining policy that
 
04:18:24.870 --> 04:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
should already exist
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it will conflict with
 
04:18:29.670 --> 04:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh any puc decision
 
04:18:29.680 --> 04:18:34.469 align:start position:0%
uh any puc decision
um

04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:36.550 --> 04:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
did you need a follow-up well
 
04:18:39.030 --> 04:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
i have i mean my thinking is that if the
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
puc is in the midst of trying to figure
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
out how to assess this then it would
 
04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
definitely have an effect on them if we
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
change the law
 
04:18:49.110 --> 04:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
telling them what they could and could
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:54.550 --> 04:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
sorry the language in the bill says and
 
04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
any other electrical energy components
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
as determined by the commission so they
 
04:19:00.550 --> 04:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh it is still up to the commission to
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
additional questions for representative
 
04:19:08.880 --> 04:19:11.349 align:start position:0%
additional questions for representative
berezni

04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
berezni
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out how to wear
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
this would default service rates or do
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know if default service rates
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
for the regular customer who's not a net
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
meter or a medium nearing person
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
that these things are included in the
 
04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that they they are
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
so if i am net metering
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
and 50 of my output
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
is sold back
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
and the other 50
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
is not
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
will some
 
04:19:56.830 --> 04:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:19:56.840 --> 04:19:58.469 align:start position:0%
of these
charges

04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
charges
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
that are currently in default service
 
04:20:04.790 --> 04:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
be applicable to me
 
04:20:07.269 --> 04:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
on the portion of the electricity that i
 
04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
do not
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
send back to the grid
 
04:20:13.110 --> 04:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah are you talking about the overhead
 
04:20:13.120 --> 04:20:14.149 align:start position:0%
yeah are you talking about the overhead
charges

04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
charges
 
04:20:15.750 --> 04:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
all of the charges that are included the
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
ones you want to exclude
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
oh may i
 
04:20:21.269 --> 04:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
yes you're the one you're still
 
04:20:23.110 --> 04:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
answering the questions the wins you the
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
ones you wish to exclude would they be
 
04:20:28.149 --> 04:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
04:20:30.389 --> 04:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
default rate
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
of the service that i'm not selling to
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
the grid or that i'm not giving back or
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
that i'm not not metering because i'm
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
going to be a consumer
 
04:20:46.149 --> 04:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:48.149 --> 04:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
i i would assume that it would be the
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
same for what you sell back versus what
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
you are you saying that
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
well if you're not selling it then i
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
guess i'm not really sure i understand
 
04:20:56.319 --> 04:20:59.269 align:start position:0%
guess i'm not really sure i understand
um

04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
are you saying do you get something
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
well if
 
04:21:05.110 --> 04:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
if i knit we're not going to have a
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
discussion no let's not have it okay so
 
04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
what representative
 
04:21:16.070 --> 04:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
callie pitts is asking you is
 
04:21:16.080 --> 04:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
callie pitts is asking you is
should

04:21:17.750 --> 04:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:21:20.550 --> 04:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
you pay the full default service rate
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
and of course the answer to that is yes
 
04:21:28.950 --> 04:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
that that's what
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
your rate would be
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
so she's asking you
 
04:21:33.040 --> 04:21:34.389 align:start position:0%
so she's asking you
if

04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
the portion that they
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
that the customer generator sells to the
 
04:21:39.040 --> 04:21:40.790 align:start position:0%
that the customer generator sells to the
utility

04:21:40.790 --> 04:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
utility
 
04:21:42.389 --> 04:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
should that also
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
be credited at the default service rate
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
i thought it was the part that you okay
 
04:21:47.600 --> 04:21:49.670 align:start position:0%
i thought it was the part that you okay
um

04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:53.670 --> 04:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
it should not be credited as the default
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
service rate because that's i mean
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's the point of the bill
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
i thought that she was asking about the
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
part that you keep
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.550 --> 04:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay she's nodding her head that's just
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
what she was asking but i don't
 
04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
understand how how that part would work
 
04:22:14.870 --> 04:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you're not selling it then there's no
 
04:22:14.880 --> 04:22:15.910 align:start position:0%
if you're not selling it then there's no
um

04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's just electricity you buy correct so
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative brezhney
 
04:22:29.030 --> 04:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you for introducing this bill
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on to the next
 
04:22:32.960 --> 04:22:34.389 align:start position:0%
and we'll move on to the next
presenter

04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
presenter
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
who will be griffin roberge from the new
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:54.080 --> 04:23:12.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:23:12.389 --> 04:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vos members of the
 
04:23:16.710 --> 04:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
committee for the record griffin roberge
 
04:23:17.830 --> 04:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of energy uh
 
04:23:22.710 --> 04:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
department takes a neutral position on
 
04:23:23.990 --> 04:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill but obviously wanted to
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
provide observations as we always do um
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
what was it uh i did pass around a copy
 
04:23:33.269 --> 04:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note that was generated by
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
the department you'll note that it was
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
revised as of
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
february 2nd so i understand some
 
04:23:39.990 --> 04:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee might not have
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
had a chance to review it as
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts mentioned
 
04:23:43.199 --> 04:23:44.229 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts mentioned
so

04:23:44.229 --> 04:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:45.750 --> 04:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to give everybody a chance
 
04:23:50.309 --> 04:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
i did have some discussions with the
 
04:23:53.349 --> 04:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this bill last week and
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
i very much appreciated the opportunity
 
04:23:58.950 --> 04:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
to talk with him get a sense as to
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
what his aim was what for the bill and
 
04:24:02.550 --> 04:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
everything like that
 
04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
he did ask me some questions and i will
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
follow up with him offline to get him
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
answers to those questions and obviously
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
if the committee has any questions feel
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
free to ask and i i might not have the
 
04:24:15.670 --> 04:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
answer but i can certainly follow up um
 
04:24:19.189 --> 04:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
regarding the language in this bill
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
obviously it defines default generation
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
supply service
 
04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
as the electrical energy portion of
 
04:24:26.950 --> 04:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
generation supply
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
and excludes uh other certain components
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
such as iso forward capacity market
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
payments rps compliance cost
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
administrative costs etc etc um
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
after talking uh with other staff
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
members at doe as well as you'll see
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
outlined in the fiscal note the fiscal
 
04:24:47.670 --> 04:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
note has a little bit more clarification
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
as to the obviously fiscal impact of
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
this bill but um
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
one of the main concerns i think the
 
04:24:55.830 --> 04:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
department wanted to raise is that it
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:24:59.110 --> 04:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
near impossible to exclude some of the
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
costs that are noted in this bill from
 
04:25:03.429 --> 04:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
net metering tariffs
 
04:25:05.510 --> 04:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
default service providers
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
obviously go out to bid for the power
 
04:25:09.429 --> 04:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
that they provide but the costs for that
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
are not broken out by forward capacity
 
04:25:14.550 --> 04:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
payments administrative costs supplier
 
04:25:14.560 --> 04:25:15.910 align:start position:0%
payments administrative costs supplier
profits

04:25:15.910 --> 04:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
profits
 
04:25:17.910 --> 04:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
requiring bidders to disclose the
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
various aspects of these costs would at
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
best potentially
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
slow down
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
default service biddings and auctions
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
and at worst again at worst could
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to failed default
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
service auctions
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
again as the
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee is certainly well aware by
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
this point the department is hiring a
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
con has hired a consultant and is
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
working on a
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
value of distributed energy
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh resources study that is expected to
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
be out in late spring of this year
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
again that study will give a very
 
04:25:52.239 --> 04:25:53.510 align:start position:0%
again that study will give a very
uh

04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
solid overview as to where
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
the value of these resources going
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
forward what's been done to date
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
potential cost impacts and that type of
 
04:26:01.279 --> 04:26:02.790 align:start position:0%
potential cost impacts and that type of
thing

04:26:02.790 --> 04:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:26:02.800 --> 04:26:04.309 align:start position:0%
thing
so

04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
this bill along with a couple of other
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
net metering related bills might be
 
04:26:10.389 --> 04:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
premature at this time pending the
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
outcome of that study
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm certainly willing to
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
can certainly follow up with people
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
offline if i don't have the answer for
 
04:26:22.710 --> 04:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
you today thank you
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
mr roberge for your
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
is it not true that
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
requests proprietary information from
 
04:26:38.229 --> 04:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
utilities and other sources
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
on a routine basis and keeps that
 
04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
information confidential that's correct
 
04:26:44.710 --> 04:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
in uh to further follow up on that i
 
04:26:46.469 --> 04:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
think that's what i would i didn't say
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
it explicitly but um
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's one of the concerns i guess when
 
04:26:51.110 --> 04:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
it comes into the bidding process is
 
04:26:52.630 --> 04:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
some of this information again is
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
proprietary and
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
requiring that to maybe be disclosed to
 
04:26:57.750 --> 04:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
break down
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
costs for net metering tariffs might be
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
would it be your judgment that this bill
 
04:27:07.910 --> 04:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
requires that information to be
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
disclosed in order for the commission to
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
come up with a tariff for default
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
04:27:21.600 --> 04:27:23.110 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
plett

04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
plett
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying this could not be kept in
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
camera that's a legal term which
 
04:27:27.120 --> 04:27:28.149 align:start position:0%
camera that's a legal term which
yeah

04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:27:30.149 --> 04:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
that would have to be it cannot be kept
 
04:27:31.830 --> 04:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
in camera it would have to be disclosed
 
04:27:34.309 --> 04:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
why i i apologize did you say in camera
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry i'm sorry i'm not familiar
 
04:27:37.990 --> 04:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
with the term i apologize it's a legal
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.110 --> 04:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
but i i rubbed no shoulders with
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys all around me for my career no
 
04:27:49.429 --> 04:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm just doing i mean i am
 
04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
certainly not an attorney by any stretch
 
04:27:53.110 --> 04:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
of the imagination for sure i can
 
04:27:54.550 --> 04:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
certainly offer you a more extensive
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
answer but i know when it comes to
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
auctions and bidding process and that
 
04:27:59.670 --> 04:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
type of thing
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
some costs including some of those
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
outlined in the bill are proprietary and
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
tend to be
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
obviously confidential requiring some
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
level of disclosure those costs for the
 
04:28:12.149 --> 04:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
purpose of defining these costs for the
 
04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
net metering tariff might be a bit
 
04:28:17.429 --> 04:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
problematic couldn't the utility supply
 
04:28:20.149 --> 04:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
a net cost which essentially avoided
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
cost avoiding all these other excluding
 
04:28:24.149 --> 04:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
all these other things
 
04:28:26.550 --> 04:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
and not disclose the breakdown except to
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
the puc and in camera i mean
 
04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
it could but what that what that does to
 
04:28:33.990 --> 04:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
the length of the bidding process for
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
default service auctions i couldn't
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
predict but at best again it might slow
 
04:28:40.550 --> 04:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
it down a little bit
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
and how that impacts utilities and that
 
04:28:44.309 --> 04:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
type of thing i'm sure they could speak
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
to that in greater detail
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for mr roberge
 
04:28:54.870 --> 04:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative sausage
 
04:28:56.469 --> 04:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
rubbish for taking my question
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
i notice in a fiscal note
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
you do mention that um
 
04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh this bill could has the potential
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
for reducing the cost uh
 
04:29:10.239 --> 04:29:11.030 align:start position:0%
for reducing the cost uh
uh

04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:13.269 --> 04:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour forgive me i'm sorry
 
04:29:14.550 --> 04:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
what paragraph are you looking at i
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
apologize i'm looking at the fiscal note
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
you gave us yes yes
 
04:29:20.950 --> 04:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
in that fiscal note um
 
04:29:23.110 --> 04:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that um
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill appears to reduce the per kilowatt
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
hour credit provided
 
04:29:29.910 --> 04:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
if a county or a local government
 
04:29:32.309 --> 04:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
participates blah blah blah it has the
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
potential for reducing those costs
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
but at the same time on the second part
 
04:29:39.670 --> 04:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
second page of the fiscal note says
 
04:29:41.910 --> 04:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
there is the potential that net metering
 
04:29:43.990 --> 04:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
distributed generation may reduce
 
04:29:46.469 --> 04:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
transmission costs and avoid other
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
utility costs which would reduce or
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise mitigate the impact of the
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
cost increases
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
so i assume what you're saying here is
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
there is some ambiguity whether
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
not reducing the one cost
 
04:30:02.950 --> 04:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh may may actually
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh result in some other costs being
 
04:30:07.269 --> 04:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
higher and therefore
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh mitigating
 
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
the impact of any of the decrease
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
is that what your intention was to say
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
here or what can you explain that
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
further sure and if if you'll allow me
 
04:30:19.510 --> 04:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a little awkward just
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
give me just a second just to read the
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.110 --> 04:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
sure so uh forgive me so that
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
second paragraph on the first page of
 
04:30:33.510 --> 04:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note obviously the bill is um
 
04:30:35.349 --> 04:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
defining the default service rate for
 
04:30:37.590 --> 04:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
the purposes of these tariffs to include
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
the electrical energy portion of that
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
supply but exclude these other costs so
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
in essence it's lowering the cost of the
 
04:30:48.950 --> 04:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the tariff that's given to those who
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
net meter and export to the grid um so
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
in essence you would in that paragraph
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
have a decreased in electrical costs but
 
04:30:59.030 --> 04:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
the department did also note that
 
04:30:59.040 --> 04:31:00.309 align:start position:0%
the department did also note that
um

04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:02.070 --> 04:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
a reduction in the credit provided for
 
04:31:03.990 --> 04:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
these exports you know would tend to
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
reduce electric rates you know in terms
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
and also decreasing electrical costs for
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
consumers but as you mentioned you know
 
04:31:14.070 --> 04:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
distributed energy uh generation does
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
have the potential to
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
reduce transmission costs and avoid
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
other utility costs so to the extent
 
04:31:19.760 --> 04:31:20.550 align:start position:0%
other utility costs so to the extent
that

04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:22.870 --> 04:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
this credit may disincentivize or
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
incentivize further renewable energy
 
04:31:26.710 --> 04:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
projects in the states and customer
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
generators you know that's something
 
04:31:30.630 --> 04:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
that the department noted we can't give
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
any specific numbers or anything like
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to it's hard to figure
 
04:31:33.840 --> 04:31:34.550 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to it's hard to figure
but

04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
circling back to what i had said
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
initially is that again the department
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
is working with a consultant to study
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
these issues so to look at this more
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
holistically in a study rather than a
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
kind of a piecemeal approach if you will
 
04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
further questions for mr roberge
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative oxenoum
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
we heard this morning from mr cliff
 
04:32:03.189 --> 04:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
below that there's uh net metering was
 
04:32:07.110 --> 04:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
rough justice that you know your
 
04:32:09.030 --> 04:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
the entire system benefits from avoided
 
04:32:10.630 --> 04:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
but for the 2.0 customers which are a
 
04:32:13.199 --> 04:32:14.309 align:start position:0%
but for the 2.0 customers which are a
subset

04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
subset
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
there is this missing money issue
 
04:32:18.149 --> 04:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
and that to a certain extent they cancel
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
each other out
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
you you've raised some other issues
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
i i think this really goes
 
04:32:29.910 --> 04:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i know this has to be a question but
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
for for clarity's purposes
 
04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
you you
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
is it not the case
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
that this is why we have professional
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
regulators who understand the
 
04:32:43.110 --> 04:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
complexities of tariff
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
and why the doe hired a consultant so
 
04:32:49.110 --> 04:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
that all of these there are many
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
interacting components some go take it
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
up some take it down
 
04:32:57.750 --> 04:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
to try to pick out one element or as
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
this one does to cut in half the default
 
04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
service rate um
 
04:33:05.670 --> 04:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
i think i think
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
i think what you suggested was that it
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
was premature did i i think i heard i
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
is that your question
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
that was the clarification i was looking
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
for so thank you very much i i have i
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
have a further question but i think it's
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
better for the utilities we so often
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
hear that these changes that we suggest
 
04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
make difficulties for the utilities in
 
04:33:29.439 --> 04:33:30.709 align:start position:0%
make difficulties for the utilities in
their

04:33:30.709 --> 04:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
ability to assign rates that things are
 
04:33:35.349 --> 04:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
done by hand they're not even automated
 
04:33:35.359 --> 04:33:36.551 align:start position:0%
done by hand they're not even automated
systems

04:33:36.551 --> 04:33:36.561 align:start position:0%
systems
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
that we could be increasing the cost in
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
ways that are entirely outside of this
 
04:33:43.029 --> 04:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
purview but they are cost to our
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
utilities which would then be passed on
 
04:33:45.199 --> 04:33:46.150 align:start position:0%
utilities which would then be passed on
to

04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh customers ratepayers
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
04:33:52.230 --> 04:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh in response to the question i thought
 
04:33:53.510 --> 04:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
it was going to be a lot more difficult
 
04:33:55.750 --> 04:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to ask me to respond to
 
04:33:57.429 --> 04:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
substantial things that cliff below
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned and there's no way you can
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
manage that uh i wouldn't do that too in
 
04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
any case uh you know
 
04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
circling back to how i answered
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative sanchez again you know
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
the study will will be comprehensive
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
look at all of these factors and provide
 
04:34:12.551 --> 04:34:12.561 align:start position:0%
policy makers as well as stakeholders
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
who are involved in the docker process
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
as well as state agencies um you know
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
guidance on you know the value of
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources in the
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
state it's kind of focused solely on you
 
04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire not what
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is doing maine is doing
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
all those other things um
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
you know obviously we the department you
 
04:34:30.709 --> 04:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
know takes direction from policymakers
 
04:34:32.789 --> 04:34:32.799 align:start position:0%
such as yourselves but you know
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:34:35.990 --> 04:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
states want to obviously be sure that
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
policymakers are fully informed of you
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
know the the proposals that they bring
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
why i'm here today
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so representative callie pitts
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
all of us on this committee and i i i'm
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
going to be i'm going to take the
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
liberty and ex
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
talk for all of us are concerned about
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
electricity rates
 
04:35:00.959 --> 04:35:02.470 align:start position:0%
electricity rates
however

04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
just confirm for me
 
04:35:07.910 --> 04:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
that all these inclusive things in this
 
04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
rate in this default service
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
was approved by the puc after an
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
extensive docket and formula
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
compilations would you confirm that this
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
is not willy-nilly sure but i mean
 
04:35:23.349 --> 04:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
that's different for every utility in a
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
different rate case and ever and
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
everything like that yes
 
04:35:30.869 --> 04:35:30.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh one other question for you your
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note says that state counties and
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
local governments
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
are likely to experience decreased
 
04:35:43.189 --> 04:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
expenditures for electricity due to this
 
04:35:43.199 --> 04:35:43.990 align:start position:0%
expenditures for electricity due to this
bill

04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
and it also says that
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
it would in turn decrease electricity
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
costs for consumers
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
so the department is
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
right reasonably sure that this bill
 
04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
would indeed lower costs for consumers
 
04:35:59.439 --> 04:36:00.789 align:start position:0%
would indeed lower costs for consumers
and

04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
municipal and county governments
 
04:36:04.629 --> 04:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
yes we recognize the potential for that
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
because again we're separating out for
 
04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
the purposes of net metering tariffs for
 
04:36:11.189 --> 04:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
the default service rate we are at least
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
as this bill defines it we are defining
 
04:36:14.789 --> 04:36:14.799 align:start position:0%
that rate as including the electrical
 
04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
energy portion of that supply but
 
04:36:19.029 --> 04:36:19.039 align:start position:0%
excluding these other costs so by
 
04:36:21.189 --> 04:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
excluding those other costs you are in
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%
essence decreasing
 
04:36:22.959 --> 04:36:23.670 align:start position:0%
essence decreasing
the

04:36:23.670 --> 04:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:25.349 --> 04:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
the default service rate that's included
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the tariff which in essence reduces
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
the tariff or the credit that's given
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
the customer generators which in turn
 
04:36:34.470 --> 04:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
would reduce energy costs a lot of
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
steps there but yes
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay thanks for clarifying that
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
all right so you know oh there's one
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
more representative mcgee a further
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
clarification did you not also mentioned
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that there was a potential for uh
 
04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
failed default service freight auctions
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
that i did mention that at the outset
 
04:36:53.039 --> 04:36:54.470 align:start position:0%
that i did mention that at the outset
correct

04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:36:54.480 --> 04:36:55.269 align:start position:0%
correct
so

04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:57.109 --> 04:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
so we would be
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
04:37:00.070 --> 04:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
lower electric bills at the rate of
 
04:37:02.470 --> 04:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
destabilizing the system i think i think
 
04:37:04.230 --> 04:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
again circling back to what
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative flett had mentioned and
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'll certainly like to follow up with
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
the committee and get more clearly on
 
04:37:09.990 --> 04:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality of some of these
 
04:37:13.510 --> 04:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
costs but um requiring a breakdown of
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
all these costs in default service bids
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
again at best would prolong the bidding
 
04:37:21.910 --> 04:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
process at worst could potentially lead
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
to failed auctions
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:25.439 --> 04:37:26.949 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:29.830 --> 04:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions mr roberge
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
we thank you for testifying
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
and i would like to call on our next
 
04:37:34.799 --> 04:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
and i would like to call on our next
testifier

04:37:36.390 --> 04:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
testifier
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
who is
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
joseph kwosnik
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
of concord representing himself
 
04:37:54.310 --> 04:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:55.910 --> 04:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr sherman thank you to the
 
04:37:57.990 --> 04:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to testify
 
04:37:58.000 --> 04:37:59.750 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to testify
today

04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
as i testified this morning in the
 
04:38:02.551 --> 04:38:02.561 align:start position:0%
previous bill i'm a founding member of
 
04:38:04.150 --> 04:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire network
 
04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
and former chairman of new hampshire
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
electric cooperative and a retired
 
04:38:10.150 --> 04:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
environmental executive in national grid
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
i am today submitting written cop
 
04:38:13.869 --> 04:38:13.879 align:start position:0%
testimony in opposition to house bill
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
1629 my reasons for posing the bill is
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
as follows
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
one is the bill seems to exclude with
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
the exception of the electrical energy
 
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
portion of default generation supply
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
service all of the ancillary components
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
of supply such as iso forward capacity
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
market payments
 
04:38:31.109 --> 04:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard costs
 
04:38:32.949 --> 04:38:32.959 align:start position:0%
administrative costs supplier costs and
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
other non-electrical
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh components as determined by the
 
04:38:36.240 --> 04:38:38.070 align:start position:0%
uh components as determined by the
commission

04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
and i think we as we spoke about this
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
morning in june of 2017 the puc
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
established uh net metering tariffs that
 
04:38:46.629 --> 04:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
are currently in effect these tariffs
 
04:38:48.869 --> 04:38:48.879 align:start position:0%
were considered appropriate in that they
 
04:38:50.869 --> 04:38:50.879 align:start position:0%
avoided any unjust or unreasonable cost
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
shifting between customer classes
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
the current net metering tariff properly
 
04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
credits the exportation electricity from
 
04:39:00.789 --> 04:39:00.799 align:start position:0%
small systems up to 100 kw and includes
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
the value of default service
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
transmission 25 percent of distribution
 
04:39:08.150 --> 04:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
for large systems between 100 kw and 1
 
04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
megawatt compensation for export is at
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
the value
 
04:39:13.990 --> 04:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
of default service only
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
because the puc is currently studying
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
the value of distributed energy
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
resources under the vder program
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i don't misspell
 
04:39:25.910 --> 04:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
misspell that the vder program and will
 
04:39:27.670 --> 04:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
be expected to make future adjustments
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
to the net metering credits as necessary
 
04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
to avoid cost shifting this study is
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
expected in the spring thus making any
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislative changes premature
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
it also seems to be
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
excuse my language a quote unquote a
 
04:39:44.070 --> 04:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
backdoor to minimize compensation to net
 
04:39:44.080 --> 04:39:45.190 align:start position:0%
backdoor to minimize compensation to net
metered

04:39:45.190 --> 04:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
metered
 
04:39:47.430 --> 04:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
customer generators in new hampshire the
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
bill essentially mandates compensation
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
to net metered customer generators at
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
essentially wholesale rates this is
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and fails to recognize the
 
04:39:57.190 --> 04:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
system benefits and value of net
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
metering and i just make a note that
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
prior bills in before this this
 
04:40:02.868 --> 04:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
committee in in prior sessions of the
 
04:40:05.670 --> 04:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
legislature have tried to actually um
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
bring down the compensation to metering
 
04:40:08.708 --> 04:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
two wholesale rates and those have
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
failed in the past and this is
 
04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
essentially uh a bill that is trying to
 
04:40:14.868 --> 04:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh the bill
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
inappropriately interferes with the
 
04:40:19.750 --> 04:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
current default generation supply
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
definition including its ancillary
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
components and prejudges the outcome of
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
the puc vder study it should not pass
 
04:40:28.628 --> 04:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
and should be determined to be an
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislature legislate
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
04:40:35.510 --> 04:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
i would take questions
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
okay questions for mr kwasnik
 
04:40:41.110 --> 04:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman and
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kwasnik for taking my
 
04:40:44.560 --> 04:40:45.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kwasnik for taking my
question

04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
um i can remember in past sessions that
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
we've had people come to speak to us
 
04:40:50.320 --> 04:40:51.270 align:start position:0%
we've had people come to speak to us
about

04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh the value of distributed energy
 
04:40:55.670 --> 04:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
in other places in the region and i'm
 
04:40:57.750 --> 04:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
just curious we're not the only state
 
04:41:00.628 --> 04:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
that's undertaken trying to look at
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
what the value of these resources are
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you had any
 
04:41:04.240 --> 04:41:07.590 align:start position:0%
and i was wondering if you had any
information

04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
of how that's come out in other places
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
because i know we've seen evidence in
 
04:41:13.030 --> 04:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
the past
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware i'm sure there have been
 
04:41:16.470 --> 04:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
studies in other states within the new
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
england area because i think they're a
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
little bit beheaded of us in terms of
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
the actual implementation of these
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
regulations and these these laws i do
 
04:41:26.788 --> 04:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
know that in the state of new hampshire
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
with my experience with the electric
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
co-op is that back about five years ago
 
04:41:33.990 --> 04:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
the question of the value of renewable
 
04:41:36.550 --> 04:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
energy and net metering came up before
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the board of the new hampshire
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
electric co-op and the staff at
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
co-op was
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
asked to actually consider what the
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
benefits and costs
 
04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
to the system were for net metering
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
and the co-op actually came up with a
 
04:41:50.948 --> 04:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
number that was slightly different than
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
the default but very close to it and
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
their belief staff belief was that the
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
default rates that are applicable to the
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
other i o
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
investor owned utilities in new
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire are pretty close to what
 
04:42:05.110 --> 04:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
what the value of renewable energy and
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
that metering is in the state so i think
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
their research and i don't have it in
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
front of me it was something that's done
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
five or six years ago was that the the
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
rates that were that net metering uh
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
sources get today are pretty fair
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
for both the customers and for the
 
04:42:22.628 --> 04:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
generator thank you
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sausage has a
 
04:42:24.878 --> 04:42:26.070 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sausage has a
question

04:42:26.070 --> 04:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
kwasnik for being here
 
04:42:29.280 --> 04:42:31.190 align:start position:0%
kwasnik for being here
um

04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
if if we were to uh
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
with this bill reduce the the price down
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
to the wholesale price
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned
 
04:42:41.200 --> 04:42:42.470 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned
um

04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
are all wholesale
 
04:42:46.708 --> 04:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
energy units equal
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
is there no quality difference between
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
whether i generate
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
one unit of energy with coal versus one
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
university with solar
 
04:42:58.470 --> 04:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert in the market but a
 
04:43:00.150 --> 04:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
wholesale price is whatever the market
 
04:43:01.830 --> 04:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
will is offering
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
a megawatt hour at and it can vary from
 
04:43:06.628 --> 04:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
day to day from minute to minute and
 
04:43:09.750 --> 04:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
from month to month so uh and there may
 
04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
be some value in some priority payments
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
for various generation that is of higher
 
04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
quality such as renewables and things of
 
04:43:19.030 --> 04:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
that sort well
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me follow up follow up well i i
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
was just
 
04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
wanting to ask you whether
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
what are those qualitative differences
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
04:43:30.788 --> 04:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
could you comment on what qualitative
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
differences there might be between one
 
04:43:35.910 --> 04:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
energy source versus another sure
 
04:43:37.830 --> 04:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
i do know that in the report
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
the rps market not just in new hampshire
 
04:43:42.628 --> 04:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
but in other new england states is that
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
there is various
 
04:43:46.470 --> 04:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
payments premium payments paid for what
 
04:43:48.948 --> 04:43:48.958 align:start position:0%
call higher quality renewables that many
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
cases have diverted renewables renewable
 
04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
wrecks from our state to other states
 
04:43:55.510 --> 04:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
like connecticut such as some of the
 
04:43:55.520 --> 04:43:56.708 align:start position:0%
like connecticut such as some of the
um

04:43:56.708 --> 04:43:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
i think some of the the solar wrecks
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
have actually been siphoned off from our
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
state to those other states but yeah
 
04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's some quality difference in terms
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
of regeneration um but again it's it's
 
04:44:09.190 --> 04:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the market the market makes it makes
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
a determination of what those rates will
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
be on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour
 
04:44:12.718 --> 04:44:14.470 align:start position:0%
be on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour
basis

04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
basis
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
04:44:19.110 --> 04:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you mentioned in your
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
testimony that this bill would tamper
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the definition of the default
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
service rate that's correct where in
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
statute is the default service rate
 
04:44:27.360 --> 04:44:28.470 align:start position:0%
statute is the default service rate
defined

04:44:28.470 --> 04:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
defined
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about where it's defined in
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.830 --> 04:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
in rsa
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
362-a semicolon 9 there's a definition
 
04:44:40.708 --> 04:44:40.718 align:start position:0%
of default service there
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
and that was i was referring to can can
 
04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
you point me to that language
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
um i'd have to go back to my chair but i
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
think it's right in the opening
 
04:44:50.230 --> 04:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph of that rsa
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
04:44:52.080 --> 04:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
pitts

04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of uh
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
words that
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
over the years to me have been red flag
 
04:45:00.480 --> 04:45:01.510 align:start position:0%
over the years to me have been red flag
words

04:45:01.510 --> 04:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
words
 
04:45:01.520 --> 04:45:02.868 align:start position:0%
words
may

04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:45:02.878 --> 04:45:05.350 align:start position:0%
may
could

04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:05.360 --> 04:45:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:45:06.310 --> 04:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:08.070 --> 04:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
that are not positive and in the
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
statement from mr roberge we had
 
04:45:14.948 --> 04:45:14.958 align:start position:0%
one of the red flags
 
04:45:17.670 --> 04:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
that when we do this it could reduce the
 
04:45:19.830 --> 04:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
amount of future development of
 
04:45:22.070 --> 04:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
facilities in other words customer
 
04:45:22.080 --> 04:45:23.190 align:start position:0%
facilities in other words customer
generators

04:45:23.190 --> 04:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
generators
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
i i guess i do believe that to be true
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
if indeed
 
04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
when you remove all these ancillary
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
components from the default
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
generation supply service
 
04:45:40.390 --> 04:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
and you're getting down close to well
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
called wholesale rates
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
many of these
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
net metered customer generators will
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
choose not to install these facilities
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
and also the question is will they tend
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
to keep will they renew them when their
 
04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
useful life is up i i think you'll see a
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
lot of net meeting metering say solar
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
folks as they get to the end of the life
 
04:46:01.110 --> 04:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
of their components if they're being
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
paid at this lower rate they will not
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
tend to
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
replace those those systems
 
04:46:08.788 --> 04:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
so it's the problem of replacement but
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
also initial installation too will be
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
much chilled in the state
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
my view may i follow follow-up
 
04:46:19.030 --> 04:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up would be do you believe
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
that these future developments
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
could have more value
 
04:46:25.990 --> 04:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
in them
 
04:46:28.070 --> 04:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
than the small and i believe it would be
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
a small amount of money and
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not talking about pennies but i'm
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
not talking about hundreds of millions
 
04:46:34.878 --> 04:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
not talking about hundreds of millions
either

04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
either
 
04:46:37.750 --> 04:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh do you believe that these future
 
04:46:37.760 --> 04:46:39.430 align:start position:0%
uh do you believe that these future
developments

04:46:39.430 --> 04:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
developments
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
could be worth more
 
04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
than what we may return
 
04:46:44.958 --> 04:46:47.270 align:start position:0%
than what we may return
now

04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of net metered
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
generating resources i believe that
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
this resources such as solar wind and
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
other renewable sources will become more
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
valuable in the future especially as we
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
find that we are going to be carbon
 
04:47:01.600 --> 04:47:02.788 align:start position:0%
find that we are going to be carbon
constrained

04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
constrained
 
04:47:04.550 --> 04:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the next 10 to 20 years which i think
 
04:47:04.560 --> 04:47:05.510 align:start position:0%
in the next 10 to 20 years which i think
will

04:47:05.510 --> 04:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:47:08.470 --> 04:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
will occur within our economy so those
 
04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
resources will become much more valuable
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
the the resources that are more fossil
 
04:47:12.480 --> 04:47:13.990 align:start position:0%
the the resources that are more fossil
based

04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
based
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
coal which is
 
04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
almost gone
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
and also even natural gas even though
 
04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's a lower carbon emitting sources
 
04:47:22.070 --> 04:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a zero carbon emitting source
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
so i think they'll become less valuable
 
04:47:25.750 --> 04:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the future when we get into carbon
 
04:47:28.550 --> 04:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
constraint economy
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
 
04:47:32.550 --> 04:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question mr kwasnik
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
20 years ago the wholesale market was
 
04:47:40.390 --> 04:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
created we had the re-regulation uh
 
04:47:42.628 --> 04:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
generations split off from
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh the utilities
 
04:47:47.350 --> 04:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
and it was a competitive market
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
and ever since then i've seen
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
states undermining that market with
 
04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
subsidies for this and that and aren't
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
these subsidies it was a generator in
 
04:47:58.550 --> 04:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
the open market for electricity gets
 
04:47:58.560 --> 04:48:00.708 align:start position:0%
the open market for electricity gets
paid

04:48:00.708 --> 04:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
paid
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
locational marginal price essentially
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
the raw energy price period now they get
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
paid for other things or they provide
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
other services but by providing more
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
than that to customer generators are we
 
04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
slowly undermining that market
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
i think we should be very careful when
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
we start to talk about subsidies to
 
04:48:20.550 --> 04:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
these particular sources because if you
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
go back into the supply chain whether
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's a gas or oil or even coal
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
there are subsidized subsidizations in
 
04:48:28.718 --> 04:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
there are subsidized subsidizations in
those

04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
producing processes so
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not prepared today to really say
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
what's the right balance but it's it's
 
04:48:37.910 --> 04:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
you would have to tease out all the
 
04:48:39.910 --> 04:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
subsidies that are in the supply chain
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:47.040 --> 04:48:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:48:50.070 --> 04:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
we thank you you've had your two
 
04:48:50.080 --> 04:48:51.270 align:start position:0%
we thank you you've had your two
questions

04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
and we have to move on because we have
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
several more people and we're running
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
out of time
 
04:48:55.920 --> 04:48:56.948 align:start position:0%
out of time
so

04:48:56.948 --> 04:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:58.868 --> 04:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr kwasnik for your testimony
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
and i would now call on ian oxenom
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
who is representing himself from
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
plainfield new hampshire
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll alert
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine that it might be
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest for you to ask
 
04:49:16.150 --> 04:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
questions of this
 
04:49:16.160 --> 04:49:17.830 align:start position:0%
questions of this
testifier

04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
testifier
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:40.160 --> 04:49:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm ian oxum
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm a licensed new hampshire attorney i
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
also have a degree in math and energy
 
04:49:50.070 --> 04:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
regulation and law and this is an area i
 
04:49:51.510 --> 04:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
practiced and i wanted to submit some
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
testimony to
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
correct what i feel are some faulty
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
factual premises this bill is based on
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
as the
 
04:50:01.670 --> 04:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
i go into more detail in my written
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
testimony but in the interest of time
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
i'll probably just try to be a bit more
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
brief in what i have here
 
04:50:06.958 --> 04:50:07.750 align:start position:0%
brief in what i have here
my

04:50:07.750 --> 04:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
first thing i really want to make
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
clear is that when a net meter generator
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
exports energy to the vocal distribution
 
04:50:15.760 --> 04:50:16.708 align:start position:0%
exports energy to the vocal distribution
system

04:50:16.708 --> 04:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
they are avoiding far more than just the
 
04:50:21.590 --> 04:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
raw electricity costs the idea that
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
there are not avoided capacity costs or
 
04:50:25.670 --> 04:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
avoided ancillary costs
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
is simply false and there's several
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
reasons for this one
 
04:50:32.550 --> 04:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
when a utility arranges to provide
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
default services customers it goes to
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
supplier and that supplier bundles that
 
04:50:39.510 --> 04:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
all into a single per unit price and so
 
04:50:39.520 --> 04:50:40.310 align:start position:0%
all into a single per unit price and so
when

04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that's usually somewhere around the
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
range of 8 cents per kilowatt hour when
 
04:50:46.868 --> 04:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
a customer generator exports energy to
 
04:50:46.878 --> 04:50:47.590 align:start position:0%
a customer generator exports energy to
the

04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
distribution grid that reduces on a per
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
unit basis the amount of energy that
 
04:50:54.550 --> 04:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
supplier has to deliver and thus for the
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
utility avoids basically eight cents on
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
the default service component i'm not
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
gonna go into distribution and
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
transmission just individual simplicity
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
because i think that's also beyond the
 
04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill
 
04:51:06.070 --> 04:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
and two these are actually avoid costs
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
for that supplier as well because iso
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
any bills the supply of ancillary costs
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
based on how much
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
energy gets delivered to that wholesale
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
meter point and capacity costs are based
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
on coincident peak demand and i want to
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
be very clear
 
04:51:22.550 --> 04:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
that even though solar is not a firm
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
resource io soleni has been very
 
04:51:26.788 --> 04:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
carefully has very carefully calculated
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that it has reduced
 
04:51:31.590 --> 04:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
peak the demand speaks sum of demand in
 
04:51:33.910 --> 04:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
new england by over 800 megawatt
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
megawatts and it has a reduced capacity
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
cost and the market simply from that by
 
04:51:41.110 --> 04:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
at least tens of millions of dollars and
 
04:51:43.030 --> 04:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
when you factor in how it has suppressed
 
04:51:44.470 --> 04:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
the craving price on the floor capacity
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
market solar has probably reduced
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
capacity costs in the wholesale market
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
region wide by hundreds of millions of
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
dollars per year so the idea that solar
 
04:51:56.310 --> 04:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
exports the grid are only avoiding raw
 
04:51:58.948 --> 04:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
electricity costs is demonstrably false
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
from a factual position from a factual
 
04:52:01.280 --> 04:52:02.470 align:start position:0%
from a factual position from a factual
standpoint

04:52:02.470 --> 04:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
and i really want to be clear that most
 
04:52:06.628 --> 04:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
of these costs that there are including
 
04:52:08.550 --> 04:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
default service that we that i think the
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor assumed
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh were not being avoided by solar
 
04:52:15.190 --> 04:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
exports actually all being avoided by
 
04:52:17.510 --> 04:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
solar exports to the distribution grid
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
and i want to make that very clear today
 
04:52:20.788 --> 04:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
that as a result of this if this bill to
 
04:52:22.830 --> 04:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
go forward what you would have is a
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
situation in which the customer
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
generator is being compensated at a far
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
less rate than the cost they are
 
04:52:30.550 --> 04:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
actually avoiding for the utility and
 
04:52:32.150 --> 04:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
you basically have a situation where the
 
04:52:34.550 --> 04:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
customer generators will be charged for
 
04:52:36.550 --> 04:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
default recharge more for their default
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
service than the cost of actually
 
04:52:39.750 --> 04:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
providing them with default service on a
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
net basis and so i would argue that as a
 
04:52:42.000 --> 04:52:43.030 align:start position:0%
net basis and so i would argue that as a
punitive

04:52:43.030 --> 04:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
punitive
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
uh rates that are two customer
 
04:52:46.150 --> 04:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
generators that do not reflect cost
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
causation and that's why this bill
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
these things are inexp valued in the
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
proceeding we was mentioned
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
on in the vdo
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
vder value stack and this study's broken
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
up they are explicitly looking at the
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
avoided capacity and avoid ancillary
 
04:53:04.708 --> 04:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
service costs and we should really let
 
04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
that process play out to determine what
 
04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
they are but and as the previous speaker
 
04:53:08.480 --> 04:53:09.430 align:start position:0%
they are but and as the previous speaker
mentioned

04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
co-op also found that basically the
 
04:53:14.550 --> 04:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
avoided costs are pretty close to
 
04:53:16.390 --> 04:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
default service costs on the angie side
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're happy to pay that
 
04:53:19.590 --> 04:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
and this similar thing has happened with
 
04:53:21.750 --> 04:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
community power aggregations
 
04:53:23.350 --> 04:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
that the dropped language in the
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
template for community power templates
 
04:53:27.030 --> 04:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
how they're going to handle net metering
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
is they're going to pay the full energy
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
service rate they don't that does not
 
04:53:31.990 --> 04:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
include transmission distribution
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
because that's still handled by the
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
utilities but the draft language is free
 
04:53:37.510 --> 04:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
of any legal requirement
 
04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
they are going to pay the full energy
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
service weight for exports that they
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
they charge to the customer generator
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
because that is a fairly accurate
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
reflection of the cost they will
 
04:53:49.030 --> 04:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
actually avoid the community power
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
aggregations and that is free of any
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
legal compulsion
 
04:53:53.270 --> 04:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
and because they do not because they do
 
04:53:55.030 --> 04:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
not view the subsidy they view that as a
 
04:53:56.788 --> 04:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
roughly accurate
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
value for what the customer generator is
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
exporting and so i believe this bill has
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
been based on a faulty factual premise
 
04:54:05.350 --> 04:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
and for that reason should be ruled in
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
experience of legislate and i go into
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
more detail in my written testimony
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are you willing to take
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
questions yes yes i am okay
 
04:54:16.150 --> 04:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative platt has a question
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you yes i'm aware of isil new
 
04:54:20.150 --> 04:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
england's practice of adjusting demand
 
04:54:20.160 --> 04:54:20.868 align:start position:0%
england's practice of adjusting demand
for

04:54:20.868 --> 04:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
the impact of this stuff
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
but what obligation does any net meter
 
04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
have to provide at peak time as opposed
 
04:54:30.550 --> 04:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
to a generator which gets paid for that
 
04:54:30.560 --> 04:54:32.230 align:start position:0%
to a generator which gets paid for that
service

04:54:32.230 --> 04:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
they do not they do not have an
 
04:54:35.590 --> 04:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
obligation but they nonetheless provide
 
04:54:36.788 --> 04:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
the service
 
04:54:39.750 --> 04:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
they and because as they as i saw he's
 
04:54:43.270 --> 04:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
calculated solar has reduced as of 2020
 
04:54:45.910 --> 04:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
it was about 800 megawatt reduction and
 
04:54:48.628 --> 04:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
if you simply multiply that by the
 
04:54:49.990 --> 04:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
current place in terms of how much
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
capacity costs avoided you get about 50
 
04:54:53.430 --> 04:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars and i think it's even
 
04:54:55.110 --> 04:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
more once you factor in how that has
 
04:54:57.910 --> 04:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
suppressed wholesale cooling prices so
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
though they have no obligation to do it
 
04:55:02.230 --> 04:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
they are providing the value of avoiding
 
04:55:04.708 --> 04:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh capacity costs the thing is that from
 
04:55:06.868 --> 04:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
iso andy's point of view they are they
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
aren't acting as a supplier they're
 
04:55:10.708 --> 04:55:10.718 align:start position:0%
acting as a load reducer they're simply
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of load the
 
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
centralized system has to serve which
 
04:55:16.948 --> 04:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
means less centralized system less which
 
04:55:19.030 --> 04:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
means less central generation capacity
 
04:55:21.190 --> 04:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
has to be procured in order to meet peak
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
summer demand which creates cost savings
 
04:55:26.230 --> 04:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
for the entire system and has reduced
 
04:55:28.150 --> 04:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
capacity costs that everywhere pay a new
 
04:55:29.990 --> 04:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
grant has paid by tens if not hundreds
 
04:55:34.470 --> 04:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
04:55:39.190 --> 04:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:55:42.550 --> 04:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr oxnam for being here um so
 
04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
if i understand your your your
 
04:55:46.948 --> 04:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
appeal here
 
04:55:48.788 --> 04:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
a net meter uh
 
04:55:54.638 --> 04:55:56.070 align:start position:0%
a net meter uh
generator

04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
generator
 
04:55:58.708 --> 04:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh when it provides energy into the grid
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is a load reducer
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
and therefore being a load reducer the
 
04:56:07.110 --> 04:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
amount of load it's reducing
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
that is the avoided cost of the utility
 
04:56:12.310 --> 04:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
that now doesn't have to provide that
 
04:56:12.320 --> 04:56:13.670 align:start position:0%
that now doesn't have to provide that
energy

04:56:13.670 --> 04:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
they should be equally compensated at
 
04:56:20.708 --> 04:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
the same rate otherwise the utility
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
would be making money off of someone
 
04:56:24.550 --> 04:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
who's generating their own energy is
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
that correct essentially correct there
 
04:56:28.150 --> 04:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
is true that on the distribution side it
 
04:56:30.310 --> 04:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
gets a bit more complicated because the
 
04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
is still going on the distribution grid
 
04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
so you can argue the utility is still
 
04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
including some cost on the distribution
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
system but it is definitely avoiding
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
energy and transmission costs
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
including the energy costs i mean
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
inclusive of capacity and ancillary
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
service and also supplier profit because
 
04:56:47.910 --> 04:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
like i said before
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
when you export to distribution grid
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
that kilowatt hour goes to someplace
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
else on that same distribution grid
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
which means you've reduced the amount of
 
04:56:56.150 --> 04:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
the number of kilowatt hours that have
 
04:56:57.030 --> 04:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
to be imported from the bulk
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
transmission system which means the
 
04:57:00.550 --> 04:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
supplier delivers less energy which
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
means the supplier charges less and that
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
is how you have a situation where
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much the the full default service
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
cost may be exclusive within the rps
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
compliance costs
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
is avoided by that exports the grid and
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
also due to other reasons of how rps
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
compliance costs work usually most
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
exports from that media generators also
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
avoid rps compliance costs for other
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
reasons but i don't have time to get
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
into that today
 
04:57:26.230 --> 04:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question yes
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
oxenam for taking my question
 
04:57:34.080 --> 04:57:35.990 align:start position:0%
oxenam for taking my question
um

04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me my summary of what
 
04:57:40.470 --> 04:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that you're saying this
 
04:57:42.070 --> 04:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't achieve what it seeks to
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
achieve because i did ask the sponsor
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
what he was trying to achieve with this
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
which was really right-sizing these
 
04:57:50.788 --> 04:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
costs and uh thinking that he was doing
 
04:57:52.948 --> 04:57:52.958 align:start position:0%
something to help save people money
 
04:57:55.350 --> 04:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
and it sounds from your testimony and i
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate you giving us some
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
measurable pieces here
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
that we were able to jot down so that we
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding but
 
04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like what you're saying
 
04:58:07.590 --> 04:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
is that the bill wouldn't achieve those
 
04:58:10.390 --> 04:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
ends because it wouldn't it would
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
it would be quantifying something that
 
04:58:14.470 --> 04:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
isn't accurate in terms of how the
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
system's actually operating
 
04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
i think that that's mostly what i'm
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
trying to say
 
04:58:22.628 --> 04:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
more specifically though what i think is
 
04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
the bill is trying to achieve a the
 
04:58:26.948 --> 04:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of compensation for
 
04:58:29.990 --> 04:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
net metering but due to a faulty factual
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
premise it the sponsor is assuming that
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
value is far less than it actually is
 
04:58:37.030 --> 04:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
because and i really
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't blame people for this because
 
04:58:42.230 --> 04:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
this is something even as a trained
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer someone with a specific degree in
 
04:58:44.480 --> 04:58:45.350 align:start position:0%
lawyer someone with a specific degree in
this

04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
it takes me a while to figure out
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
exactly how the money flows who avoids
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
this and so i'm not all surprised that
 
04:58:54.390 --> 04:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
this factual mistake was made but i just
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to correct it because i think the
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
goal should be
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
to compensate uh solar for the costs it
 
04:59:04.150 --> 04:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
avoids and but and if you're only
 
04:59:05.990 --> 04:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
compensating it for avoided low energy
 
04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
costs you are far f compensated far far
 
04:59:10.310 --> 04:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
less than the cost that is actually
 
04:59:11.670 --> 04:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
avoided when you're putting an extra
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour onto a distribution grid
 
04:59:16.390 --> 04:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the bulk transmission grid
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
and so i believe the sponsor was well
 
04:59:20.150 --> 04:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
intentioned and trying to evaluate
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately but he was
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
operating on a faulty factual premise
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you uh we'd like to
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
move on we have two more people who
 
04:59:31.270 --> 04:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
would like to testify we appreciate you
 
04:59:33.030 --> 04:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
being here mr oxenam thank you for
 
04:59:33.990 --> 04:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
hearing me
 
04:59:35.750 --> 04:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i would like to call now on kelly
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
buchanan of clean energy new hampshire
 
04:59:46.708 --> 04:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair i have
 
05:00:03.750 --> 05:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:05.670 --> 05:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
all right for the record my name is
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
kelly buchanan i'm director of
 
05:00:09.190 --> 05:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
legislative and regulatory affairs at
 
05:00:11.190 --> 05:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today before you in strong
 
05:00:16.708 --> 05:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
opposition of house bill 1629
 
05:00:17.990 --> 05:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons that have
 
05:00:19.750 --> 05:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
already been discussed so i will be
 
05:00:19.760 --> 05:00:20.948 align:start position:0%
already been discussed so i will be
brief

05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
brief
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
but as a brief history lesson on the
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
general court in 2016 passed house bill
 
05:00:25.520 --> 05:00:27.030 align:start position:0%
general court in 2016 passed house bill
1116

05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
1116
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
which tests the public utilities
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
commission with developing an
 
05:00:31.990 --> 05:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
alternative net metering tariff
 
05:00:34.230 --> 05:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
and so within that docket they took a
 
05:00:36.390 --> 05:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
look at the tariff and issued an order
 
05:00:39.670 --> 05:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
in 2017 to set the net metering tariffs
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
as they currently are and so in
 
05:00:43.830 --> 05:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
improving these tariffs the puc found
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
that they were appropriate
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that the puc is
 
05:00:50.550 --> 05:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
consid continuing to study
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh the value of distributed energy
 
05:00:54.788 --> 05:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
resources and will make the appropriate
 
05:00:56.550 --> 05:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
changes to the alternative net metering
 
05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
tariff if they find that's necessary and
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
i want to highlight for the committee
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
today the importance of the stakeholder
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
process that's been going on in that
 
05:01:04.480 --> 05:01:05.750 align:start position:0%
process that's been going on in that
docket

05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
docket
 
05:01:07.350 --> 05:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's one of our larger dockets that
 
05:01:09.270 --> 05:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
we've been working on and it's been in
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
effect since 2016.
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
and for context i was still working on
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
my undergraduate degree in 2016. so it's
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
been a while
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
but we find that this study process
 
05:01:20.788 --> 05:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
really brings together all the
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate information
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
as well as some really technical and
 
05:01:24.480 --> 05:01:25.590 align:start position:0%
as well as some really technical and
valuable

05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
resources that the department of energy
 
05:01:30.150 --> 05:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
has invested in as well as the puc and
 
05:01:32.708 --> 05:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
so we find that house bill 1629 is
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
premature and because we expect that
 
05:01:37.350 --> 05:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
study to be completed so quickly in the
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
spring we would really urge the
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
05:01:43.350 --> 05:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
be patient and to examine that study
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
which will perhaps enlighten many of the
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
questions that have been asked here
 
05:01:46.878 --> 05:01:48.390 align:start position:0%
questions that have been asked here
today

05:01:48.390 --> 05:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:01:49.990 --> 05:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
briefly i'll just highlight that we are
 
05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
also concerned that house bill 1629
 
05:01:54.948 --> 05:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
would negatively and abruptly impact the
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
current and future economics of
 
05:01:58.550 --> 05:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources in new
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire all without taking into
 
05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
account the information in that study in
 
05:02:05.030 --> 05:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
the veda study so
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
finally i'll end with that we find that
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
it is most appropriate to consider any
 
05:02:11.830 --> 05:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
changes to tariffs in the regulatory
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
environment at the public utilities
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
commission where those matters can be
 
05:02:17.750 --> 05:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately adjudicated and brought
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
before the stakeholders that have been
 
05:02:20.550 --> 05:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
05:02:20.560 --> 05:02:21.270 align:start position:0%
working on this
for

05:02:21.270 --> 05:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:02:24.470 --> 05:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
say six years now quite a long time
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
so with that i would be happy to take
 
05:02:28.868 --> 05:02:28.878 align:start position:0%
any of your questions and um thank you
 
05:02:30.628 --> 05:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
for your time today
 
05:02:32.788 --> 05:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
thank you ms buchanan before we take any
 
05:02:32.798 --> 05:02:33.830 align:start position:0%
thank you ms buchanan before we take any
questions

05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:02:35.670 --> 05:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open the public hearing on
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
house bill 1248
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
and recess that public hearing until we
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
complete the current public hearing
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
now questions for ms buchanan
 
05:02:49.830 --> 05:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you miss
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
became for being here i was previously i
 
05:02:57.110 --> 05:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
asked one of the uh
 
05:02:58.868 --> 05:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
testifiers about
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
if there is a quality difference between
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
energy units
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
generated one way versus another
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
and it dawned on me from what someone's
 
05:03:08.400 --> 05:03:09.430 align:start position:0%
and it dawned on me from what someone's
mentioned

05:03:09.430 --> 05:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
05:03:09.440 --> 05:03:10.230 align:start position:0%
mentioned
that

05:03:10.230 --> 05:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:12.948 --> 05:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
when it comes to solar wrecks uh
 
05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates generated
 
05:03:16.628 --> 05:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
by solar
 
05:03:18.628 --> 05:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
the price is different in each of the
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
states in new england
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
can you tell me for example what the
 
05:03:25.350 --> 05:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
price approximately is in new hampshire
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
versus let's say in connecticut
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's an excellent question i don't
 
05:03:32.150 --> 05:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
have the exact price on top of my head i
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
know that it is lower in new hampshire
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
but i would there might be someone
 
05:03:38.230 --> 05:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
behind me who would know the exact
 
05:03:39.750 --> 05:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
05:03:41.590 --> 05:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay would
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
follow up would you be surprised to if i
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
told you that i'm pretty sure that it's
 
05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
five dollars and i'm sure
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
dollars in connecticut
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
and that sounds about right from my
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
experience okay thank you
 
05:03:57.030 --> 05:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for ms
 
05:03:57.040 --> 05:03:58.708 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for ms

05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon mr chairman and
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um again for
 
05:04:37.030 --> 05:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
the record my name is heidi kroll i work
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
at gallagher callahan gartrell and i am
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
representing granite state hydropower
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
association and with me today is
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
madeline minnow
 
05:04:48.708 --> 05:04:48.718 align:start position:0%
with essex hydro which is a gsha member
 
05:04:51.030 --> 05:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
we are very opposed to
 
05:04:52.110 --> 05:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
1629 i submitted written testimony via
 
05:04:57.910 --> 05:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
email to the committee yesterday and
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
also passing around written testimony
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:05:05.190 --> 05:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
we agree with a lot of the comments that
 
05:05:07.910 --> 05:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
have been made here today
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know first of all as you've heard
 
05:05:11.110 --> 05:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
and you're well aware there's a process
 
05:05:13.030 --> 05:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
going on at the puc
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of stakeholders have been involved
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of
 
05:05:20.708 --> 05:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
consensus and agreement around
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
the process that would take place
 
05:05:23.200 --> 05:05:23.990 align:start position:0%
the process that would take place
well

05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
while the study was going on
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
agreeing to the tariffs that are in
 
05:05:31.110 --> 05:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
place which include default service as a
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
an appropriate um
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
credit for excess generation that's put
 
05:05:37.430 --> 05:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
onto the grid by facilities that are 100
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
kw or higher
 
05:05:39.200 --> 05:05:40.310 align:start position:0%
kw or higher
um

05:05:40.310 --> 05:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:43.470 --> 05:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
i did want to point out in house bill
 
05:05:46.470 --> 05:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
1116 from 2016
 
05:05:48.868 --> 05:05:48.878 align:start position:0%
it reads in part it is in the public
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
interest to continue to provide
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable opportunities for electric
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
customers to invest in and interconnect
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
customer generator facilities and
 
05:05:59.430 --> 05:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
receive fair compensation for such
 
05:06:01.510 --> 05:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
locally produced power while ensuring
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
costs and benefits are fairly and
 
05:06:04.628 --> 05:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
transparently allocated among all
 
05:06:04.638 --> 05:06:06.470 align:start position:0%
transparently allocated among all
customers

05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
customers
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
when we read this bill as the other
 
05:06:10.708 --> 05:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
folks have testified we really do see
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
this as essentially setting the net
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
metering credit at a wholesale rate or
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
something close and we do not think that
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
that would be fair
 
05:06:22.470 --> 05:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
um fair compensation for the true value
 
05:06:25.270 --> 05:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
of net metered power that's put onto the
 
05:06:25.280 --> 05:06:26.390 align:start position:0%
of net metered power that's put onto the
grid

05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
grid
 
05:06:28.470 --> 05:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
and it's also important to recognize and
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
madeline will talk about this a little
 
05:06:32.070 --> 05:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
if you were to adopt this legislation it
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
would certainly kill
 
05:06:39.430 --> 05:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
all efforts that
 
05:06:41.830 --> 05:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
were put into motion when
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 315 was passed last year
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
allowing for
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
municipal host generators
 
05:06:50.788 --> 05:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
so again that's
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
a group net metering
 
05:06:53.440 --> 05:06:54.628 align:start position:0%
a group net metering
where

05:06:54.628 --> 05:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:06:57.190 --> 05:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
any excess generation put onto the grid
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
by a generator
 
05:07:02.310 --> 05:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
is specifically earmarked for a group of
 
05:07:02.320 --> 05:07:03.670 align:start position:0%
is specifically earmarked for a group of
customers

05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
customers
 
05:07:05.590 --> 05:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
in this case under the law a group of
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
customers who are either municipal
 
05:07:08.160 --> 05:07:09.190 align:start position:0%
customers who are either municipal
county

05:07:09.190 --> 05:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
county
 
05:07:09.200 --> 05:07:10.310 align:start position:0%
county
school

05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:07:12.628 --> 05:07:12.638 align:start position:0%
any those sorts of governmental type of
 
05:07:12.638 --> 05:07:14.788 align:start position:0%
any those sorts of governmental type of
entities

05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
entities
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
and so setting the value when the
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
generator puts the excess generation
 
05:07:21.670 --> 05:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
onto the grid which is earmarked for
 
05:07:24.390 --> 05:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
those consumers
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
giving them a value of simply wholesale
 
05:07:28.080 --> 05:07:30.070 align:start position:0%
giving them a value of simply wholesale
price

05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
price
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
really will kill group net metering in
 
05:07:34.390 --> 05:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
that situation because there is
 
05:07:39.750 --> 05:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know in a lot of cases wholesale
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
prices are barely helping to cover their
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
costs and there's really no room in
 
05:07:48.628 --> 05:07:48.638 align:start position:0%
there at all to give savings to the
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
group members
 
05:07:51.280 --> 05:07:52.070 align:start position:0%
group members
so

05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
again i'll let madeline speak more but
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
we really uh are opposed to this bill
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
because we think that it undermines the
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
fair compensation um for the the true
 
05:08:03.750 --> 05:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
value of excess generation put onto the
 
05:08:03.760 --> 05:08:06.948 align:start position:0%
value of excess generation put onto the
grid

05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:08.788 --> 05:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
i'll make a a few points so to add to
 
05:08:09.990 --> 05:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
a current existing generator would
 
05:08:15.190 --> 05:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
actually lose money by becoming a group
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
net metering host if this bill were to
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
pass compared to being a wholesale
 
05:08:21.270 --> 05:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
market participant
 
05:08:22.628 --> 05:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:08:24.070 --> 05:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
they would
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
05:08:27.510 --> 05:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
a huge financial disincentive to
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
participate in groupnet metering being a
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
groupnet metering host and returning
 
05:08:32.948 --> 05:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
some of those savings to customers that
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
would want to participate in groupnet
 
05:08:37.110 --> 05:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
metering with such a local renewable
 
05:08:37.120 --> 05:08:37.990 align:start position:0%
metering with such a local renewable
host

05:08:37.990 --> 05:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
host
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's i think important to recognize the
 
05:08:44.708 --> 05:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
fair value as has been explained by
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
several of the previous testimonies to
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
speak to some of the components that are
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
proposed to be removed here from the net
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
metering credit
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
for example capacity
 
05:08:55.990 --> 05:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
distributed generation and customer
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
generators i think absolutely deserve
 
05:09:01.910 --> 05:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
compensation for capacity the sponsor
 
05:09:03.670 --> 05:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
said that he thought they didn't because
 
05:09:06.390 --> 05:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
they are not firm power so to be clear
 
05:09:08.390 --> 05:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
in iso new england the capacity market
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
is not only open to
 
05:09:12.628 --> 05:09:12.638 align:start position:0%
what he described as firm power it's
 
05:09:14.550 --> 05:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
open to all generation all types of
 
05:09:16.868 --> 05:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
generation renewable intermittent it's
 
05:09:18.868 --> 05:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
even open to non-generation resources
 
05:09:20.230 --> 05:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
like demand response and energy
 
05:09:20.240 --> 05:09:21.430 align:start position:0%
like demand response and energy
efficiency

05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
so distributed generation either avoids
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
the capacity
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
cost so it doesn't have to be paid if
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
they're acting like a load reducer or if
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're a previous market participant and
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
had already bid into the capacity
 
05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
auction your capacity payments are
 
05:09:37.110 --> 05:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
actually transferred to your host
 
05:09:39.830 --> 05:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
utility which goes to reducing the cost
 
05:09:41.190 --> 05:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the credit or they're getting the
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
credit and then they give it to you they
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
give it back to you and you're net
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
metering credit so i think that it would
 
05:09:48.390 --> 05:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
be actually completely unfair to take
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
that away and a generator that is
 
05:09:52.628 --> 05:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
somewhat sizable
 
05:09:53.910 --> 05:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
if they were to participate in the
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
wholesale market would be getting those
 
05:09:57.350 --> 05:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
capacity payments and so that's where
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
that financial disincentive comes in
 
05:10:01.190 --> 05:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
that they actually
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
um would not
 
05:10:04.470 --> 05:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
you know as as heidi said it would kill
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
something like groupnet metering
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
which also does have some administrative
 
05:10:09.520 --> 05:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
which also does have some administrative
costs

05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
costs
 
05:10:13.110 --> 05:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
to recruit your members to manage your
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
members you also have to track all of
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
your members
 
05:10:19.830 --> 05:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
usage monthly so that you can file a
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
required annual report so there is some
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
management and all of that
 
05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
administrative work and associated cost
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
is something that the utility doesn't
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
have to do because in some other states
 
05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
group net metering or community solar is
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
managed by the utilities and that's then
 
05:10:37.110 --> 05:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
a cost of the utility incurs here in new
 
05:10:38.948 --> 05:10:38.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire the group hosts incur that
 
05:10:38.958 --> 05:10:40.070 align:start position:0%
hampshire the group hosts incur that
typically

05:10:40.070 --> 05:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
typically
 
05:10:40.080 --> 05:10:40.868 align:start position:0%
typically
so

05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:42.390 --> 05:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
um there's just to get to some of those
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
components we agree that at least the
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
default service all of it compensation
 
05:10:51.190 --> 05:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
in a rough amount of value
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
is what would be the fair compensation
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay questions for
 
05:11:00.160 --> 05:11:02.470 align:start position:0%
okay questions for
these

05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
testifiers i have one for you the
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
california public utilities commission
 
05:11:08.390 --> 05:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
just recently
 
05:11:11.110 --> 05:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
issued a recommendation that
 
05:11:13.430 --> 05:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
net metering costs be lowered from
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
retail in california to the wholesale
 
05:11:16.320 --> 05:11:17.430 align:start position:0%
retail in california to the wholesale
level

05:11:17.430 --> 05:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:11:20.470 --> 05:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
and their reasoning was that
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
charges have escalated in california to
 
05:11:25.510 --> 05:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
the point
 
05:11:25.520 --> 05:11:26.390 align:start position:0%
the point
where

05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
they were concerned
 
05:11:28.560 --> 05:11:29.510 align:start position:0%
they were concerned
that

05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
these high electricity costs would
 
05:11:33.590 --> 05:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
discourage the adoption of electric
 
05:11:36.430 --> 05:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles and the adoption of other
 
05:11:36.440 --> 05:11:38.070 align:start position:0%
vehicles and the adoption of other
electrification

05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
electrification
 
05:11:40.628 --> 05:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
such as heating systems
 
05:11:43.430 --> 05:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:45.350 --> 05:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
advance their
 
05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
net zero goals
 
05:11:49.510 --> 05:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
they were also extremely concerned about
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
05:11:54.310 --> 05:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
driving up
 
05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
electricity costs hurts low income
 
05:12:00.550 --> 05:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
people the most
 
05:12:02.230 --> 05:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
do you fear that that kind of thing
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
could happen in new hampshire if we
 
05:12:07.590 --> 05:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
don't get firm control over net metering
 
05:12:07.600 --> 05:12:09.110 align:start position:0%
don't get firm control over net metering
costs

05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
costs
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
no not at all um you're talking about a
 
05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
state that had full retail net metering
 
05:12:15.280 --> 05:12:16.230 align:start position:0%
state that had full retail net metering
credit

05:12:16.230 --> 05:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
credit
 
05:12:16.240 --> 05:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
credit
with

05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:12:17.120 --> 05:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
with
uh

05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:21.190 --> 05:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
incredibly high penetration of
 
05:12:24.150 --> 05:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
solar and other net metered resources
 
05:12:25.750 --> 05:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we're still at an
 
05:12:28.470 --> 05:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
extremely low penetration
 
05:12:28.480 --> 05:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
extremely low penetration
and

05:12:29.750 --> 05:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
since 2017
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
there are no net metered facilities or
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
customer generators that are compensated
 
05:12:37.270 --> 05:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
at full retail
 
05:12:38.948 --> 05:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
long before we get anywhere near the
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
penetration of even our neighbors like
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
vermont or massachusetts
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
the credit for customer generators is
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
already significantly below
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
full retail
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
therefore we would never get to a point
 
05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
like californ the situation california
 
05:13:01.510 --> 05:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
which granted they've had incredible
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
pushback against that decision
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
is there concern that high electricity
 
05:13:11.430 --> 05:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
prices could discourage the adoption of
 
05:13:15.430 --> 05:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:17.030 --> 05:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
projects such as
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
a move to electrical electric vehicles
 
05:13:19.520 --> 05:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
a move to electrical electric vehicles
or

05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:13:23.190 --> 05:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
electric heating
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
i mean devices is that a justified
 
05:13:27.430 --> 05:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
concern if you want to talk about high
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
electricity prices i'm a unitil customer
 
05:13:31.270 --> 05:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
here in concord and our default service
 
05:13:33.430 --> 05:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
rates just went through the roof
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
and uh that is not due to distributed
 
05:13:38.230 --> 05:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
energy resources that's due to natural
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
gas markets so
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah sure uh you know i have a heat pump
 
05:13:45.350 --> 05:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm heating with it and it's pretty
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
expensive to heat my house this winter
 
05:13:48.390 --> 05:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
because of
 
05:13:49.990 --> 05:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
the natural the international natural
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
gas markets
 
05:13:51.440 --> 05:13:52.708 align:start position:0%
gas markets
so

05:13:52.708 --> 05:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
i mean yes but does that have anything
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
to do with net metering in new hampshire
 
05:13:56.400 --> 05:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
to do with net metering in new hampshire
no

05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:13:59.830 --> 05:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you additional questions for
 
05:14:01.350 --> 05:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
i would just add to that mr chairman if
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
i could that yes go ahead uh thank you
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'll be i'll be brief but i was just
 
05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
going to say that
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know from our perspective
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
we believe that
 
05:14:12.550 --> 05:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
more renewable distributed resources
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
throughout the grid could actually add
 
05:14:17.030 --> 05:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
stability and over the long term keep
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
prices lower
 
05:14:21.350 --> 05:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
than the volatility that we're seeing in
 
05:14:23.350 --> 05:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
the markets and and competing on a
 
05:14:26.310 --> 05:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
national and international basis um
 
05:14:28.390 --> 05:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
keeping it local
 
05:14:31.350 --> 05:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
and these are very stable
 
05:14:33.590 --> 05:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
prices relatively speaking that come
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
from renewable resources compared with
 
05:14:35.760 --> 05:14:36.948 align:start position:0%
from renewable resources compared with
other

05:14:36.948 --> 05:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
generation sources that we we have right
 
05:14:39.200 --> 05:14:40.948 align:start position:0%
generation sources that we we have right
now

05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:14:43.190 --> 05:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you additional questions for
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
these ladies representative mcgee
 
05:14:47.430 --> 05:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:14:48.798 --> 05:14:49.830 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
as i listen to you speak
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
and whenever we get speakers that
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
actually have extensive experience we
 
05:14:58.150 --> 05:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of nuance in terms of
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
what's involved in uh in in pricing and
 
05:15:04.070 --> 05:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the field and what goes into
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh the markets but our committee has a
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations that revolve around
 
05:15:09.520 --> 05:15:11.110 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations that revolve around
competition

05:15:11.110 --> 05:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
competition
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
and what i'm hearing today is that we're
 
05:15:16.150 --> 05:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
we're kind of mixing apples and oranges
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is that the
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
original deregulation was to
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
help bring competition to the retail
 
05:15:25.750 --> 05:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
generation markets
 
05:15:28.868 --> 05:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about
 
05:15:31.510 --> 05:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
crossing a retail
 
05:15:31.520 --> 05:15:33.030 align:start position:0%
crossing a retail
contributor

05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
contributor
 
05:15:36.470 --> 05:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
with wholesale pricing which is another
 
05:15:37.990 --> 05:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
a different animal
 
05:15:40.470 --> 05:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
and so i i wonder if you could say a
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
little bit about that because
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
i think it depends on what problem we're
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
trying to solve and i
 
05:15:49.510 --> 05:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
i thought what we were looking at was
 
05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to make that
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
competitive market work the way we would
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
like it to work
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
and yet it seems like we're doing
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
something that's that's not centered
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
around um
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
enhancing or diversifying the retail
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
market when we're talking about applying
 
05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
wholesale rates which is really a
 
05:16:10.868 --> 05:16:10.878 align:start position:0%
different kettle of fish
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
i know it's a long question
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right i mean the
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
electric industry restructuring statute
 
05:16:19.590 --> 05:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
um talks about competition at both the
 
05:16:22.550 --> 05:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
wholesale and the retail levels and you
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
know we've as a region have done a lot
 
05:16:26.550 --> 05:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
of work and there's been a lot of
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
advancements in getting a very robust
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
wholesale competitive market but there's
 
05:16:34.470 --> 05:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
still a lot to be done at the retail
 
05:16:36.788 --> 05:16:36.798 align:start position:0%
level in making sure the consumers
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
really do have
 
05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
choices and competitive options and
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
frankly energy independence and all of
 
05:16:46.470 --> 05:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
that is where
 
05:16:46.480 --> 05:16:47.750 align:start position:0%
that is where

renewable resources
 
05:16:57.430 --> 05:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
really comes into play
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsic has a
 
05:16:59.760 --> 05:17:01.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsic has a
question

05:17:01.270 --> 05:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:17:06.150 --> 05:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um could you comment
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit about how you see
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
net meter generators
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
contributions to stabilizing energy
 
05:17:17.910 --> 05:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
prices for new hampshire residents
 
05:17:20.150 --> 05:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
in particular like was mentioned
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
the spikes in natural gas supply and
 
05:17:22.718 --> 05:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
the spikes in natural gas supply and
prices

05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
prices
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
how how does net metering contribute in
 
05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:17:28.480 --> 05:17:29.830 align:start position:0%
in that
equation

05:17:29.830 --> 05:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
equation
 
05:17:29.840 --> 05:17:31.190 align:start position:0%
equation
so

05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:17:34.310 --> 05:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
diversifying our generation resources in
 
05:17:36.628 --> 05:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
general including
 
05:17:40.470 --> 05:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
scale and fuel type or generation type
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
will great you know diversifying our
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
generation resources would help make
 
05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
this region less vulnerable to
 
05:17:52.070 --> 05:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
spikes in one specific fuel type so the
 
05:17:54.070 --> 05:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
iso new england wholesale market
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
currently is i would say over-reliant in
 
05:17:59.750 --> 05:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
natural gas generation
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of those
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
generators to somewhat protect
 
05:18:05.590 --> 05:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
themselves against some of those very
 
05:18:07.750 --> 05:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
high volatility and pricing that we've
 
05:18:10.708 --> 05:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
seen this winter are also dual fuel and
 
05:18:13.110 --> 05:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
so this winter we've seen a lot of oil
 
05:18:13.120 --> 05:18:14.390 align:start position:0%
so this winter we've seen a lot of oil
generation

05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
generation
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
in the grid kick on because when they
 
05:18:16.878 --> 05:18:17.590 align:start position:0%
in the grid kick on because when they
when

05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
heating when oil is actually cheaper
 
05:18:21.510 --> 05:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
than natural gas they'll switch
 
05:18:21.520 --> 05:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
than natural gas they'll switch
which

05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
contributes to both having a dirtier
 
05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
grid and having these high prices
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
because that's also not cheap
 
05:18:31.830 --> 05:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
everybody that heats with oil is pretty
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with that this winter as well
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
so having
 
05:18:37.750 --> 05:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know not all of the classic
 
05:18:39.190 --> 05:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
having not a lot of all of our eggs in
 
05:18:41.590 --> 05:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
one basket makes us less vulnerable to
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
the price volatility of the fuel
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
if if all of your eggs are in the
 
05:18:48.070 --> 05:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas basket and like this winter
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen very high spikes in natural
 
05:18:51.270 --> 05:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
gas prices
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
um that's resulted in much higher
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
default service bids
 
05:18:57.830 --> 05:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
especially in certain utilities as i
 
05:19:00.310 --> 05:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
said you know unitil the default service
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
rate is in the high teens
 
05:19:04.230 --> 05:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
which we haven't seen that in quite a
 
05:19:04.240 --> 05:19:05.030 align:start position:0%
which we haven't seen that in quite a
while

05:19:05.030 --> 05:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
while
 
05:19:06.990 --> 05:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
and even eversource is
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
10.63 i think
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay thank you very
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
much see no further questions i would
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
like to thank
 
05:19:17.910 --> 05:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
both of you for presenting here this
 
05:19:19.990 --> 05:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon and i would like to close the
 
05:19:24.110 --> 05:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
1629 and ask representative pimentel to
 
05:19:30.788 --> 05:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
read off the blue sheet numbers for that
 
05:19:34.390 --> 05:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
i already have a card for you on this uh
 
05:19:37.600 --> 05:19:39.350 align:start position:0%
i already have a card for you on this uh
yes

05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:19:39.360 --> 05:19:40.070 align:start position:0%
yes
so

05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for filling out a second one
 
05:19:45.430 --> 05:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay there are four names on the blue
 
05:19:48.628 --> 05:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
sheet and they were all opposed
 
05:19:50.470 --> 05:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
and on the um
 
05:19:52.628 --> 05:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
house remote testimony
 
05:19:55.190 --> 05:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
there were two in support and 113
 
05:19:55.200 --> 05:19:57.910 align:start position:0%
there were two in support and 113
opposed

05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.550 --> 05:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
so now let's open the public hearing on
 
05:20:05.430 --> 05:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1248
 
05:20:07.350 --> 05:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the replacement power for
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
net metering customer generators
 
05:20:13.510 --> 05:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i will introduce the
 
05:20:15.910 --> 05:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this legislation
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative white
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
to introduce the legislation thank you
 
05:20:22.550 --> 05:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you members of the
 
05:20:24.390 --> 05:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee i'll try to keep this brief i
 
05:20:26.230 --> 05:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
know we're running over
 
05:20:28.868 --> 05:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1248 is a bill that would
 
05:20:30.628 --> 05:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
require that certain customer generators
 
05:20:32.150 --> 05:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
provide replacement power when they
 
05:20:33.750 --> 05:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
cannot meet their grid export
 
05:20:33.760 --> 05:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
cannot meet their grid export
obligations

05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
05:20:36.868 --> 05:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
that might throw up red flags for some
 
05:20:39.030 --> 05:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
people here after discussion with
 
05:20:40.788 --> 05:20:40.798 align:start position:0%
friends of the department of energy and
 
05:20:42.788 --> 05:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
bouncing ideas off of other people i
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
should not be passed in its current form
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's likely premature at the current
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
time as well
 
05:20:54.230 --> 05:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
the bill dispen depends on a statutory
 
05:20:56.548 --> 05:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
obligation that simply does not exist
 
05:20:56.558 --> 05:20:57.670 align:start position:0%
obligation that simply does not exist
currently

05:20:57.670 --> 05:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:20:59.670 --> 05:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
i'm still exploring ways that this
 
05:21:01.830 --> 05:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
obligation could be imposed should we
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
decide that we need it and would welcome
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
that discussion among this committee in
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
both timing of and best practices for
 
05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
implementing such an obligation with
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
that said
 
05:21:12.868 --> 05:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to explain my
 
05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
reasoning for introducing this bill
 
05:21:16.868 --> 05:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
in hopes that it can stir up some ideas
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
and discussion
 
05:21:19.750 --> 05:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
the general idea behind this is to
 
05:21:20.948 --> 05:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
reduce risk
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot today about grid
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
stabilization we've talked about texas
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
both last year and this year
 
05:21:27.440 --> 05:21:28.548 align:start position:0%
both last year and this year
uh

05:21:28.548 --> 05:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:30.470 --> 05:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
rising prices inflation all these things
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
these are all concerns and having a
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
stable grid and stable power and stable
 
05:21:36.788 --> 05:21:36.798 align:start position:0%
prices is important
 
05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
as our grid continues to become more
 
05:21:40.788 --> 05:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
decentralized which i encourage and adds
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
additional renewable energy sources
 
05:21:44.868 --> 05:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
these sources will provide a larger and
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
larger percentage of our state's energy
 
05:21:46.558 --> 05:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
larger percentage of our state's energy
needs

05:21:47.590 --> 05:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
needs
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
i personally think renewable adoption is
 
05:21:51.910 --> 05:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
great i'd love to see it at 50 i think
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
currently it's at what eight percent of
 
05:21:55.510 --> 05:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
our grid production is renewable give or
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
take depending on how you calculate it
 
05:21:58.798 --> 05:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
take depending on how you calculate it
um

05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:02.310 --> 05:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
but these sources are intermittent and
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:11.270 --> 05:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
so as their market share increases so do
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
the risks associated with depending on
 
05:22:13.200 --> 05:22:14.390 align:start position:0%
the risks associated with depending on
these

05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:22:16.548 --> 05:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
the goal with this bill or a future bill
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
would be to ensure that large customer
 
05:22:19.990 --> 05:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
generators whom the grid becomes
 
05:22:21.750 --> 05:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
dependent on much like traditional
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
utilities provide some type of insurance
 
05:22:26.628 --> 05:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
while i do not intend to discourage
 
05:22:28.708 --> 05:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
renewable adoption i personally am
 
05:22:31.270 --> 05:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
planning on adopting at least two solar
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
installs on my property over the next
 
05:22:36.230 --> 05:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:37.990 --> 05:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
especially not in the short term excuse
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
me while i do not intend to discourage
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
renewable adoption especially not in the
 
05:22:42.708 --> 05:22:42.718 align:start position:0%
short term i do believe that it's our
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility to continually assess
 
05:22:45.040 --> 05:22:46.310 align:start position:0%
responsibility to continually assess
risk

05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
risk
 
05:22:48.150 --> 05:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
for our constituents to ensure a stable
 
05:22:49.590 --> 05:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
power grid
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the time i would ask that
 
05:22:53.590 --> 05:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
this bill be referred to interim study
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
05:22:59.430 --> 05:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative white for
 
05:23:01.110 --> 05:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
to make sure i understand the concept
 
05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
net metered generation is typically
 
05:23:13.280 --> 05:23:14.788 align:start position:0%
net metered generation is typically
renewable

05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
05:23:16.628 --> 05:23:16.638 align:start position:0%
comes from renewable sources either
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
solar hydro
 
05:23:19.830 --> 05:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
possibly wind
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
and that because those sources are
 
05:23:24.390 --> 05:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
intermittent you feel there needs to be
 
05:23:24.400 --> 05:23:28.070 align:start position:0%
intermittent you feel there needs to be
some

05:23:28.070 --> 05:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:28.080 --> 05:23:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
requirement

05:23:29.510 --> 05:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:23:29.520 --> 05:23:31.030 align:start position:0%
requirement
that

05:23:31.030 --> 05:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
when they can't provide their output
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
from from the generation source
 
05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
specified they have to provide it from
 
05:23:41.030 --> 05:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
some other
 
05:23:41.040 --> 05:23:42.150 align:start position:0%
some other
source

05:23:42.150 --> 05:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
source
 
05:23:44.708 --> 05:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
if it's effectively yes
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
it's simple math look at it
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
at only eight percent the grid it's not
 
05:23:50.310 --> 05:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
a big risk right these these can go on
 
05:23:52.310 --> 05:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
and off all day long it's not a big deal
 
05:23:53.830 --> 05:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
at 20
 
05:23:56.390 --> 05:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
30 50 whatever that becomes 10 years
 
05:23:58.070 --> 05:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
from now 20 years from now that's
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
something we need to be concerned about
 
05:24:01.750 --> 05:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
because that's now 50 of our grid that
 
05:24:03.190 --> 05:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
is intermittent
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
that this is just
 
05:24:06.310 --> 05:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
simply looking the basics now there are
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
things we have organizations that
 
05:24:10.070 --> 05:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
oversee this and try to stabilize this
 
05:24:11.510 --> 05:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
we have systems in place to make sure
 
05:24:13.830 --> 05:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
this is smooth but as we've seen
 
05:24:15.270 --> 05:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
from texas
 
05:24:17.270 --> 05:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's not always the case granted i
 
05:24:19.590 --> 05:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
think our i think i've lived in texas i
 
05:24:21.110 --> 05:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
grew up in texas and prior to living
 
05:24:23.350 --> 05:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
here i lived there for three years i've
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
lived in different areas of texas that
 
05:24:27.190 --> 05:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
have different
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh that are regulated in different ways
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
either through a co-op or through a
 
05:24:32.230 --> 05:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
traditional utility or where i can just
 
05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
go and pick my utility as well
 
05:24:36.868 --> 05:24:36.878 align:start position:0%
um i think our
 
05:24:36.878 --> 05:24:38.390 align:start position:0%
um i think our
regulatory

05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
05:24:39.990 --> 05:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
system here is actually better than
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
texas's in many ways um i think it
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
provides for a more stable grid um that
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
might not people might disagree with me
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
but my experience tells me so um
 
05:24:52.390 --> 05:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
so yes i think to answer your question
 
05:24:52.400 --> 05:24:53.830 align:start position:0%
so yes i think to answer your question
yes

05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
05:24:57.030 --> 05:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
05:24:57.040 --> 05:24:58.708 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
question

05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:25:01.350 --> 05:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
yes i do um
 
05:25:04.070 --> 05:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question the
 
05:25:05.910 --> 05:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
first question i have is why wouldn't
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
you want this
 
05:25:07.680 --> 05:25:08.548 align:start position:0%
you want this
bill

05:25:08.548 --> 05:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:25:09.510 --> 05:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate while you work
 
05:25:12.240 --> 05:25:13.430 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate while you work
on

05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:25:16.790 --> 05:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
the particulars that you want to work on
 
05:25:16.800 --> 05:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
the particulars that you want to work on
[Music]

05:25:19.350 --> 05:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:25:20.948 --> 05:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
that's the first question so could you
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
answer that yeah absolutely uh one
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
because i don't think my ideas are the
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
only important ones in this room i think
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot
 
05:25:28.628 --> 05:25:28.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of brains here with a lot of
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
better ideas
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
um that could potentially see angles
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
that need to be tweaked just like just
 
05:25:35.510 --> 05:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
like we're seeing with this previous
 
05:25:37.510 --> 05:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill right this where we found a
 
05:25:39.350 --> 05:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
loophole this has been around for five
 
05:25:41.270 --> 05:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
years and we haven't plugged a loophole
 
05:25:42.230 --> 05:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh what mr bilo testified to right so
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
five six years now we have a loophole
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
and a mishmash right and we had a lot of
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
brains on that there's a lot of people
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
looking at that for many years so the
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
more the more eyes the more people
 
05:25:58.150 --> 05:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
thinking the more people strategizing
 
05:26:00.070 --> 05:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
and discussing i think we can eventually
 
05:26:02.310 --> 05:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
come up with a good law that would be my
 
05:26:04.470 --> 05:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
hope that could help
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
may i follow up follow-up
 
05:26:12.868 --> 05:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
what i
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
perceive this bill to be saying is that
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
if i have
 
05:26:21.270 --> 05:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
two megawatts of generation
 
05:26:24.390 --> 05:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
and for some reason my generation fails
 
05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
that i must provide
 
05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
another source of power another source
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
of generation it doesn't say equal to
 
05:26:34.390 --> 05:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
but i would think you want it to be
 
05:26:36.788 --> 05:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
somewhat equal too
 
05:26:40.708 --> 05:26:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
is that what this bill says because
 
05:26:44.080 --> 05:26:45.110 align:start position:0%
is that what this bill says because
i

05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:26:47.510 --> 05:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know we we know i think that there's
 
05:26:48.708 --> 05:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
things that have been up and running for
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
a while and that will probably
 
05:26:54.628 --> 05:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
fail eventually
 
05:26:58.070 --> 05:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
so he were saying that one of the
 
05:27:02.548 --> 05:27:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:04.230 --> 05:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
a solar farm or whatever you're going to
 
05:27:04.240 --> 05:27:05.270 align:start position:0%
a solar farm or whatever you're going to
start

05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
start
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
if that fails or it becomes obsolete for
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
some reason
 
05:27:13.750 --> 05:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
that you as the generator must provide
 
05:27:16.390 --> 05:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
an alternative source to that
 
05:27:19.990 --> 05:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
in short yes
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
in long it's more complicated than that
 
05:27:23.840 --> 05:27:25.430 align:start position:0%
in long it's more complicated than that
um

05:27:25.430 --> 05:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
we are becoming dependent on
 
05:27:31.750 --> 05:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
non-utilities there are no obligations
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
there are no obligations for me and my
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
4.99 megawatt farm to stay plugged in
 
05:27:40.548 --> 05:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
it doesn't exist if i'm participating in
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
this particular program so that's the
 
05:27:44.788 --> 05:27:44.798 align:start position:0%
concern is as more and more as we become
 
05:27:46.350 --> 05:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
more and more dependent on these
 
05:27:46.360 --> 05:27:48.070 align:start position:0%
more and more dependent on these
non-utilities

05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
non-utilities
 
05:27:52.070 --> 05:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's a risk in our electrical grid um
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is to smooth out that
 
05:27:53.760 --> 05:27:56.628 align:start position:0%
and so the idea is to smooth out that
risk

05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:58.150 --> 05:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
right now it's not it's not an issue
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
right now right because again it's only
 
05:28:02.868 --> 05:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
seven eight percent of our grid it's not
 
05:28:05.190 --> 05:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge it affects our prices
 
05:28:06.868 --> 05:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to affect
 
05:28:09.750 --> 05:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
not having power for a week right
 
05:28:09.760 --> 05:28:11.510 align:start position:0%
not having power for a week right
usually

05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
usually
 
05:28:11.520 --> 05:28:12.310 align:start position:0%
usually
sorry

05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:28:13.830 --> 05:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you didn't mean to interrupt you i
 
05:28:16.150 --> 05:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
apologize representative thomas is
 
05:28:17.830 --> 05:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
05:28:19.110 --> 05:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you miss cheer uh thank you for
 
05:28:21.670 --> 05:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question i i think the idea of
 
05:28:23.510 --> 05:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is great i think if you
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
promise to to deliver something and
 
05:28:27.270 --> 05:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
you're getting paid for it and you don't
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
deliver on your promise you should be
 
05:28:31.990 --> 05:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
either penalized or provide a
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
reciprocal product that that you had uh
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
promised for but i
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask you um based on what
 
05:28:41.030 --> 05:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
you were saying and you're
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
recommending itl are are you implying
 
05:28:44.480 --> 05:28:45.350 align:start position:0%
recommending itl are are you implying
that

05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
rather than have this committee spend
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
some time trying to fix a
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
a bill that may not be fixable it would
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
be better to come back
 
05:28:57.510 --> 05:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
at a later time when
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
people have done maybe a collaborative
 
05:29:01.270 --> 05:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
people have done more research and
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
effort into a better worded bill
 
05:29:04.000 --> 05:29:04.868 align:start position:0%
effort into a better worded bill
yeah

05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm open to that that's that's the
 
05:29:08.548 --> 05:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
discretion of this committee um excuse
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
me uh interim study would be my
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation just so that we could
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
spend time looking into this although
 
05:29:17.350 --> 05:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 certain on
 
05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
the logistics of how interim study works
 
05:29:21.110 --> 05:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll learn that with the
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
new interim study i'm on but
 
05:29:24.080 --> 05:29:24.868 align:start position:0%
new interim study i'm on but
follow

05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:29:26.708 --> 05:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
well you
 
05:29:30.070 --> 05:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're recommending itl no i was
 
05:29:31.590 --> 05:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
recommending interim study she she
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
introduced the idea of it oh i excuse me
 
05:29:35.350 --> 05:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
i was
 
05:29:35.360 --> 05:29:36.628 align:start position:0%
i was
misinformed

05:29:36.628 --> 05:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
misinformed
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:37.600 --> 05:29:38.868 align:start position:0%
thank you
sorry

05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
sorry

representative plett is recognized for a
 
05:29:41.120 --> 05:29:44.788 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for a
question

05:29:44.788 --> 05:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:46.230 --> 05:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:29:48.150 --> 05:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
my question partially because i'm
 
05:29:50.310 --> 05:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
struggling to do with a clerk job and
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
messing it up from time to time
 
05:29:55.670 --> 05:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
i didn't i can relate i i didn't hear
 
05:29:57.670 --> 05:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
your answer why you want to pull this
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
why you don't think it's ready for prime
 
05:30:00.788 --> 05:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
time uh it's not ready for prime time
 
05:30:02.948 --> 05:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
because it depends on an obligation that
 
05:30:05.910 --> 05:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist it this is this obligates
 
05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
this says that if you're a customer
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
generator generating two megawatts
 
05:30:10.558 --> 05:30:11.430 align:start position:0%
generator generating two megawatts
uh

05:30:11.430 --> 05:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna unplug you have to
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
provide backup well there is no
 
05:30:16.470 --> 05:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
obligation for you to provide two
 
05:30:16.480 --> 05:30:17.750 align:start position:0%
obligation for you to provide two
megawatts

05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
megawatts
 
05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
you you can unplug
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
so so it simply doesn't work if we pass
 
05:30:24.868 --> 05:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
it as it is today it doesn't do anything
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
because that obligation doesn't exist
 
05:30:26.480 --> 05:30:29.830 align:start position:0%
because that obligation doesn't exist
otherwise

05:30:29.830 --> 05:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:32.070 --> 05:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you more questions uh

a question
 
05:30:36.310 --> 05:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
05:30:38.070 --> 05:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
might you be pointing at the need for us
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
to have more intermittent peak load
 
05:30:45.350 --> 05:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
generating power that can be called on
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
reliably when it's needed
 
05:30:48.718 --> 05:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
reliably when it's needed
yes

05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:56.310 --> 05:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
love those kinds of answers
 
05:30:58.150 --> 05:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
i wish that our questions could be that
 
05:30:58.160 --> 05:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
i wish that our questions could be that
succinct

05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
succinct
 
05:31:02.948 --> 05:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee you got a succinct
 
05:31:05.590 --> 05:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman
 
05:31:08.150 --> 05:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh i believe i do but it does require a
 
05:31:10.310 --> 05:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
little of a pre-precursor
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
um i i think the the concept of the bill
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
i understand where you're going with the
 
05:31:17.110 --> 05:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
grid security and all that it's a big
 
05:31:17.120 --> 05:31:18.150 align:start position:0%
grid security and all that it's a big
topic

05:31:18.150 --> 05:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
topic
 
05:31:18.160 --> 05:31:19.030 align:start position:0%
topic
um

05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:21.510 --> 05:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
but i think some of the stuff is getting
 
05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
mixed up a little bit because a lot of
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
the generators are being seen even by
 
05:31:29.430 --> 05:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
the iso new england as load reducers
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
because they're not iso new england
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
assets which means they aren't part of
 
05:31:35.830 --> 05:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
the risk that's being managed for
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
reliability of the grid by the iceland
 
05:31:40.948 --> 05:31:40.958 align:start position:0%
new england in general um so there
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
is there's more of a conversation to
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
have around how to do this right i
 
05:31:45.750 --> 05:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying about
 
05:31:45.760 --> 05:31:46.948 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying about
obligation

05:31:46.948 --> 05:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
05:31:46.958 --> 05:31:48.070 align:start position:0%
obligation
um

05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:49.590 --> 05:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
but i guess
 
05:31:51.190 --> 05:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
05:31:53.510 --> 05:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh it appears that your bill is trying
 
05:31:56.230 --> 05:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
to get at who is required to manage the
 
05:31:56.240 --> 05:31:57.830 align:start position:0%
to get at who is required to manage the
risk

05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
risk
 
05:31:57.840 --> 05:31:58.868 align:start position:0%
risk
and

05:31:58.868 --> 05:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
and what you're saying is the individual
 
05:32:04.070 --> 05:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
who is looking to produce solar and
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
maybe use it locally or sell it locally
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
if they're a generator
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
should share in the risk of reliability
 
05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
that the grid operators have and i think
 
05:32:13.520 --> 05:32:14.548 align:start position:0%
that the grid operators have and i think
that's

05:32:14.548 --> 05:32:14.558 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know there's a bigger conversation
 
05:32:17.830 --> 05:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
there i think that's open to debate and
 
05:32:19.830 --> 05:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
i think it likely only applies to
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
certain customer generators of a certain
 
05:32:23.590 --> 05:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
size and again that's open to debate and
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of this committee to
 
05:32:27.750 --> 05:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
determine um may i fall
 
05:32:29.430 --> 05:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah i think i think that
 
05:32:31.030 --> 05:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's what the icelandic one does
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
though if if there's an asset that's
 
05:32:35.670 --> 05:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
being leveraged uh in their giant board
 
05:32:36.948 --> 05:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
that we went and visited a couple of
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
years ago you'd have to go see it at iso
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
new england uh
 
05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:32:44.708 --> 05:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
there are categories of generators that
 
05:32:44.718 --> 05:32:45.510 align:start position:0%
there are categories of generators that
are

05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
are legitimate assets uh that they
 
05:32:48.878 --> 05:32:49.830 align:start position:0%
are legitimate assets uh that they
manage

05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
manage
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
they are in a different category than
 
05:32:53.190 --> 05:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
the people that you're trying to pull
 
05:32:54.788 --> 05:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
into that category
 
05:32:56.628 --> 05:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
so i think we we probably would have to
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
have more conversation around
 
05:33:02.628 --> 05:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
really what the objective is because
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
if these folks are not being looked at
 
05:33:05.830 --> 05:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
as load reducers and they're being
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
looked at as people that have to
 
05:33:08.628 --> 05:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
constantly produce or they're going to
 
05:33:11.350 --> 05:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
be penalized then you are going to kill
 
05:33:13.270 --> 05:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
the adoption and i think you said that
 
05:33:15.110 --> 05:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
that was not your aim right yeah my aim
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
is not to kill the adoption but there is
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
going to become there will be a point in
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
time where we don't look at them as load
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
reducers we look at them as
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
effectively you power you to you energy
 
05:33:29.430 --> 05:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
utilities because we are so dependent on
 
05:33:31.990 --> 05:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
them which is fine i i i'm okay with
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
that growing and and that adoption
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
taking place but that that is something
 
05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to be looking out for over
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
the next
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
several years decade who knows right we
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't know obviously our adoption's
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
slower here in this state um that i
 
05:33:49.430 --> 05:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
expect that to change simply based on
 
05:33:51.270 --> 05:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
market forces we have
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
compounding inflation
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
logistical supply chain
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
issues fuel
 
05:33:59.910 --> 05:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know fuel doesn't last forever um
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of different things
 
05:34:03.670 --> 05:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
right so i fully expect just based on
 
05:34:05.910 --> 05:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
market forces we will continue to adopt
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
more solar wind and renewable energies
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
um so this is
 
05:34:12.150 --> 05:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
this will become an issue if it's not
 
05:34:14.310 --> 05:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
this year or next year maybe it's next
 
05:34:16.390 --> 05:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
decade i don't know
 
05:34:17.590 --> 05:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
we'll follow up yeah the last thing i'll
 
05:34:21.910 --> 05:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
say is just we're not texas right we're
 
05:34:25.030 --> 05:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
not deregulated so we actually have
 
05:34:27.190 --> 05:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
regulators whose responsibility it is to
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
manage the reliability of the grid so i
 
05:34:30.948 --> 05:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
think that's you know
 
05:34:32.948 --> 05:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
we need to understand the full picture
 
05:34:34.310 --> 05:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
before we start inserting ourselves
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
saying we have to solve this problem
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm not sure we can solve it
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
from here okay remember we're not here
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
to discuss or debate we're here to ask
 
05:34:41.760 --> 05:34:42.948 align:start position:0%
to discuss or debate we're here to ask
questions

05:34:42.948 --> 05:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative samsic
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr white
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
for being here and i too agree with the
 
05:34:51.190 --> 05:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
premise of your bill i think it's it's
 
05:34:53.190 --> 05:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
only sensible to say if you promise
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
something you have to deliver it
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
god knows the state has made many
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
promises that it's never kept
 
05:35:00.548 --> 05:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
and however
 
05:35:00.558 --> 05:35:02.470 align:start position:0%
and however
um

05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
one thing i'm a little perplexed about a
 
05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
a unit a generator of one megawatt peak
 
05:35:10.470 --> 05:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think is maybe a couple thousand
 
05:35:12.868 --> 05:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
panels it's a big place
 
05:35:15.270 --> 05:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh if i were an investor
 
05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
or a municipality and i built something
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:35:22.070 --> 05:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh i would definitely want to make sure
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
that i get my money's worth
 
05:35:26.150 --> 05:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:35:29.110 --> 05:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
i'm buying it or i have a market for it
 
05:35:30.948 --> 05:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
and so someone who's buying it for me
 
05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
has an agreement with me a contract
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
contractual agreement
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no way i can default on that
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
without some kind of penalty so i think
 
05:35:42.548 --> 05:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
that's the way it is right now that
 
05:35:44.628 --> 05:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
nobody would be foolish enough to create
 
05:35:46.548 --> 05:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
something like this and then when they
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
can't deliver they say sorry i don't
 
05:35:50.230 --> 05:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
have enough power for you today you have
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
a contractual legal obligation right now
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise nobody would invest or build
 
05:35:57.510 --> 05:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
something like that is is that is that
 
05:35:57.520 --> 05:35:58.470 align:start position:0%
something like that is is that is that
correct

05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:36:01.110 --> 05:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
that this is what's happening now
 
05:36:02.788 --> 05:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
as far as i know that's the normal
 
05:36:02.798 --> 05:36:05.270 align:start position:0%
as far as i know that's the normal
pattern

05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:07.030 --> 05:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 certain but that sounds
 
05:36:09.910 --> 05:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay i believe that's how it
 
05:36:09.920 --> 05:36:11.030 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay i believe that's how it
operates

05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
operates
 
05:36:11.040 --> 05:36:12.948 align:start position:0%
operates
uh

05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:36:14.470 --> 05:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
i believe someone testified earlier that
 
05:36:15.910 --> 05:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
these large installs have a direct
 
05:36:22.708 --> 05:36:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:25.590 --> 05:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions seeing none i
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
will call on
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
our last testifier on this bill that
 
05:36:33.030 --> 05:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
would be joseph kwasnik
 
05:36:35.430 --> 05:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
of concord representing himself mr
 
05:36:41.110 --> 05:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:41.120 --> 05:36:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:36:41.990 --> 05:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
mr kwasnik
 
05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
has deferred
 
05:36:47.830 --> 05:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
his testimony so
 
05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:54.310 --> 05:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
i've just been handed another pink card
 
05:36:56.390 --> 05:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
kelly buchanan of clean energy new
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:04.548 --> 05:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
thank you i would remind everyone if you
 
05:37:06.150 --> 05:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
want to testify you have to submit a
 
05:37:08.070 --> 05:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
pink card otherwise
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're out we're out of here
 
05:37:12.390 --> 05:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
i apologize for tempting you with the
 
05:37:14.948 --> 05:37:14.958 align:start position:0%
option of release um but i appreciate
 
05:37:16.868 --> 05:37:16.878 align:start position:0%
your patience and the opportunity to
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
give some brief remarks today
 
05:37:21.750 --> 05:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm glad to hear that the sponsor of
 
05:37:23.670 --> 05:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1248 had some productive
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
discussions with the department of
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
energy and relevant stakeholders to
 
05:37:28.948 --> 05:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
really understand the mechanics and the
 
05:37:31.990 --> 05:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
difficulties with the bill is submitted
 
05:37:33.670 --> 05:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to deviate from my written
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
testimony which i have for you today a
 
05:37:38.230 --> 05:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
bit and say that perhaps there are other
 
05:37:39.750 --> 05:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
ways in which
 
05:37:41.430 --> 05:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
we can
 
05:37:43.590 --> 05:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
address the intermittency of distributed
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
energy resources
 
05:37:46.470 --> 05:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
05:37:48.150 --> 05:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's important to consider the
 
05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
importance of grid modernization and a
 
05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
smart grid that becomes more flexible
 
05:37:54.070 --> 05:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
adaptable and reactive to that
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
intermittency issue and so
 
05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps in light of that there might be
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
an opportunity in the future for the
 
05:38:02.070 --> 05:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
committee to examine that in more detail
 
05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
with that i
 
05:38:05.750 --> 05:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
i believe in terms of clean energy new
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire's position position
 
05:38:09.030 --> 05:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
05:38:10.628 --> 05:38:10.638 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that the vote goes to
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
interim city or um happy to consider
 
05:38:17.350 --> 05:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
an itl motion as as acceptable um and of
 
05:38:18.788 --> 05:38:18.798 align:start position:0%
course that's at the jurisdiction of the
 
05:38:20.868 --> 05:38:20.878 align:start position:0%
committee but with that i'd be glad to
 
05:38:23.110 --> 05:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
take any questions and keep it brief
 
05:38:23.120 --> 05:38:24.948 align:start position:0%
take any questions and keep it brief
today

05:38:24.948 --> 05:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any questions for
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:35.030 --> 05:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'll call on the next
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
folks who want to testify and that would
 
05:38:36.798 --> 05:38:38.070 align:start position:0%
folks who want to testify and that would
be

05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:38:38.080 --> 05:38:39.910 align:start position:0%
be
the

05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
the ladies from
 
05:38:43.110 --> 05:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
the granite state hydro power
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
association the tag team of
 
05:38:49.270 --> 05:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
miss kroll and ms minnow
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and good afternoon
 
05:38:52.628 --> 05:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
again for the record my name is heidi
 
05:38:54.310 --> 05:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
kroll i work at gallagher callahan and
 
05:38:55.830 --> 05:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
gartrell and i represent the granite
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
state hydropower association and with me
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
today is madeline minnow with essex
 
05:39:02.628 --> 05:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
hydro which is a member of the granite
 
05:39:04.470 --> 05:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
state hydropower association
 
05:39:06.310 --> 05:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
um i think a lot of the concerns that we
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
had with this bill have already been
 
05:39:09.190 --> 05:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
addressed and we're
 
05:39:12.310 --> 05:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear that this sponsor has um
 
05:39:13.830 --> 05:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
spoken with folks at the department of
 
05:39:15.990 --> 05:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
energy and and otherwise to kind of
 
05:39:17.830 --> 05:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
understand one of the points we were
 
05:39:19.590 --> 05:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
going to make which is that
 
05:39:21.190 --> 05:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
this concept of kind of export
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
obligation doesn't really exist
 
05:39:25.270 --> 05:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
currently in the net metering and group
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
05:39:29.590 --> 05:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
world and the only thing i think we at
 
05:39:30.868 --> 05:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
least i was going to add to the
 
05:39:32.548 --> 05:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
conversation and it kind of came up a
 
05:39:34.470 --> 05:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
little bit is that
 
05:39:37.110 --> 05:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
in the context of group net metering
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
there is a contractual arrangement
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
between the generator
 
05:39:41.840 --> 05:39:42.548 align:start position:0%
between the generator
and

05:39:42.548 --> 05:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:45.190 --> 05:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
under our current law the municipal host
 
05:39:48.548 --> 05:39:48.558 align:start position:0%
and the members in the group and so
 
05:39:50.708 --> 05:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
in the context of negotiating that
 
05:39:50.718 --> 05:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
in the context of negotiating that
contract

05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
which includes all kinds of terms and
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
conditions you know
 
05:39:58.548 --> 05:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
the consumers could
 
05:40:00.868 --> 05:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
require the generator to meet certain
 
05:40:03.510 --> 05:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
minimum performance standards
 
05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
they could
 
05:40:07.190 --> 05:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
require that there be a guarantee to a
 
05:40:10.390 --> 05:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of financial savings
 
05:40:12.788 --> 05:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
to the group members under the contract
 
05:40:16.470 --> 05:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
and so there is there is that at least
 
05:40:19.190 --> 05:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
um i think under the the current
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
scheme um
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
of how group net metering is working so
 
05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to mention that
 
05:40:26.708 --> 05:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
i'll just add that we you know we
 
05:40:28.548 --> 05:40:28.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsor's concern about
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
grid reliability but that is you know
 
05:40:32.628 --> 05:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
squarely in the purview of iso new
 
05:40:35.910 --> 05:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
england to manage uh really and i want
 
05:40:37.510 --> 05:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
to be careful not to
 
05:40:39.190 --> 05:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
lump all of the customer generators in
 
05:40:41.110 --> 05:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
the solar bucket right there are we
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
represent small hydro and though if
 
05:40:45.670 --> 05:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're run of river we can be considered
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
intermittent it's in a very different
 
05:40:47.600 --> 05:40:48.628 align:start position:0%
intermittent it's in a very different
way

05:40:48.628 --> 05:40:48.638 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
then solar or wind is intermittent and
 
05:40:52.708 --> 05:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
so if you have a variety of renewable
 
05:40:54.548 --> 05:40:54.558 align:start position:0%
resources they can actually complement
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
each other very well and their
 
05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
generation profiles are very different
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
we are intermittent on a seasonal basis
 
05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a daily basis right now
 
05:41:05.590 --> 05:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're generating 24 7 very very steadily
 
05:41:07.510 --> 05:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:41:09.670 --> 05:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
and then we also wanted to reiterate
 
05:41:09.680 --> 05:41:10.470 align:start position:0%
and then we also wanted to reiterate
that

05:41:10.470 --> 05:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
any generator under five megawatts in
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
new england
 
05:41:15.750 --> 05:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
has no
 
05:41:19.110 --> 05:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
generation obligation so we own uh hydro
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
projects one that is over five megawatts
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
and all the rest are under and those are
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
treated extremely differently by iso new
 
05:41:28.548 --> 05:41:28.558 align:start position:0%
england the one that is over five
 
05:41:30.470 --> 05:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
megawatts is
 
05:41:31.990 --> 05:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
visible to ice in new england at all
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
times we have to be able 24 7 to take a
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
curtailment signal or to take a must
 
05:41:38.470 --> 05:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
generate signal
 
05:41:39.910 --> 05:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
all of the ones under five megabytes
 
05:41:41.590 --> 05:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
which is regardless of what generation
 
05:41:43.990 --> 05:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
type it is this would apply if you had a
 
05:41:46.470 --> 05:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
four megawatt natural gas plant which
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't exist but it would it
 
05:41:50.070 --> 05:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
would be treated the same way it's based
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
on how much you can generate not what
 
05:41:54.070 --> 05:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
you generate with
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
so those are treated very differently so
 
05:41:58.868 --> 05:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
any generator under five megawatts you
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
know truly has no
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh generation obligation regardless of
 
05:42:08.310 --> 05:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
what market it's participating in so i
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
did want to make that clear as well
 
05:42:12.788 --> 05:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for either of you
 
05:42:16.788 --> 05:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
to procure
 
05:42:19.110 --> 05:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
and provide to this committee
 
05:42:23.590 --> 05:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
a copy of a group net metering contract
 
05:42:26.470 --> 05:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
that we could look at to understand how
 
05:42:28.628 --> 05:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
group net metering
 
05:42:30.628 --> 05:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
contracts are structured and how it all
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
works i think they're all different and
 
05:42:35.670 --> 05:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
if it is between two private businesses
 
05:42:38.548 --> 05:42:38.558 align:start position:0%
that is uh you know they they typically
 
05:42:40.788 --> 05:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
include a confidentiality clause
 
05:42:44.470 --> 05:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
um i will say that there are um anything
 
05:42:46.628 --> 05:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
that's with a municipality so if you
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
know for example your municipality has
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
entered into a group meeting agreement
 
05:42:52.708 --> 05:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
that likely had to be published in
 
05:42:52.718 --> 05:42:53.670 align:start position:0%
that likely had to be published in
um

05:42:53.670 --> 05:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:56.470 --> 05:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
the city council or the the select board
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
agenda so certainly i'm sure that there
 
05:42:59.670 --> 05:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
are some out there because there are
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities participating grouping
 
05:43:02.548 --> 05:43:02.558 align:start position:0%
and metering but
 
05:43:05.030 --> 05:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have one to provide you and as
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
heidi said
 
05:43:09.750 --> 05:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
they are likely entirely different every
 
05:43:11.590 --> 05:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
every agreement you know every member
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
that i've potential member that i've
 
05:43:14.470 --> 05:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
talked to
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
wants different terms and conditions
 
05:43:16.160 --> 05:43:17.190 align:start position:0%
wants different terms and conditions
either

05:43:17.190 --> 05:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
either
 
05:43:19.590 --> 05:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
as far as exactly like performance
 
05:43:22.310 --> 05:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
guarantee or duration of the contract or
 
05:43:23.910 --> 05:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
different conditions under which they
 
05:43:25.830 --> 05:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
could leave or join or
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
things like that so i think they're all
 
05:43:29.350 --> 05:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
quite different
 
05:43:32.150 --> 05:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i was looking for a sample not a uh
 
05:43:34.230 --> 05:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
just a representative sample contract
 
05:43:34.240 --> 05:43:35.670 align:start position:0%
just a representative sample contract
not

05:43:35.670 --> 05:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:43:38.230 --> 05:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
a contract that that would cover all
 
05:43:40.390 --> 05:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
possibilities yeah but thank you for
 
05:43:42.390 --> 05:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
that uh representative pled had a
 
05:43:42.400 --> 05:43:44.948 align:start position:0%
that uh representative pled had a
question

05:43:44.948 --> 05:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:43:47.430 --> 05:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
let's see if i can remember
 
05:43:48.628 --> 05:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:43:51.270 --> 05:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
your statement of iso new england uh
 
05:43:52.948 --> 05:43:52.958 align:start position:0%
over five megawatts and under five
 
05:43:54.708 --> 05:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
megawatts they don't look accurate of
 
05:43:54.718 --> 05:43:55.990 align:start position:0%
megawatts they don't look accurate of
course

05:43:55.990 --> 05:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
course
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
as time goes on and the under five
 
05:44:00.868 --> 05:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
megawatts get bigger and bigger as a
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
slice of the pie could that change and i
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
realize there's
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
federal versus state jurisdictions but
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
if we want to keep a system together
 
05:44:11.350 --> 05:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
maybe have some cooperation between the
 
05:44:12.868 --> 05:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
ice and new england and the states to
 
05:44:14.470 --> 05:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
procure information
 
05:44:16.708 --> 05:44:16.718 align:start position:0%
to essentially dispatch were they not
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
now dispatching uh yeah absolutely of
 
05:44:21.590 --> 05:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
course rules are not written in stone
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
and they could iso new england could
 
05:44:24.868 --> 05:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
change their requirements
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
utilities can change their
 
05:44:28.948 --> 05:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
interconnection requirements um fairly
 
05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
willingly actually we're undergoing some
 
05:44:33.030 --> 05:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
of that in maine where maine has seen a
 
05:44:33.040 --> 05:44:33.910 align:start position:0%
of that in maine where maine has seen a
big

05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
big
 
05:44:37.030 --> 05:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
boom in distributed generation and as a
 
05:44:39.030 --> 05:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
result even though we've been existing
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
generators for a long time central maine
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
power is revising their interconnection
 
05:44:45.670 --> 05:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
agreements which affects some of the
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
existing resources which
 
05:44:50.230 --> 05:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
their goal is to have more visibility
 
05:44:52.390 --> 05:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
into some of the smaller resources so
 
05:44:54.470 --> 05:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes of course
 
05:44:57.510 --> 05:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's why i said the reliability is iso
 
05:44:58.708 --> 05:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
new england's
 
05:45:01.830 --> 05:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility and so i have
 
05:45:03.270 --> 05:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
faith that they will do what is
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
necessary to ensure that we continue to
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
have a reliable grid and if that means
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we start to have more and more
 
05:45:11.750 --> 05:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
smaller resources they may want more
 
05:45:13.030 --> 05:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
visibility into some of those smaller
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
resources and they have the ability to
 
05:45:16.948 --> 05:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
require that
 
05:45:18.548 --> 05:45:18.558 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
05:45:18.558 --> 05:45:21.510 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
question

05:45:21.510 --> 05:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:24.150 --> 05:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
my question would be that there's no con
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
if if i understand you're right there's
 
05:45:28.310 --> 05:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
no contractual obligation for the
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
smaller producers
 
05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
and as i sit here
 
05:45:33.520 --> 05:45:35.590 align:start position:0%
and as i sit here
i

05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:45:35.600 --> 05:45:37.350 align:start position:0%
i
wonder

05:45:37.350 --> 05:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
05:45:37.360 --> 05:45:38.470 align:start position:0%
wonder
if

05:45:38.470 --> 05:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:45:40.230 --> 05:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
we are ignoring
 
05:45:40.240 --> 05:45:41.190 align:start position:0%
we are ignoring
one

05:45:41.190 --> 05:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:45:42.868 --> 05:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
branch of the government
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
call the courts
 
05:45:48.708 --> 05:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
and whether we can or you can
 
05:45:51.350 --> 05:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
do you believe that you could in your
 
05:45:54.948 --> 05:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
contract compel a private business
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
to do something that they are not
 
05:46:00.150 --> 05:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:00.160 --> 05:46:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:46:01.030 --> 05:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not an attorney i i'm not going to
 
05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
even i ask the questions so i'm not sure
 
05:46:06.788 --> 05:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
but obviously if they're not capable of
 
05:46:08.788 --> 05:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
doing it they're not capable of doing it
 
05:46:10.788 --> 05:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
there could be in a contract a clause
 
05:46:12.628 --> 05:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
where there's a financial penalty for
 
05:46:12.638 --> 05:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
where there's a financial penalty for
non-performance

05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
non-performance
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
that's typically how that shows up right
 
05:46:18.628 --> 05:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
if you can't generate
 
05:46:22.070 --> 05:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
if you're uh you know it's happened that
 
05:46:24.150 --> 05:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
major generators
 
05:46:26.470 --> 05:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
connection to the grid goes down right
 
05:46:28.548 --> 05:46:28.558 align:start position:0%
in a big storm they can't generate even
 
05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
though they should be generating and
 
05:46:32.788 --> 05:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
that causes some very big problems
 
05:46:33.910 --> 05:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
they can't generate if they're not
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
connected to the grid or they at least
 
05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
can't put the power out there
 
05:46:38.390 --> 05:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
they can't do what they can't do but
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
there can be financial penalties for
 
05:46:42.788 --> 05:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
failing to meet an obligation
 
05:46:44.548 --> 05:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
typically that's how that and can i
 
05:46:47.110 --> 05:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
follow follow-up can that and that could
 
05:46:47.120 --> 05:46:49.430 align:start position:0%
follow follow-up can that and that could
be

05:46:49.430 --> 05:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:52.310 --> 05:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
a contractual one of one of your
 
05:46:55.430 --> 05:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
stipulations in your contract that if
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
you cannot perform or you choose not to
 
05:46:57.840 --> 05:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
you cannot perform or you choose not to
perform

05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
perform
 
05:47:00.000 --> 05:47:01.510 align:start position:0%
perform
that

05:47:01.510 --> 05:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:02.868 --> 05:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
for the duration of whatever your
 
05:47:04.708 --> 05:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
contract is there could be financial
 
05:47:07.350 --> 05:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
consequences yes such as
 
05:47:09.190 --> 05:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
heidi was mentioning in for group hosts
 
05:47:10.868 --> 05:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
and group members they negotiate the
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
terms of their agreement and so you
 
05:47:16.310 --> 05:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
could say that i'm your group member
 
05:47:17.990 --> 05:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
even if you're not generating and not
 
05:47:19.750 --> 05:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
getting paid
 
05:47:22.230 --> 05:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
i expect a certain amount of
 
05:47:24.390 --> 05:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
credit being shared with me
 
05:47:27.830 --> 05:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
so the the host may not be making any
 
05:47:27.840 --> 05:47:29.430 align:start position:0%
so the the host may not be making any
revenue

05:47:29.430 --> 05:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
but they've guaranteed that they're
 
05:47:31.830 --> 05:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to make a minimum amount of
 
05:47:34.070 --> 05:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
payment to their members so if their
 
05:47:35.350 --> 05:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
equipment breaks down and they can't
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
generate for a whole year but in under
 
05:47:38.708 --> 05:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
their contract terms they've said we
 
05:47:41.750 --> 05:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
will share a certain minimum amount of
 
05:47:43.670 --> 05:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
value with you they're still going to
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
make those payments otherwise they'll be
 
05:47:48.230 --> 05:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
in breach of their contract thank you
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay before i call on the next
 
05:47:51.750 --> 05:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
questioner i just want to point out we
 
05:47:53.830 --> 05:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
have one more person who has signed up
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill and i'm going to
 
05:47:59.110 --> 05:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
close this public hearing at
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
2 55
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
so that we can take a five-minute break
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
before the next public hearing starts
 
05:48:06.628 --> 05:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
so i just want to alert everybody to
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
that reality
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative samsic has a question
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:48:15.030 --> 05:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question this question goes to
 
05:48:19.910 --> 05:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
miss minnow uh because of the idea that
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
the contractual issues
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh i think you your your hydro uh
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
businesses probably have this all the
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
time but i'm assuming that you have
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
similar contractual legal obligations to
 
05:48:34.548 --> 05:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
some of your customers to say we will
 
05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
provide you with so much power
 
05:48:39.190 --> 05:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
in your particular case or in that
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
business case uh what are the clauses
 
05:48:45.590 --> 05:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
that that would
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
preclude let's say if all of a sudden
 
05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
something happened and you couldn't
 
05:48:48.958 --> 05:48:50.310 align:start position:0%
something happened and you couldn't
deliver

05:48:50.310 --> 05:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
05:48:52.470 --> 05:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
what is the what is the normal remedy
 
05:48:53.910 --> 05:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:48:55.910 --> 05:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
um you know i can't speak to the details
 
05:48:58.788 --> 05:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
of all of our contracts we do um
 
05:49:01.430 --> 05:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
market our energy in different ways you
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
know they're not some of them are group
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
net metering hosts but some of them um
 
05:49:07.270 --> 05:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
have direct contracts with different
 
05:49:07.280 --> 05:49:09.590 align:start position:0%
have direct contracts with different
purchasers

05:49:09.590 --> 05:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
purchasers
 
05:49:11.670 --> 05:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'll say that some
 
05:49:14.868 --> 05:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
some purchasers go out specifically
 
05:49:14.878 --> 05:49:16.628 align:start position:0%
some purchasers go out specifically
for

05:49:16.628 --> 05:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:49:19.830 --> 05:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
guaranteed firm service in specific
 
05:49:19.840 --> 05:49:21.030 align:start position:0%
guaranteed firm service in specific
tranches

05:49:21.030 --> 05:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
tranches
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
so there will be a peak a guaranteed
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
peak delivery a guaranteed delivery and
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
we generally do shy away from that a
 
05:49:31.830 --> 05:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
little bit because the penalties can be
 
05:49:34.708 --> 05:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
extremely severe for non-performance
 
05:49:34.718 --> 05:49:35.830 align:start position:0%
extremely severe for non-performance
so

05:49:35.830 --> 05:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:49:37.430 --> 05:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
yeah usually you're either going to have
 
05:49:39.430 --> 05:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
to pay them
 
05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to buy replacement power or
 
05:49:43.830 --> 05:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
buy the replacement power yourself to
 
05:49:46.390 --> 05:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
transfer to them
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
thank you much as we all enjoy a good
 
05:49:50.788 --> 05:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
brainstorming session i think we're
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to cut this one short and
 
05:49:55.510 --> 05:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you both for testifying and call
 
05:49:57.590 --> 05:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
on griffin roberge from the department
 
05:49:59.590 --> 05:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
of energy for
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:08.628 --> 05:50:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vos members of the
 
05:50:11.110 --> 05:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
committee griffin roberge new hampshire
 
05:50:12.628 --> 05:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to keep it as brief as
 
05:50:14.400 --> 05:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
i'm going to keep it as brief as
possible

05:50:15.590 --> 05:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
possible
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
and no surprise doe is neutral
 
05:50:21.110 --> 05:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
i did just want to say that i did reach
 
05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
out to representative white
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
i think it was last week maybe two weeks
 
05:50:24.958 --> 05:50:25.750 align:start position:0%
i think it was last week maybe two weeks
ago

05:50:25.750 --> 05:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
just to briefly discuss the bill he and
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
i had a good conversation on it and
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
everything like that and certainly
 
05:50:31.830 --> 05:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
05:50:33.430 --> 05:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
be part of any type of process to
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
further talk about this language but
 
05:50:37.910 --> 05:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
more or less what i wanted to say today
 
05:50:40.150 --> 05:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
has largely been expressed by people who
 
05:50:42.310 --> 05:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
testified earlier you know in short new
 
05:50:44.868 --> 05:50:44.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire doesn't have any type of
 
05:50:46.708 --> 05:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement for custer
 
05:50:48.310 --> 05:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
customer generators to fulfill any
 
05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
export obligations so
 
05:50:52.390 --> 05:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
the bill is requiring replacement power
 
05:50:53.910 --> 05:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
for an export obligation that doesn't
 
05:50:53.920 --> 05:50:55.430 align:start position:0%
for an export obligation that doesn't
exist

05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
exist
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
again certainly willing to uh work with
 
05:50:59.110 --> 05:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative white and other
 
05:51:01.910 --> 05:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on on this issue but
 
05:51:03.430 --> 05:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
like i said most of my comments would
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
have been addressed already
 
05:51:09.990 --> 05:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
great any questions for mr roberge
 
05:51:11.350 --> 05:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:51:13.350 --> 05:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call the
 
05:51:16.948 --> 05:51:16.958 align:start position:0%
public hearing on house bill 1248
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
closed and asked representative pimentel
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:30.868 --> 05:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there are three names on the
 
05:51:33.510 --> 05:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
blue sheet all opposed
 
05:51:36.868 --> 05:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
and on the remote testifying
 
05:51:40.868 --> 05:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh one support and 115 oppose
 
05:51:42.390 --> 05:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:51:43.830 --> 05:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
so we will be
 
05:51:45.110 --> 05:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
taking a
 
05:51:47.590 --> 05:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
a break until three o'clock at which
 
05:51:51.030 --> 05:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
time we will come back to hear our final
 
05:51:53.110 --> 05:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
bill our final house bill
 
05:51:56.548 --> 05:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
for this session year that's hb 1491 fn
 
05:51:58.548 --> 05:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
local relative to natural gas
 
05:52:01.510 --> 05:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
transmission pipeline safety we'll see
 
06:02:49.270 --> 06:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:49.280 --> 06:02:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:02:50.310 --> 06:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:02:54.390 --> 06:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
time for our final public hearing
 
06:02:57.670 --> 06:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
on a house bill for the 2022 session
 
06:02:57.680 --> 06:02:59.110 align:start position:0%
on a house bill for the 2022 session
year

06:02:59.110 --> 06:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:03:02.590 --> 06:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:02.600 --> 06:03:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
1491

06:03:04.310 --> 06:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
1491
 
06:03:06.470 --> 06:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
dash fn-local
 
06:03:08.390 --> 06:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
don't ask me why it's not a
 
06:03:10.708 --> 06:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
early bill but it's not i have no idea
 
06:03:10.718 --> 06:03:12.230 align:start position:0%
early bill but it's not i have no idea
why

06:03:12.230 --> 06:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:03:13.830 --> 06:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's relative to natural gas
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
transmission pipeline safety
 
06:03:19.030 --> 06:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to call first on the prime
 
06:03:21.670 --> 06:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill representative joe
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
alexander to introduce this legislation
 
06:03:27.190 --> 06:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
take it away joe
 
06:03:29.350 --> 06:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um chairman vos and members
 
06:03:31.430 --> 06:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
of uh science technology and energy i
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
know you saved the best bill for last so
 
06:03:35.430 --> 06:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that
 
06:03:37.590 --> 06:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
hp 1491 is
 
06:03:39.190 --> 06:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is joe alexander
 
06:03:40.708 --> 06:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
i represent the town of goffstown which
 
06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
is hillsboro district six
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
hp 1491 is advanced notification
 
06:03:48.548 --> 06:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
legislation so it seeks to create
 
06:03:50.230 --> 06:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
pipeline safety dialogue between
 
06:03:52.150 --> 06:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
property developers and owners and
 
06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
natural gas transmission pipeline
 
06:03:54.480 --> 06:03:55.750 align:start position:0%
natural gas transmission pipeline
operators

06:03:55.750 --> 06:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
operators
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
when new land use or property
 
06:03:58.390 --> 06:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
development is planned near a
 
06:04:00.390 --> 06:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
transmission pipeline
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
so why it's needed um in tennessee
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
developers built homes right up right up
 
06:04:07.030 --> 06:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
to a right-of-way which resulted in land
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
owners assuming the right-of-way was
 
06:04:10.390 --> 06:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
their backyard
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
so they were building structures in
 
06:04:13.750 --> 06:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
unsafe manners
 
06:04:15.670 --> 06:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
in pennsylvania developer designed homes
 
06:04:18.230 --> 06:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
as close to 16 feet from a pipeline
 
06:04:20.548 --> 06:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
which would then not allow them to make
 
06:04:22.390 --> 06:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
any more modifications to the existing
 
06:04:22.400 --> 06:04:23.990 align:start position:0%
any more modifications to the existing
development

06:04:23.990 --> 06:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
development
 
06:04:24.000 --> 06:04:25.030 align:start position:0%
development
so

06:04:25.030 --> 06:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
with the early notification provided in
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
this bill we can prevent the necessary
 
06:04:29.040 --> 06:04:30.470 align:start position:0%
this bill we can prevent the necessary
modifications

06:04:30.470 --> 06:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
modifications
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
that would take significant time and
 
06:04:32.718 --> 06:04:33.670 align:start position:0%
that would take significant time and
costs

06:04:33.670 --> 06:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
costs
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
to developers later in the application
 
06:04:37.910 --> 06:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
or the building process so
 
06:04:39.430 --> 06:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
06:04:41.110 --> 06:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
basically make sure that the the
 
06:04:43.750 --> 06:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
notification is in advanced developers
 
06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
know where the pipeline is
 
06:04:47.430 --> 06:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
through mapping data and then they can
 
06:04:49.190 --> 06:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
kind of modify their development based
 
06:04:51.190 --> 06:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
on that information provided
 
06:04:52.868 --> 06:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
so that would be within that would
 
06:04:52.878 --> 06:04:53.990 align:start position:0%
so that would be within that would
require

06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
require
 
06:04:57.430 --> 06:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
developers to notify the the pipeline
 
06:04:59.110 --> 06:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
existing pipeline in the state within a
 
06:05:02.230 --> 06:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
thousand feet of a proposed development
 
06:05:02.240 --> 06:05:03.510 align:start position:0%
thousand feet of a proposed development
so

06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:05.190 --> 06:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
this is good because by knowing where
 
06:05:06.788 --> 06:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
the pipeline is and how it's constructed
 
06:05:08.470 --> 06:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
developers will be able to modify their
 
06:05:10.470 --> 06:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
designs on new developments with the
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
location of the pipeline in mind
 
06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
and that's why you know i solicited
 
06:05:17.110 --> 06:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
advice from different groups and this
 
06:05:18.868 --> 06:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
this legislation is supported by new
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire home builders association as
 
06:05:23.030 --> 06:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a preemptive
 
06:05:24.548 --> 06:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
way to make sure that we're developing
 
06:05:25.910 --> 06:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
in a safe
 
06:05:25.920 --> 06:05:27.030 align:start position:0%
in a safe
way

06:05:27.030 --> 06:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:05:27.040 --> 06:05:28.708 align:start position:0%
way
so

06:05:28.708 --> 06:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:30.548 --> 06:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
it's forward thinking so currently
 
06:05:32.230 --> 06:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
there's really only there's only one
 
06:05:33.830 --> 06:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
interstate pipeline it's in northern new
 
06:05:33.840 --> 06:05:34.788 align:start position:0%
interstate pipeline it's in northern new
hampshire

06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
it goes through burlington through
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
berlin gorham and into maine it's about
 
06:05:41.030 --> 06:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
80 miles long so right now this bill
 
06:05:43.270 --> 06:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
would only affect that pipeline um but
 
06:05:45.350 --> 06:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
if in the future there are pipelines
 
06:05:47.430 --> 06:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
being constructed it would address
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
those as well
 
06:05:52.150 --> 06:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
so i i believe strongly that workforce
 
06:05:53.510 --> 06:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
housing development is very important
 
06:05:55.430 --> 06:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
issue facing new hampshire and it and i
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is going to be
 
06:05:58.708 --> 06:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
preemptive to help handle
 
06:06:00.230 --> 06:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
some of these issues
 
06:06:02.548 --> 06:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
and make sure that development that the
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
conversation is had before the shovel
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
breaks the ground on development and
 
06:06:08.628 --> 06:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
i have an amendment available i've
 
06:06:10.548 --> 06:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
solicited advice from the new hampshire
 
06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
municipal association who was originally
 
06:06:14.868 --> 06:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill um but the
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses their concerns and
 
06:06:19.030 --> 06:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
nature's behind me able to address that
 
06:06:20.548 --> 06:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
as well i'd be happy to hand that to the
 
06:06:23.110 --> 06:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
committee as well so in conclusion the
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
06:06:25.040 --> 06:06:25.830 align:start position:0%
amendment um
the

06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:06:28.230 --> 06:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
this bill you know has broad support
 
06:06:30.150 --> 06:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's a preemptive measure and allows for
 
06:06:31.990 --> 06:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
advanced notification so i asked the
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
06:06:36.390 --> 06:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
for your support on this bill thank you
 
06:06:37.910 --> 06:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for bringing
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
this important bill to us
 
06:06:41.670 --> 06:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
looks like an excellent bill i have one
 
06:06:44.070 --> 06:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
06:06:48.708 --> 06:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
for a new residential or non-residential
 
06:06:53.110 --> 06:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
development that is located in whole or
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
park within 1 000 feet of the center
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
point of a natural gas transmission
 
06:06:57.600 --> 06:06:59.350 align:start position:0%
point of a natural gas transmission
pipeline

06:06:59.350 --> 06:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
where did the number 1000 come from was
 
06:07:05.190 --> 06:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
that arbitrary arbitrarily chosen or is
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
there a is there some
 
06:07:07.440 --> 06:07:08.470 align:start position:0%
there a is there some
uh

06:07:08.470 --> 06:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:07:11.270 --> 06:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
safety guidelines or science behind that
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
number um thank you for the question
 
06:07:14.948 --> 06:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
06:07:17.990 --> 06:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
i was under the impression and i have um
 
06:07:20.310 --> 06:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
bj perry is here to help address it he's
 
06:07:22.868 --> 06:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
um lobbying for the only pipeline in new
 
06:07:25.270 --> 06:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire but um from the experiences of
 
06:07:26.788 --> 06:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
the pipeline companies most of the
 
06:07:29.030 --> 06:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
issues that come from the pipeline
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
really affect the the first thousand
 
06:07:34.948 --> 06:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
feet and after that um the safety
 
06:07:36.470 --> 06:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
the safety is affected within the first
 
06:07:38.150 --> 06:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
thousand feet and then after that um
 
06:07:40.470 --> 06:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
they can address it a little easier so
 
06:07:43.350 --> 06:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's where all the problems arise
 
06:07:45.350 --> 06:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
so the thousand feet comes from past
 
06:07:47.430 --> 06:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
experience with dealing with with these
 
06:07:48.868 --> 06:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
issues yes sir
 
06:07:51.350 --> 06:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
great thank you further questions uh
 
06:07:53.270 --> 06:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question
 
06:07:55.110 --> 06:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
06:07:57.190 --> 06:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
alexander representative alexander for
 
06:07:58.470 --> 06:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:08:00.788 --> 06:08:00.798 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of the bill is to
 
06:08:03.830 --> 06:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
institute requirements around notice
 
06:08:05.910 --> 06:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct yep
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so the the
 
06:08:10.470 --> 06:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
the permit shall not be issued unless
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
one of these three requirements are met
 
06:08:14.868 --> 06:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
so the developer has received written
 
06:08:16.708 --> 06:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
consent from a natural gas pipeline
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
operator number one or number two the
 
06:08:21.750 --> 06:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
developer has not received the consent
 
06:08:24.070 --> 06:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
but is filed with local land use board
 
06:08:25.990 --> 06:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
written correspondence from the pipeline
 
06:08:27.910 --> 06:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
operator demonstrating discussions have
 
06:08:30.310 --> 06:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
occurred or number three the developers
 
06:08:32.628 --> 06:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
filed dated and written correspondence
 
06:08:34.548 --> 06:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
with local land use boards that
 
06:08:36.470 --> 06:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrates attempts to contract the
 
06:08:39.990 --> 06:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
nitrogen pipeline operator so
 
06:08:41.350 --> 06:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
there's no way the pipeline company
 
06:08:43.670 --> 06:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
would be able to hinder the development
 
06:08:46.230 --> 06:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
um as long as the developer has
 
06:08:48.150 --> 06:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
documented advanced notification for the
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
pipeline being constructed okay thank
 
06:08:52.230 --> 06:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
you and follow-up follow-up uh and in
 
06:08:53.830 --> 06:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up you mentioned that there's an
 
06:08:56.070 --> 06:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that was that maybe patch
 
06:08:57.910 --> 06:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
would be speaking to after you
 
06:08:59.830 --> 06:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
or natch i'm sorry i always remember
 
06:09:01.990 --> 06:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
that it's pronounced like patch
 
06:09:05.190 --> 06:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
nate it is okay nate um
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that amendment so you're
 
06:09:09.270 --> 06:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
not going to present it and he's going
 
06:09:10.708 --> 06:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
to present it or you want to tell us
 
06:09:12.708 --> 06:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
what what it is the change that you're
 
06:09:15.350 --> 06:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
proposing yep so um i'm not a member of
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
the committee so i'll be happy to hand
 
06:09:17.670 --> 06:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
it to you and hopefully somebody on the
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee would be able to pick this up
 
06:09:21.750 --> 06:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
06:09:23.190 --> 06:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to keep one copy for
 
06:09:23.200 --> 06:09:25.270 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to keep one copy for
myself

06:09:25.270 --> 06:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
myself
 
06:09:26.788 --> 06:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
um so the amendment would do two things
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment would shift the
 
06:09:29.990 --> 06:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the notification of
 
06:09:31.510 --> 06:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
an application within a thousand feet of
 
06:09:33.510 --> 06:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
the pipeline from the local land use
 
06:09:35.030 --> 06:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
board to the developer so it would make
 
06:09:37.350 --> 06:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
the developer notify not the local land
 
06:09:39.910 --> 06:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
use board and that was a significant um
 
06:09:42.070 --> 06:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
concern with nhma and i believe that
 
06:09:43.910 --> 06:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
helps address the fiscal note because if
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
you look at the
 
06:09:45.200 --> 06:09:46.230 align:start position:0%
you look at the
um

06:09:46.230 --> 06:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
the methodology it basically says that
 
06:09:50.708 --> 06:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
there may be an indeterminable impact on
 
06:09:52.788 --> 06:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
local expenditures and it doesn't say
 
06:09:54.548 --> 06:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
whether the form of notices
 
06:09:56.230 --> 06:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
to pipeline operators are required so if
 
06:09:58.470 --> 06:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
you look at the methodology i i believe
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment fixes a lot of the
 
06:10:02.470 --> 06:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of this bill and i i
 
06:10:03.830 --> 06:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
believe it'd be
 
06:10:07.430 --> 06:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
negligible if any impact on it so that
 
06:10:09.190 --> 06:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
shift of responsibility and then number
 
06:10:10.948 --> 06:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
two the local land use boards shall make
 
06:10:12.948 --> 06:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
available the national national pipeline
 
06:10:15.430 --> 06:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
mapping system geospatial data which is
 
06:10:17.350 --> 06:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
already public information available for
 
06:10:17.360 --> 06:10:18.548 align:start position:0%
already public information available for
people

06:10:18.548 --> 06:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:10:20.708 --> 06:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
06:10:23.430 --> 06:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions for
 
06:10:25.190 --> 06:10:25.200 align:start position:0%

06:10:38.868 --> 06:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
is a great bill um i'm just curious
 
06:10:38.878 --> 06:10:40.150 align:start position:0%
is a great bill um i'm just curious
about

06:10:40.150 --> 06:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:10:40.160 --> 06:10:41.350 align:start position:0%

06:10:43.110 --> 06:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
what are the are there any current
 
06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions about
 
06:10:46.310 --> 06:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously this is about
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
notification but restrictions on how
 
06:10:52.070 --> 06:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
close a development can actually be to
 
06:10:53.990 --> 06:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
the pipeline
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
um i don't know the exact foot and i
 
06:10:57.590 --> 06:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak necessarily to
 
06:10:59.750 --> 06:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
buffer zone of of that i believe it's
 
06:11:02.628 --> 06:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
less than 100 feet though
 
06:11:03.990 --> 06:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
so but i have i have somebody here that
 
06:11:05.910 --> 06:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
can answer that for you
 
06:11:08.070 --> 06:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
06:11:10.150 --> 06:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
additional questions for representative
 
06:11:13.670 --> 06:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
alexander j.d bernardi is recognized
 
06:11:16.230 --> 06:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
06:11:19.030 --> 06:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
alexander uh how does this bill
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
interface uh with the requirements from
 
06:11:24.390 --> 06:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
dig safe
 
06:11:25.990 --> 06:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
um i believe this bill would comp
 
06:11:28.390 --> 06:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
complement the requirements and dig safe
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
so no no problems of
 
06:11:34.628 --> 06:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
um no if that's i'm i'm pretty sure
 
06:11:36.628 --> 06:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
digsafe is a national
 
06:11:38.948 --> 06:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
program so it says in here
 
06:11:41.430 --> 06:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
um that a natural gas transmission
 
06:11:43.510 --> 06:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
pipeline means an interstate pipeline as
 
06:11:46.430 --> 06:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
that term is divided in u.s code section
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
330115 so it says
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
um it complements digsafe it doesn't go
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
against xavier anyway thank you you're
 
06:11:53.280 --> 06:11:55.510 align:start position:0%
against xavier anyway thank you you're
welcome

06:11:55.510 --> 06:11:55.520 align:start position:0%

06:13:03.830 --> 06:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
for over 70 years tc energy formerly
 
06:13:05.510 --> 06:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
known as transcanada has been providing
 
06:13:07.190 --> 06:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
energy including natural gas to
 
06:13:09.430 --> 06:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
consumers across the continent in fact
 
06:13:11.510 --> 06:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
tc energy operates in 40 states here in
 
06:13:13.750 --> 06:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
the country and supplies more than 25
 
06:13:15.350 --> 06:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
percent of the natural gas demand in
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
north america
 
06:13:18.628 --> 06:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire our interstate pipeline
 
06:13:20.708 --> 06:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
spans 80 miles across coast county
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
connecting vermont and maine known as
 
06:13:24.390 --> 06:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
our portland natural gas transmission
 
06:13:26.470 --> 06:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
system this line transports nearly four
 
06:13:28.230 --> 06:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand decatharms and has
 
06:13:30.070 --> 06:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
helped provide new opportunities to
 
06:13:31.510 --> 06:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
providing energy and economic
 
06:13:31.520 --> 06:13:32.548 align:start position:0%
providing energy and economic
development

06:13:32.548 --> 06:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
development
 
06:13:34.070 --> 06:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
as some members of this committee might
 
06:13:35.510 --> 06:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
know our recent
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
hot tap tie-in project last summer up in
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
colebrook helped supply the necessary
 
06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure for the rubber
 
06:13:43.430 --> 06:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
glove manufacturing company that was
 
06:13:45.510 --> 06:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
awarded a multi-million dollar defense
 
06:13:48.230 --> 06:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
contract and will help create up to 300
 
06:13:50.628 --> 06:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
new jobs in the north country
 
06:13:52.150 --> 06:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
on a personal note as a lifelong
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
resident of new hampshire it was a great
 
06:13:55.590 --> 06:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
honor to be part of this accomplishment
 
06:13:57.590 --> 06:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
for our state and that's what tc energy
 
06:13:59.670 --> 06:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
is all about providing solutions and
 
06:14:01.350 --> 06:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
being part of some amazing programs that
 
06:14:02.868 --> 06:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
are making a difference
 
06:14:04.708 --> 06:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
to that point some of our other projects
 
06:14:06.548 --> 06:14:06.558 align:start position:0%
across north america include our evc
 
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
technology that converts methane to
 
06:14:11.030 --> 06:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
water vapor and co2 thus reducing ghg
 
06:14:12.868 --> 06:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
our saddlebrook double-sided solar panel
 
06:14:14.948 --> 06:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
project which can generate
 
06:14:17.590 --> 06:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
enough electricity to power 30 000 homes
 
06:14:19.830 --> 06:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
and tc energy's three mile canyon farm
 
06:14:21.590 --> 06:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
project over in oregon where the
 
06:14:23.430 --> 06:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
extraction of methane gas from the for
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
the manure of 33 000 dairy cows is
 
06:14:29.110 --> 06:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
occurring and rng is traveling to
 
06:14:31.590 --> 06:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
california via our interconnect pipeline
 
06:14:33.110 --> 06:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
system resulting in energy being
 
06:14:35.830 --> 06:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
provided to an energy-hungry state along
 
06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
with the avoidance of a hundred and
 
06:14:39.910 --> 06:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
thirty six thousand tons of co2 a year
 
06:14:41.990 --> 06:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
which translates to an annual ghg
 
06:14:45.190 --> 06:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
reduction of nearly 28 29 000 vehicles
 
06:14:47.030 --> 06:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
coming off the road
 
06:14:48.708 --> 06:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
along our commitment to new and
 
06:14:50.628 --> 06:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
sustainable energy is our commitment to
 
06:14:53.110 --> 06:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
safety and that is why i'm here today
 
06:14:54.948 --> 06:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
our pipeline safety programs are among
 
06:14:56.788 --> 06:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
the most robust in the industry and the
 
06:14:59.030 --> 06:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
most important part of our business one
 
06:15:00.470 --> 06:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the best demonstrations of our
 
06:15:02.310 --> 06:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
commitment to safety is our long
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
standing and ongoing pipeline integrity
 
06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
program this annual process maintains
 
06:15:08.628 --> 06:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
the integrity safety and reliable
 
06:15:10.948 --> 06:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
operations of our pipeline systems
 
06:15:12.948 --> 06:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
on top of this program every mile of
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
pipeline pump compressor facility or
 
06:15:17.190 --> 06:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
generation station is made using proven
 
06:15:19.030 --> 06:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
technology and integrated industry
 
06:15:21.270 --> 06:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
leading safety systems once constructed
 
06:15:22.628 --> 06:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
all pipelines and facilities are
 
06:15:24.628 --> 06:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
monitored constantly whether that's from
 
06:15:26.390 --> 06:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
inside the pipe on the ground or from
 
06:15:27.510 --> 06:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
the air
 
06:15:28.948 --> 06:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
we've invested more than a billion
 
06:15:30.390 --> 06:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
dollars in these programs and believe
 
06:15:32.070 --> 06:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
more can be done and that's why we're
 
06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
supporting and advocating for pipeline
 
06:15:36.390 --> 06:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
safety bills such as 1491.
 
06:15:38.230 --> 06:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
tc energy supports this important bill
 
06:15:39.590 --> 06:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
and believes its provisions increase
 
06:15:41.110 --> 06:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
public and operator safety while
 
06:15:43.190 --> 06:15:43.200 align:start position:0%
preventing the potential for damage to
 
06:15:44.708 --> 06:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
interstate natural gas transmission
 
06:15:46.868 --> 06:15:46.878 align:start position:0%
pipelines the communication framework
 
06:15:48.310 --> 06:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
established in this bill affords
 
06:15:50.230 --> 06:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
interstate pipeline operators the
 
06:15:51.990 --> 06:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
advanced data necessary to continue
 
06:15:53.430 --> 06:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
supporting the safe and reliable
 
06:15:57.430 --> 06:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
transportation of natural gas hb 1491
 
06:15:58.788 --> 06:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
promotes a heightened commitment to
 
06:16:00.708 --> 06:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
public and operator safety by requiring
 
06:16:02.548 --> 06:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
developers to provide gas transmission
 
06:16:03.990 --> 06:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
line operators with the advanced
 
06:16:05.990 --> 06:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
information needed to better adhere to
 
06:16:07.590 --> 06:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
the pipeline and hazardous materials
 
06:16:09.830 --> 06:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
safety administration guidelines
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
third-party damage generally caused
 
06:16:13.510 --> 06:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
during construction and excavation
 
06:16:15.110 --> 06:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
activities remain a leading cause of
 
06:16:17.510 --> 06:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
pipeline as incidents the communication
 
06:16:19.750 --> 06:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
framework established in 1491 greatly
 
06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
reduces the risk of third-party damage
 
06:16:23.910 --> 06:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
to pipeline infrastructure by requiring
 
06:16:26.070 --> 06:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
affected stakeholders the affected the
 
06:16:28.390 --> 06:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
interstate pipeline company that's me
 
06:16:30.548 --> 06:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
and and the developer to collaborate and
 
06:16:32.390 --> 06:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
exchange information at an earliest
 
06:16:34.390 --> 06:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
possible opportunity
 
06:16:35.270 --> 06:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
i hope
 
06:16:37.350 --> 06:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
my comments today answered in some of
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
your questions you might have and you
 
06:16:41.190 --> 06:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
learned a little bit more why we support
 
06:16:43.750 --> 06:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh 1491. i know you guys have all worked
 
06:16:45.350 --> 06:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
really hard today
 
06:16:46.470 --> 06:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
and we're the last thing up on the
 
06:16:48.470 --> 06:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
agenda so i'm happy to answer questions

now or later to about our commitment to
 
06:16:52.708 --> 06:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
safety and other tc energy programs you
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
might want to learn about to ensure we
 
06:16:57.430 --> 06:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
have the necessary information you need
 
06:16:57.440 --> 06:16:58.230 align:start position:0%
have the necessary information you need
when

06:16:58.230 --> 06:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:16:59.590 --> 06:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
making sure we're doing everything we
 
06:17:01.590 --> 06:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
can for pipeline safety i thank the
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
interested parties for speaking in favor
 
06:17:04.868 --> 06:17:04.878 align:start position:0%
of this bill and i appreciate your time
 
06:17:06.788 --> 06:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
not only to learn about pipeline safety
 
06:17:08.310 --> 06:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
but for all the hard work you do for the
 
06:17:10.230 --> 06:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire we can all agree
 
06:17:11.990 --> 06:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
that we're a special state and we are
 
06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
committed to safety community and all
 
06:17:16.868 --> 06:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
working together hb 1491 just does that
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
in true new hampshire fashion
 
06:17:22.230 --> 06:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr perry excellent
 
06:17:24.390 --> 06:17:24.400 align:start position:0%

yes thank you mr chair thank you for
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
addressing my question mr perry you want
 
06:17:30.948 --> 06:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
a mile a minute you were reading do you
 
06:17:33.670 --> 06:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
have uh that testimony
 
06:17:34.788 --> 06:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll be submitting it as well and
 
06:17:36.310 --> 06:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
emailing you guys as well thank you i'll
 
06:17:37.830 --> 06:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
look it up with my cell phone number

that's the best way to call me as well
 
06:17:41.030 --> 06:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine just as long as i have it so
 
06:17:42.868 --> 06:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
i can supplement right here
 
06:17:46.628 --> 06:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
um this bill is only a notification bill
 
06:17:49.990 --> 06:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
in no way it tries to uh increase what
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
you could uh you paid for right of way
 
06:17:55.030 --> 06:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh and so you paid for that you're
 
06:17:56.390 --> 06:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
not trying to expand it it's just
 
06:17:57.990 --> 06:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
notification now it's notification is
 
06:17:59.430 --> 06:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
because we're getting closer to the
 
06:18:01.430 --> 06:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
right of way let's have the discussion
 
06:18:03.910 --> 06:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
early let's have that the dialogue so
 
06:18:05.190 --> 06:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're ensuring that we're doing
 
06:18:07.830 --> 06:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
everything we can to you know working
 
06:18:09.830 --> 06:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
together for pipeline safety as well as
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
working together for development
 
06:18:12.948 --> 06:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
especially in these rural areas in new
 
06:18:12.958 --> 06:18:15.590 align:start position:0%
especially in these rural areas in new
hampshire

06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:17.270 --> 06:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
06:18:19.110 --> 06:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
representative alexander and his
 
06:18:21.670 --> 06:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
testimony alluded to the fact that in
 
06:18:21.680 --> 06:18:23.190 align:start position:0%
testimony alluded to the fact that in
tennessee

06:18:23.190 --> 06:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
tennessee
 
06:18:25.110 --> 06:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
some developers were
 
06:18:25.120 --> 06:18:26.548 align:start position:0%
some developers were
apparently

06:18:26.548 --> 06:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
06:18:29.830 --> 06:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
building houses as close as 16 feet from
 
06:18:32.310 --> 06:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
a natural gas pipeline could you explain
 
06:18:33.430 --> 06:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
to us
 
06:18:35.670 --> 06:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
what uh some of the
 
06:18:35.680 --> 06:18:36.470 align:start position:0%
what uh some of the
uh

06:18:36.470 --> 06:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:18:38.868 --> 06:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
safety hazards are in doing something
 
06:18:40.150 --> 06:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
like that i'll let you use your
 
06:18:42.628 --> 06:18:42.638 align:start position:0%
imagination uh but no that's in the
 
06:18:44.708 --> 06:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
state of pennsylvania uh in tennessee
 
06:18:46.390 --> 06:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
they were building in the backyards but
 
06:18:48.310 --> 06:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
i mean when you're encroaching right on
 
06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
that is some
 
06:18:51.030 --> 06:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
very very controversial things i mean
 
06:18:53.510 --> 06:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
because once again i'm talking about
 
06:18:55.110 --> 06:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
encroaching up to a thousand feet at the
 
06:18:57.110 --> 06:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
crosstalk right away i mean so if you're
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to
 
06:18:59.750 --> 06:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
dig a new pool if you're going to do
 
06:19:01.510 --> 06:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
something i mean you can you can ding
 
06:19:02.948 --> 06:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
the line and that's the last thing we
 
06:19:04.708 --> 06:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
want to do i mean because it's integrity
 
06:19:06.230 --> 06:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
and so forth now of course we pride
 
06:19:07.670 --> 06:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
ourselves on having one of the top
 
06:19:09.750 --> 06:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
safety commitments and you know of any
 
06:19:11.270 --> 06:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
energy company so we're johnny on the
 
06:19:12.468 --> 06:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
spot and we're going to be right there
 
06:19:14.390 --> 06:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we're our asset and
 
06:19:15.830 --> 06:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
retainability team is right there to do
 
06:19:17.670 --> 06:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
everything we can and work with to
 
06:19:19.270 --> 06:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
ensure safety and getting that line back
 
06:19:20.948 --> 06:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
up and running
 
06:19:20.958 --> 06:19:22.948 align:start position:0%
up and running
so

06:19:22.948 --> 06:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:19:26.390 --> 06:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
are there no setback requirements from
 
06:19:29.750 --> 06:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
pipeline right of ways
 
06:19:30.868 --> 06:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
you would have to talk to local
 
06:19:32.788 --> 06:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
authorities across the country and and
 
06:19:34.948 --> 06:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
so forth i mean so if we can have more
 
06:19:36.788 --> 06:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
dialogue and have more conversations to
 
06:19:39.030 --> 06:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
prevent this then let's do it that's why
 
06:19:41.350 --> 06:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
1491 is so important because it gets us
 
06:19:43.110 --> 06:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
right to the it gets right to the crux
 
06:19:45.110 --> 06:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
of the issue let's have a conversation
 
06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
let's get it done and let's ensure we
 
06:19:48.548 --> 06:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
have safety and we're having a great
 
06:19:50.230 --> 06:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
communication to put good new
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
development in the state of new
 
06:19:51.360 --> 06:19:52.548 align:start position:0%
development in the state of new
hampshire

06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:19:54.310 --> 06:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you representative
 
06:19:55.990 --> 06:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
thomas has a question
 
06:19:57.350 --> 06:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:20:00.948 --> 06:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
my question so explain to me um how much
 
06:20:02.788 --> 06:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
further this bill takes
 
06:20:02.798 --> 06:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
further this bill takes
um

06:20:03.750 --> 06:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:03.760 --> 06:20:04.468 align:start position:0%
um
us

06:20:04.468 --> 06:20:04.478 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:20:07.110 --> 06:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
more than what we currently have for the
 
06:20:09.030 --> 06:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
safe program so dig safe you know so
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
it's you know
 
06:20:12.230 --> 06:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
i hate one i really want to say the
 
06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
commercial in my head uh
 
06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not like i said i'm happy you
 
06:20:16.628 --> 06:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned it makes me happy by the way
 
06:20:18.150 --> 06:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
you guys are saying dig safe it makes me
 
06:20:19.190 --> 06:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
so happy to hear that because it's a
 
06:20:22.070 --> 06:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
great program uh great education program
 
06:20:24.150 --> 06:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
it helps us um
 
06:20:25.830 --> 06:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's it goes anywhere from based on
 
06:20:28.468 --> 06:20:28.478 align:start position:0%
local area it could be 25 to 150 feet
 
06:20:30.468 --> 06:20:30.478 align:start position:0%
from a right-of-way
 
06:20:32.150 --> 06:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
but once again as we ta as
 
06:20:33.750 --> 06:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
representative alexander alluded to and
 
06:20:35.590 --> 06:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
this people are putting you know not
 
06:20:37.910 --> 06:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
realizing where that line really is
 
06:20:39.270 --> 06:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
where is that easement where's that
 
06:20:40.868 --> 06:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
right-of-way and they're assuming that's
 
06:20:43.670 --> 06:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
their backyard so let's try to prevent
 
06:20:45.910 --> 06:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
that so that just adds a little bit more
 
06:20:47.430 --> 06:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know obviously it's a thousand feet
 
06:20:48.868 --> 06:20:48.878 align:start position:0%
because we'd like to have a little more
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
safety and have a little more
 
06:20:50.160 --> 06:20:51.350 align:start position:0%
safety and have a little more
conversation

06:20:51.350 --> 06:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
06:20:53.750 --> 06:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
but that's what we need to do
 
06:20:55.350 --> 06:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:20:57.830 --> 06:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so i know that in my town of
 
06:20:59.910 --> 06:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
londonderry there is i believe it's the
 
06:21:01.670 --> 06:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
concord lateral that runs through our
 
06:21:01.680 --> 06:21:03.030 align:start position:0%
concord lateral that runs through our
backyard

06:21:03.030 --> 06:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
06:21:04.628 --> 06:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
a few hundred feet off the back of our
 
06:21:06.150 --> 06:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
high school i believe
 
06:21:09.750 --> 06:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
but that area is in some parts is
 
06:21:11.510 --> 06:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
marked by these
 
06:21:14.390 --> 06:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
orange and white poles yes separated by
 
06:21:14.400 --> 06:21:15.430 align:start position:0%
orange and white poles yes separated by
us

06:21:15.430 --> 06:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:21:16.868 --> 06:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
some distance
 
06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
is that the right of way or can they get
 
06:21:22.948 --> 06:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
or is there some distance beyond those
 
06:21:24.868 --> 06:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
polls that people are not supposed to
 
06:21:26.310 --> 06:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
build anything beyond those polls and
 
06:21:27.910 --> 06:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
just every and just a reminder i would
 
06:21:29.670 --> 06:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
be uh very clear on this and you guys
 
06:21:30.788 --> 06:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
are great
 
06:21:32.468 --> 06:21:32.478 align:start position:0%
this is for interstate pipelines this
 
06:21:33.990 --> 06:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is affecting interstate
 
06:21:36.070 --> 06:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
pipelines so we're connecting so when
 
06:21:37.590 --> 06:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
we're at you know up and up in carlos
 
06:21:37.600 --> 06:21:38.948 align:start position:0%
we're at you know up and up in carlos

i see yeah so it's not so it's not other
 
06:21:42.390 --> 06:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
pipeline companies you know it's
 
06:21:43.910 --> 06:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
interstate pipelines and
 
06:21:45.510 --> 06:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
going through the state of new hampshire
 
06:21:46.628 --> 06:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
06:21:48.240 --> 06:21:50.948 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
question

06:21:50.948 --> 06:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:50.958 --> 06:21:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
when

06:21:51.830 --> 06:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:21:51.840 --> 06:21:53.990 align:start position:0%
when
someone

06:21:53.990 --> 06:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
someone
 
06:21:55.590 --> 06:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
builds a home
 
06:21:59.510 --> 06:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
they have to go through the local i
 
06:22:03.190 --> 06:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
believe the local planning boards or
 
06:22:05.910 --> 06:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
whatever controls building licensing
 
06:22:08.230 --> 06:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
permitting in their
 
06:22:10.468 --> 06:22:10.478 align:start position:0%
town or state
 
06:22:14.708 --> 06:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
in kolas county where you run through
 
06:22:17.910 --> 06:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:24.548 --> 06:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
pipeline to the appropriate
 
06:22:26.230 --> 06:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
town officials
 
06:22:28.948 --> 06:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
and to the county planning board
 
06:22:30.788 --> 06:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
that would be so i don't want to give
 
06:22:32.628 --> 06:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
you the wrong answer uh because that
 
06:22:34.230 --> 06:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
would be our land representatives who
 
06:22:36.788 --> 06:22:36.798 align:start position:0%
handle all of that for our company um it
 
06:22:38.628 --> 06:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
is readily accessible online we share
 
06:22:40.628 --> 06:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
those kmz's on a regular basis with
 
06:22:43.190 --> 06:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
anybody you know they can understand and
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
all those pipeline infrastructures are
 
06:22:48.868 --> 06:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:50.708 --> 06:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
but not but i'm happy to ensure to have
 
06:22:52.468 --> 06:22:52.478 align:start position:0%
my land representative reach out to you
 
06:22:54.070 --> 06:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
to walk you through our
 
06:22:55.670 --> 06:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
our process so you can understand that
 
06:22:56.868 --> 06:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
because the last thing i want to do is
 
06:22:59.830 --> 06:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
give you the wrong information
 
06:23:03.350 --> 06:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:06.868 --> 06:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
way back we had a house bill
 
06:23:10.548 --> 06:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
that had a pipeline safety committee and
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that we had was that
 
06:23:14.080 --> 06:23:14.948 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that we had was that
some

06:23:14.948 --> 06:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:23:17.110 --> 06:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
town officials especially new town
 
06:23:19.830 --> 06:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
officials or people who haven't lived in
 
06:23:22.868 --> 06:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
a town for a long time
 
06:23:22.878 --> 06:23:23.670 align:start position:0%
a town for a long time
would

06:23:23.670 --> 06:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:23:25.590 --> 06:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
maybe not aware
 
06:23:27.670 --> 06:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
of what was under their feet
 
06:23:29.750 --> 06:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why i
 
06:23:32.230 --> 06:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
i would like that information
 
06:23:34.788 --> 06:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
if these planning boards
 
06:23:34.798 --> 06:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
if these planning boards
and

06:23:35.750 --> 06:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:23:38.390 --> 06:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
proper land use authorities
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
have been notified and and i think
 
06:23:43.030 --> 06:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's really important no i think
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right and we like i
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
said we uh we constantly our land
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
representatives are constantly talking
 
06:23:49.830 --> 06:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
to local town officials uh on a regular
 
06:23:52.230 --> 06:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
basis uh such as as i referenced the uh
 
06:23:54.548 --> 06:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
the call the colebrook hot tap expansion
 
06:23:57.030 --> 06:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
the permit cost 16 and 18 cents uh and
 
06:23:58.548 --> 06:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
that you know it's you know and they
 
06:24:01.190 --> 06:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
were it was great and um it gave us the
 
06:24:02.548 --> 06:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
06:24:04.070 --> 06:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
share that information and as i
 
06:24:05.590 --> 06:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned we talked to land
 
06:24:05.600 --> 06:24:06.868 align:start position:0%
mentioned we talked to land
representatives

06:24:06.868 --> 06:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
06:24:08.468 --> 06:24:08.478 align:start position:0%
community relations we are talking to
 
06:24:10.230 --> 06:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
local people on a regular basis the
 
06:24:11.830 --> 06:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
first thing you guys saw that i did when
 
06:24:13.590 --> 06:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
i got to this committee i handed out an
 
06:24:15.430 --> 06:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
asset map of tc energy new hampshire so
 
06:24:17.110 --> 06:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
you guys saw that little blue line going
 
06:24:19.270 --> 06:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
across coast county uh you know giving
 
06:24:21.110 --> 06:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
you some key facts including the 4.6
 
06:24:22.548 --> 06:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
million dollars in property taxes that
 
06:24:24.948 --> 06:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
we pay um but you know it's the first
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
thing i did you know because you know
 
06:24:28.788 --> 06:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
traditionally it was if this was a tc
 
06:24:29.910 --> 06:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
energy meeting we'd start it with a
 
06:24:31.830 --> 06:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
safety moment uh you know veric because
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
safety is the number one most important
 
06:24:35.750 --> 06:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
thing to us so if my bosses are watching
 
06:24:36.868 --> 06:24:36.878 align:start position:0%
i'm probably going to get in trouble for
 
06:24:40.468 --> 06:24:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:42.548 --> 06:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
okay representative mirner is recognized
 
06:24:44.948 --> 06:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
for a question yes i happen to be the
 
06:24:46.468 --> 06:24:46.478 align:start position:0%
county planner for the unincorporated
 
06:24:47.750 --> 06:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
towns and everything up there and i can
 
06:24:50.868 --> 06:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
tell you we have detailed maps because
 
06:24:52.788 --> 06:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
the 4.6 million dollars you talk about
 
06:24:53.910 --> 06:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
06:24:56.548 --> 06:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
that's a big thing on the tax tax base
 
06:24:58.390 --> 06:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
utility tax bill we had that bill years
 
06:25:00.230 --> 06:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
ago because that was one of the biggest
 
06:25:02.070 --> 06:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
screaming from all my towns up there
 
06:25:03.270 --> 06:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
when we were
 
06:25:05.430 --> 06:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
kicking around 700 a few years ago
 
06:25:07.030 --> 06:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
because that was a big source of income
 
06:25:09.110 --> 06:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
for the towns up there
 
06:25:11.350 --> 06:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
so uh it is watched and wanted very
 
06:25:14.310 --> 06:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
closely by the towns
 
06:25:15.510 --> 06:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
did you have a question you wanted to
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
ask no i just wanted somebody had asked
 
06:25:19.590 --> 06:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
i was just answering callie jackie this
 
06:25:21.590 --> 06:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
06:25:27.270 --> 06:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:29.190 --> 06:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
perry thank you
 
06:25:30.400 --> 06:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
perry thank you
um

06:25:32.070 --> 06:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:34.628 --> 06:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
so you we were discussing previously
 
06:25:36.070 --> 06:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
this issue of
 
06:25:39.190 --> 06:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
why a thousand feet and we heard
 
06:25:41.830 --> 06:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
the thousand feet is
 
06:25:44.070 --> 06:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the largest area where there
 
06:25:45.030 --> 06:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
could be
 
06:25:46.390 --> 06:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
issues that
 
06:25:49.430 --> 06:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
may be damaging to the surrounding area
 
06:25:51.190 --> 06:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
could you kind of elaborate a little bit
 
06:25:53.590 --> 06:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
of what the typical
 
06:25:56.788 --> 06:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
problems could be in that thousand area
 
06:25:58.390 --> 06:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
distance it could be the same thing as
 
06:26:00.310 --> 06:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
we mentioned just you know why 8-1-1 is
 
06:26:01.830 --> 06:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
just as important it's you know it's
 
06:26:03.830 --> 06:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
basically you know it's it's 8-1-1 on
 
06:26:05.350 --> 06:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
steroids if you will to put it in a
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
better better way and it's ensuring that
 
06:26:09.110 --> 06:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know within that thousand feet i
 
06:26:10.948 --> 06:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
mean because think about how many how
 
06:26:12.310 --> 06:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
mean how many feet are we using in this
 
06:26:13.830 --> 06:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
building today you know would be would
 
06:26:15.270 --> 06:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
be you know if we were up in coast
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
county would be close to encroaching on
 
06:26:18.310 --> 06:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
the pipeline you know and that's not
 
06:26:19.350 --> 06:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
just the building it could be the
 
06:26:21.030 --> 06:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
parking lot it could be other things
 
06:26:22.548 --> 06:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
that are that are being addressed to the
 
06:26:25.190 --> 06:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
foundation etc so we want to ensure that
 
06:26:27.430 --> 06:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
we are giving plenty of room and the
 
06:26:28.868 --> 06:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
thing is and it could be
 
06:26:30.788 --> 06:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
remember it's a notification of up to a
 
06:26:32.390 --> 06:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
thousand feet we're not telling you to
 
06:26:33.590 --> 06:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
not do it from a thousand feet we're
 
06:26:35.270 --> 06:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
having conversations that if you're a
 
06:26:37.750 --> 06:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
thousand feet away let's review the plan
 
06:26:39.590 --> 06:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
collectively as a group and say oh no
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
your parking lot going over here your
 
06:26:43.030 --> 06:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
driveway okay that's good you know it's
 
06:26:44.708 --> 06:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
like we just want to give one more sense
 
06:26:47.110 --> 06:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
of safety excuse me mr perry my that was
 
06:26:49.110 --> 06:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
not my question my question was can you
 
06:26:51.190 --> 06:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
give us some examples
 
06:26:53.590 --> 06:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
of when there have been problems
 
06:26:56.390 --> 06:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
associated with natural gas pipelines
 
06:26:58.150 --> 06:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
where where people were saying a
 
06:26:59.750 --> 06:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
thousand feet that's kind of a good
 
06:27:01.670 --> 06:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
distance where we can be sure that
 
06:27:03.750 --> 06:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
whatever happens people will be safe
 
06:27:06.070 --> 06:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
sure can you give us some some examples
 
06:27:08.708 --> 06:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
of what could happen not to say i'm not
 
06:27:11.190 --> 06:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
implying that it does all the time i'm
 
06:27:12.310 --> 06:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
just saying
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
some area some examples of why a
 
06:27:16.468 --> 06:27:16.478 align:start position:0%
thousand feet would be useful some of it
 
06:27:19.030 --> 06:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
is is regulatory reformed you know with
 
06:27:21.110 --> 06:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
with fisma um and you know as i
 
06:27:22.548 --> 06:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned the pipeline hazardous
 
06:27:24.548 --> 06:27:24.558 align:start position:0%
material safety administration under uh
 
06:27:27.430 --> 06:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
d.o.t uh so some of that is based on
 
06:27:29.990 --> 06:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
their numbers and then um
 
06:27:31.670 --> 06:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
as we alluded it's
 
06:27:33.750 --> 06:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
just ensuring more dialogue more
 
06:27:36.390 --> 06:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
conversation and just making sure i
 
06:27:38.150 --> 06:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't want to give you examples and put
 
06:27:39.670 --> 06:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
things into your head that you know
 
06:27:41.990 --> 06:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
could or could not happen um that's not
 
06:27:43.510 --> 06:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
what i'm
 
06:27:44.948 --> 06:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
i don't want to do that to be honest
 
06:27:46.548 --> 06:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
with you you know or lead you down a
 
06:27:48.150 --> 06:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
road that you're thinking something else
 
06:27:49.830 --> 06:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm here to encourage advanced
 
06:27:51.750 --> 06:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
notification legislation to prevent
 
06:27:53.670 --> 06:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
safety and i'd like i said on the
 
06:27:55.830 --> 06:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory side i'm happy to put you in
 
06:27:57.510 --> 06:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
conversations with our regulatory people
 
06:27:59.270 --> 06:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
to help you better understand well i
 
06:28:00.948 --> 06:28:00.958 align:start position:0%
still haven't heard an answer to the
 
06:28:03.270 --> 06:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
question of what incidents may have
 
06:28:03.280 --> 06:28:04.548 align:start position:0%
question of what incidents may have
happened

06:28:04.548 --> 06:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
happened
 
06:28:06.548 --> 06:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh representative substitute did give
 
06:28:08.708 --> 06:28:08.718 align:start position:0%
you any no he didn't answer yes he did
 
06:28:10.390 --> 06:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
he said he's not going to give you
 
06:28:10.400 --> 06:28:11.910 align:start position:0%
he said he's not going to give you
examples

06:28:11.910 --> 06:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
examples
 
06:28:14.230 --> 06:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
of what could or could not happen so
 
06:28:15.670 --> 06:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
let's move on let me ask a follow-up
 
06:28:17.590 --> 06:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
question different from what this all
 
06:28:19.430 --> 06:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
right make sure it's different
 
06:28:21.270 --> 06:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to inquire whether your
 
06:28:24.788 --> 06:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
company has in any way been considering
 
06:28:28.070 --> 06:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh the idea of transporting
 
06:28:30.628 --> 06:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
not just methane but hydrogen in your
 
06:28:32.948 --> 06:28:32.958 align:start position:0%
pipelines or a mixture of the two i know
 
06:28:35.190 --> 06:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
some utilities are doing that already
 
06:28:36.788 --> 06:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of conversations utility
 
06:28:38.390 --> 06:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
companies and energy companies that are
 
06:28:41.030 --> 06:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
having that absolutely absolutely i mean
 
06:28:42.868 --> 06:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
tc energy prides itself on looking at
 
06:28:45.430 --> 06:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
all forms of energy it's who we are it's
 
06:28:47.030 --> 06:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
what we do i mean we
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned we we are not afraid to
 
06:28:51.430 --> 06:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
explore all forms of energy double-sided
 
06:28:54.708 --> 06:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
solar panels uh hydrogen uh
 
06:28:57.110 --> 06:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
renewable natural gas hydro we'll have
 
06:28:58.868 --> 06:28:58.878 align:start position:0%
those conversations because
 
06:29:01.190 --> 06:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know when we're paying 163 more in
 
06:29:03.110 --> 06:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
energy costs up in this area let's have
 
06:29:05.270 --> 06:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
a conversation about energy okay thank
 
06:29:07.750 --> 06:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
you good good response representative
 
06:29:11.030 --> 06:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
partial is recognized for a question

drafted uh i do have a question and that
 
06:29:20.868 --> 06:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
is um
 
06:29:22.310 --> 06:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
looking it over
 
06:29:24.868 --> 06:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
understanding this is for interstate uh
 
06:29:26.868 --> 06:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
that they made that clear but is this
 
06:29:29.430 --> 06:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
for development for new
 
06:29:32.468 --> 06:29:32.478 align:start position:0%
developments or if i have an existing
 
06:29:32.478 --> 06:29:34.708 align:start position:0%
developments or if i have an existing
um

in order to make me aware of this
 
06:30:01.590 --> 06:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
situation well your building permit is
 
06:30:02.788 --> 06:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
go is it will be handled through your
 
06:30:04.948 --> 06:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
building through your local authority uh

developments uh in the area and i just
 
06:30:11.030 --> 06:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
use the pools to try to give a general
 
06:30:13.510 --> 06:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
example uh new developments going up in
 
06:30:16.070 --> 06:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
new construction uh along in interstate
 
06:30:18.070 --> 06:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
along an interstate pipeline
 
06:30:19.510 --> 06:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay so it doesn't apply to existing
 
06:30:19.520 --> 06:30:20.868 align:start position:0%
okay so it doesn't apply to existing
constructions

06:30:20.868 --> 06:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
constructions
 
06:30:22.948 --> 06:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you thank you
 
06:30:24.948 --> 06:30:24.958 align:start position:0%

collaborative efforts here in this in
 
06:30:47.190 --> 06:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
the 603 that i would uh bring it to new
 
06:30:47.200 --> 06:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
the 603 that i would uh bring it to new
hampshire

06:30:49.190 --> 06:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:30:51.510 --> 06:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
great idea representative bernardi has a
 
06:30:51.520 --> 06:30:53.670 align:start position:0%
great idea representative bernardi has a
question

06:30:53.670 --> 06:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:30:56.948 --> 06:30:56.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh mr perry what
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
type of markers exist on top of
 
06:31:00.240 --> 06:31:01.190 align:start position:0%
type of markers exist on top of
this

06:31:01.190 --> 06:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:31:05.030 --> 06:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
interstate pipeline to to give someone a
 
06:31:07.670 --> 06:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
visual that hey i may be a thousand feet
 
06:31:09.670 --> 06:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
and i better ask somebody
 
06:31:11.750 --> 06:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh currently uh the the markers that are
 
06:31:13.350 --> 06:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
indicated are
 
06:31:15.350 --> 06:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
along the root of our pipeline
 
06:31:17.270 --> 06:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
so this is where you would work with uh
 
06:31:19.430 --> 06:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
because i mean it could be a thousand
 
06:31:21.510 --> 06:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
feet could be going through
 
06:31:23.830 --> 06:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know existing field of some sort but
 
06:31:26.230 --> 06:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
having the conversation and getting the
 
06:31:29.030 --> 06:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
kmz file will determine exactly from the
 
06:31:30.548 --> 06:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
existence of the pipeline where those
 
06:31:32.310 --> 06:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
yellow markers are that we've indicated
 
06:31:33.990 --> 06:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
and seen and you're welcome to come up
 
06:31:37.030 --> 06:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
to coast county and uh represent and i
 
06:31:38.230 --> 06:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
will give you a nice little tour of it
 
06:31:40.230 --> 06:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
come come come come see come and see it
 
06:31:41.910 --> 06:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we'll go to the golf course
 
06:31:43.830 --> 06:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
too um
 
06:31:45.590 --> 06:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see you'll see the yellow markers
 
06:31:47.910 --> 06:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
and then from there it's a thousand feet
 
06:31:50.070 --> 06:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
from that pipeline
 
06:31:51.430 --> 06:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:31:53.510 --> 06:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question
 
06:31:55.190 --> 06:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
06:31:56.868 --> 06:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
perry for taking my question
 
06:31:58.390 --> 06:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
06:31:59.990 --> 06:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
based on the language in here it says to
 
06:32:01.350 --> 06:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
the center line of the pipeline a
 
06:32:02.868 --> 06:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
thousand feet so that would be two
 
06:32:04.708 --> 06:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
thousand feet right one thousand on each
 
06:32:07.110 --> 06:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
side right so it's actually two thousand
 
06:32:09.510 --> 06:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
feet times eighty miles
 
06:32:11.830 --> 06:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's quite a bit of land that
 
06:32:14.628 --> 06:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
you're talking about here so
 
06:32:17.830 --> 06:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh are you aware of any current projects
 
06:32:19.750 --> 06:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
in coast county that would be impacted
 
06:32:21.350 --> 06:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
by the implementation of this law
 
06:32:23.350 --> 06:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
because i'm not curious not to my
 
06:32:24.628 --> 06:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
understanding of course when we had the
 
06:32:26.548 --> 06:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
conversation with
 
06:32:28.628 --> 06:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
renko the rubber glove manufacturing
 
06:32:30.628 --> 06:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
company we had
 
06:32:32.788 --> 06:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
dialogue from the get-go uh to ensure
 
06:32:34.310 --> 06:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
that everything was
 
06:32:36.150 --> 06:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know integrity safety and everything
 
06:32:37.510 --> 06:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
was ready to go and that we could have
 
06:32:39.430 --> 06:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
the demand ready to go for them so we
 
06:32:41.270 --> 06:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
could help create 300 new jobs and you
 
06:32:43.030 --> 06:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
know for their 95 000 square foot
 
06:32:44.628 --> 06:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
edition that they put on yeah there was
 
06:32:47.910 --> 06:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
95 000 that was the facility 90 or 95.
 
06:32:50.548 --> 06:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
just to follow on follow up yeah so so
 
06:32:52.390 --> 06:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
you it you've had this interstate
 
06:32:53.910 --> 06:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
pipeline for a while so i'm sure you
 
06:32:55.590 --> 06:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
know who your neighbors are i guess the
 
06:32:57.430 --> 06:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
better question would be
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any um
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
businesses or land owners along the
 
06:33:05.430 --> 06:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
pipeline route that would be affected by
 
06:33:05.440 --> 06:33:06.150 align:start position:0%
pipeline route that would be affected by
this

06:33:06.150 --> 06:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:33:06.160 --> 06:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
this
uh

06:33:07.110 --> 06:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:33:08.628 --> 06:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know i would say if they sell that
 
06:33:10.310 --> 06:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
property you know and then they somebody
 
06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
wants to put a development and that's
 
06:33:13.030 --> 06:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
the whole point of the legislation is
 
06:33:14.310 --> 06:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
that we can take those preventative
 
06:33:15.510 --> 06:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
measures and have those advanced
 
06:33:17.590 --> 06:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
conversations so if i sold i owned
 
06:33:19.750 --> 06:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
parcels of land up in say gorham for
 
06:33:21.670 --> 06:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
example and i decided to sell them to
 
06:33:23.750 --> 06:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know a you know abc development
 
06:33:25.190 --> 06:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
company and they want to put something
 
06:33:26.948 --> 06:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
the advanced notification legislation
 
06:33:28.788 --> 06:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
will would kick into effect to make sure
 
06:33:31.830 --> 06:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
that you know tc energy hi and uh and
 
06:33:33.270 --> 06:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
abc building development will have a
 
06:33:35.270 --> 06:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
conversation so we can ensure safety and
 
06:33:36.948 --> 06:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
integrity and land conservation and
 
06:33:38.310 --> 06:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
preservation in the state of new
 
06:33:38.320 --> 06:33:40.070 align:start position:0%
preservation in the state of new
hampshire

06:33:40.070 --> 06:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:33:40.080 --> 06:33:41.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire
okay

06:33:41.910 --> 06:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:33:41.920 --> 06:33:42.708 align:start position:0%
okay
so

06:33:42.708 --> 06:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:33:45.510 --> 06:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
could you explain on page two
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
starting at line three section five
 
06:33:50.150 --> 06:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
it says upon receiving notice of a
 
06:33:51.910 --> 06:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
planned development in accordance with
 
06:33:54.070 --> 06:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
this section a pipeline operator shall
 
06:33:57.270 --> 06:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
locate and mark the natural gas pipeline
 
06:33:57.280 --> 06:33:58.708 align:start position:0%
locate and mark the natural gas pipeline
facilities

06:33:58.708 --> 06:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
06:34:00.868 --> 06:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
and provide pipeline facility
 
06:34:03.190 --> 06:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
information to the developer
 
06:34:05.990 --> 06:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
by other means such as marking up design
 
06:34:08.390 --> 06:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
drawings and providing maps does that
 
06:34:08.400 --> 06:34:09.190 align:start position:0%
drawings and providing maps does that
mean

06:34:09.190 --> 06:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
mean
 
06:34:10.788 --> 06:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
both physically
 
06:34:13.750 --> 06:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
on the ground as well as on design
 
06:34:15.590 --> 06:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
drawings is that the purpose of that
 
06:34:15.600 --> 06:34:16.468 align:start position:0%
drawings is that the purpose of that
absolutely

06:34:16.468 --> 06:34:16.478 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
06:34:18.070 --> 06:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely let's just have let's cover
 
06:34:20.788 --> 06:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
one more line to ensure one more value
 
06:34:22.390 --> 06:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
to safety you know just you know just
 
06:34:23.510 --> 06:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
like when digsafe comes in and they're
 
06:34:24.708 --> 06:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
putting the lines on the ground
 
06:34:26.548 --> 06:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's just giving us
 
06:34:28.628 --> 06:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
one more time here's your drawing here
 
06:34:31.030 --> 06:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
it is yeah you just saw it in person
 
06:34:33.190 --> 06:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative callie
 
06:34:34.868 --> 06:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
pitts has another question i have a
 
06:34:39.110 --> 06:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:41.990 --> 06:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
who controls
 
06:34:45.670 --> 06:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
these things on an interstate pipeline
 
06:34:48.628 --> 06:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
pipelines have been in the news lately
 
06:34:52.070 --> 06:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
are there different control factors
 
06:34:54.788 --> 06:34:54.798 align:start position:0%
for interstate
 
06:34:57.270 --> 06:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
versus entrusting yeah i mean it's all
 
06:34:58.868 --> 06:34:58.878 align:start position:0%
classifications and so forth and how
 
06:35:00.390 --> 06:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're regulated and we're regulated by
 
06:35:02.948 --> 06:35:02.958 align:start position:0%
ferc that's what i thought so
 
06:35:02.958 --> 06:35:04.788 align:start position:0%
ferc that's what i thought so
may

06:35:04.788 --> 06:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
may
 
06:35:07.110 --> 06:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
my follow-up would be is
 
06:35:09.270 --> 06:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
can we
 
06:35:09.280 --> 06:35:11.830 align:start position:0%
can we
legitimately

06:35:11.830 --> 06:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
legitimately
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
put these regulations into effect
 
06:35:18.390 --> 06:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
because they can be super see
 
06:35:20.948 --> 06:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
can they be superseded
 
06:35:22.310 --> 06:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
by ferc
 
06:35:24.150 --> 06:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
so the conversation is about advanced
 
06:35:26.948 --> 06:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
notification legislation for act for
 
06:35:28.868 --> 06:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
them to obtain a permit
 
06:35:30.948 --> 06:35:30.958 align:start position:0%
a state permit a local municipal permit
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
that is that is issued by them so it's
 
06:35:34.548 --> 06:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
the town i mean as you as you indicated
 
06:35:36.390 --> 06:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
and members indicated earlier it's the
 
06:35:37.830 --> 06:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
communities that issue the building
 
06:35:37.840 --> 06:35:39.350 align:start position:0%
communities that issue the building
permits

06:35:39.350 --> 06:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
permits
 
06:35:41.430 --> 06:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
so we're having the dialogue here to add
 
06:35:43.430 --> 06:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
one more bite of safety so we can so
 
06:35:45.110 --> 06:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
they can get that permit
 
06:35:48.150 --> 06:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
the local building permit
 
06:35:50.310 --> 06:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
so the answer is no ferc wouldn't uh
 
06:35:52.390 --> 06:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
have any effect we pass it in tennessee
 
06:35:54.390 --> 06:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's in ohio and we're and we're and
 
06:35:55.430 --> 06:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're moving for and we're moving
 
06:35:57.030 --> 06:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
forward in new hampshire and hopefully
 
06:35:57.040 --> 06:35:58.310 align:start position:0%
forward in new hampshire and hopefully
kentucky

06:35:58.310 --> 06:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
kentucky
 
06:36:00.390 --> 06:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
06:36:02.708 --> 06:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um my question is
 
06:36:04.390 --> 06:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
really not germane to this i'll take it
 
06:36:04.400 --> 06:36:06.310 align:start position:0%
really not germane to this i'll take it
offline

06:36:06.310 --> 06:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
offline
 
06:36:09.270 --> 06:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for recognizing that
 
06:36:10.948 --> 06:36:10.958 align:start position:0%
any additional ques representative
 
06:36:13.510 --> 06:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
thomas has a question thank you chair
 
06:36:15.750 --> 06:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh i'll assume i'm filling in for
 
06:36:17.830 --> 06:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative lucky's question
 
06:36:20.070 --> 06:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh since i already asked two of them
 
06:36:20.080 --> 06:36:21.110 align:start position:0%
uh since i already asked two of them
um

06:36:21.110 --> 06:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:24.310 --> 06:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
it certainly came to my mind does this
 
06:36:24.320 --> 06:36:26.548 align:start position:0%
it certainly came to my mind does this
legislation

06:36:26.548 --> 06:36:26.558 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:36:28.230 --> 06:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
would this pre uh legislation
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
effectively put
 
06:36:29.760 --> 06:36:30.788 align:start position:0%
effectively put
uh

06:36:30.788 --> 06:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:36:33.110 --> 06:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
i guess tc energy in a position where
 
06:36:34.390 --> 06:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
they could
 
06:36:37.670 --> 06:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
effectively deny a permit no
 
06:36:40.390 --> 06:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
no it's it's creating conversation to
 
06:36:42.788 --> 06:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
ensure conversation where you know we're
 
06:36:44.868 --> 06:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
not the local planning authority it's it
 
06:36:46.708 --> 06:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
is the attempt of the of the person who
 
06:36:48.230 --> 06:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
wants to do development to have
 
06:36:50.230 --> 06:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
conversation and dialogue with us to
 
06:36:51.990 --> 06:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
ensure they know where the pipeline is
 
06:36:53.830 --> 06:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
for pipeline safety
 
06:36:53.840 --> 06:36:54.708 align:start position:0%
for pipeline safety
so

06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:54.718 --> 06:36:55.670 align:start position:0%
so
follow-up

06:36:55.670 --> 06:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
so uh not to
 
06:37:00.230 --> 06:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
reiterate but then again so
 
06:37:02.788 --> 06:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh the local planning board could still
 
06:37:05.270 --> 06:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh overrule your objection
 
06:37:05.280 --> 06:37:06.390 align:start position:0%
uh overrule your objection
um

06:37:06.390 --> 06:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
on that and and if they did is is there
 
06:37:10.150 --> 06:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
any recourse we're not objecting
 
06:37:12.070 --> 06:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
remember our role in this is to have a
 
06:37:13.990 --> 06:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
dialogue of conversation relative to
 
06:37:15.510 --> 06:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
where they're building in the pipeline
 
06:37:18.070 --> 06:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
and provide feedback and information
 
06:37:19.910 --> 06:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
as it relates to regulations as it
 
06:37:22.310 --> 06:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
relates to fisma classifications so they
 
06:37:23.670 --> 06:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
know when they're building where it's
 
06:37:26.230 --> 06:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
going to be you know the uh the the the
 
06:37:28.310 --> 06:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
yay or nays our and our role is
 
06:37:30.948 --> 06:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
supplying them as indicated in this bill
 
06:37:32.788 --> 06:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
the mapping ability
 
06:37:34.628 --> 06:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
the plotting and where it is and where's
 
06:37:36.628 --> 06:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
a thousand feet from it
 
06:37:37.830 --> 06:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
so that but it goes back to the
 
06:37:39.990 --> 06:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
authority of the local planning board
 
06:37:42.230 --> 06:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
and obtaining their permit
 
06:37:43.350 --> 06:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
we're just having we're having the
 
06:37:45.030 --> 06:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
dialogue of conversation for you know
 
06:37:48.150 --> 06:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
for safety and integrity thank you
 
06:37:50.230 --> 06:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay we uh
 
06:37:52.150 --> 06:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
we've got two more people who who want
 
06:37:54.230 --> 06:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
to testify here so
 
06:37:57.030 --> 06:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh make it quick uh representative mcgee
 
06:37:58.788 --> 06:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
i will do so thank you for indulging me
 
06:38:00.868 --> 06:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
06:38:03.270 --> 06:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
when i'm looking at uh the place that
 
06:38:04.868 --> 06:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
says the
 
06:38:06.708 --> 06:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the local land use
 
06:38:09.830 --> 06:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
board this is on page two uh
 
06:38:12.390 --> 06:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
section six and i'm looking
 
06:38:13.830 --> 06:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
at number a
 
06:38:16.390 --> 06:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
it says um the board uh
 
06:38:17.830 --> 06:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
she'll basically
 
06:38:20.708 --> 06:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction
 
06:38:20.718 --> 06:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction
to

06:38:22.390 --> 06:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:38:25.110 --> 06:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
allow a building permit
 
06:38:27.110 --> 06:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
if the developer has received written
 
06:38:28.948 --> 06:38:28.958 align:start position:0%
consent from the natural gas pipeline
 
06:38:30.788 --> 06:38:30.798 align:start position:0%
operator that
 
06:38:32.788 --> 06:38:32.798 align:start position:0%
has filed this consent with such
 
06:38:34.628 --> 06:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
regional planning commission and then it
 
06:38:36.468 --> 06:38:36.478 align:start position:0%
goes on to say or these other things
 
06:38:38.788 --> 06:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
right so you can have reached out sure
 
06:38:40.468 --> 06:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
and not have heard back yet and you know
 
06:38:41.910 --> 06:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
so you're trying to cover all
 
06:38:43.910 --> 06:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
contingencies but it does
 
06:38:45.910 --> 06:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
give the pipeline company the ability to
 
06:38:48.310 --> 06:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
respond and say no right yeah we give
 
06:38:49.590 --> 06:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
our advice and say no but you know but
 
06:38:51.190 --> 06:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
that but that is not our authority our
 
06:38:53.670 --> 06:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
our intent here is to ensure that we are
 
06:38:55.350 --> 06:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
working with the the developer of this
 
06:38:57.510 --> 06:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
piece of property to ensure they know
 
06:38:59.270 --> 06:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
where the interstate pipeline is so we
 
06:39:01.030 --> 06:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
can ensure safety and integrity that's
 
06:39:02.788 --> 06:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
the crux of the bill we're not you know
 
06:39:03.830 --> 06:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're not going to prevent
 
06:39:05.750 --> 06:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
economic development from happening from
 
06:39:07.510 --> 06:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
more housing coming into play we don't
 
06:39:08.788 --> 06:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
want that that's why we played a key
 
06:39:10.468 --> 06:39:10.478 align:start position:0%
role in the colebrook hot tap project to
 
06:39:13.270 --> 06:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
allow 300 new jobs
 
06:39:14.868 --> 06:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
we could eliminate that if we wanted to
 
06:39:17.030 --> 06:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
then that you know this is your bill um
 
06:39:19.030 --> 06:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know i i'm here to talk you know why
 
06:39:20.948 --> 06:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
we're advocating for this bill on a
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
safety and integrity matter okay thank
 
06:39:24.230 --> 06:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
you so now thank you i appreciate it
 
06:39:25.830 --> 06:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
06:39:27.510 --> 06:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
so representative mcgee are you
 
06:39:30.948 --> 06:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
advocating that we change the word
 
06:39:30.958 --> 06:39:32.150 align:start position:0%
advocating that we change the word
shall

06:39:32.150 --> 06:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
shall
 
06:39:37.590 --> 06:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:41.030 --> 06:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
a building permit shall not be issued
 
06:39:42.868 --> 06:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
should we change that to may not be
 
06:39:44.628 --> 06:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
issued unless the following one of the
 
06:39:46.868 --> 06:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
following three conditions is met yeah i
 
06:39:48.468 --> 06:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
don't know if that helps it
 
06:39:50.468 --> 06:39:50.478 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that solves for what i'm
 
06:39:51.990 --> 06:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
talking about yeah
 
06:39:54.390 --> 06:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
what are you saying jackie
 
06:39:56.150 --> 06:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
all right well we can discuss this later
 
06:39:58.788 --> 06:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to understand what your
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
question was uh the point i'm making is
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
that there's an explicit item here that
 
06:40:05.590 --> 06:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
says that we would be granting the that
 
06:40:07.430 --> 06:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
the developer has received written
 
06:40:10.070 --> 06:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
consent from the natural gas pipeline
 
06:40:11.910 --> 06:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
operator and has filed this consent with
 
06:40:13.990 --> 06:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
the regional planning board so if that
 
06:40:15.510 --> 06:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
consent isn't given then that would
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
prevent development right
 
06:40:21.190 --> 06:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
unless one of the other two right
 
06:40:23.910 --> 06:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
conditions is met but you're right yes
 
06:40:26.628 --> 06:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
which is why i suggested that
 
06:40:29.110 --> 06:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
we may want to make it advisory rather
 
06:40:30.868 --> 06:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
than uh
 
06:40:31.910 --> 06:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
make it
 
06:40:33.990 --> 06:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory yeah we should consider that
 
06:40:35.670 --> 06:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
anyway okay
 
06:40:38.548 --> 06:40:38.558 align:start position:0%
we got to move on here so i'm going to
 
06:40:38.558 --> 06:40:39.350 align:start position:0%
we got to move on here so i'm going to
thank

06:40:39.350 --> 06:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:40:41.910 --> 06:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
mr perry for his
 
06:40:44.708 --> 06:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
his excellent testimony and
 
06:40:44.718 --> 06:40:46.070 align:start position:0%
his excellent testimony and
excellent

06:40:46.070 --> 06:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
06:40:47.910 --> 06:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
answers to his questions
 
06:40:50.788 --> 06:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
and called nate grays from the new new
 
06:40:52.830 --> 06:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association to
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
testify on
 
06:40:58.390 --> 06:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation mr grays
 
06:41:00.230 --> 06:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate graves for the
 
06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
06:41:06.830 --> 06:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:07.910 --> 06:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
06:41:09.430 --> 06:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative alexander already
 
06:41:10.948 --> 06:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
described the amendment would just
 
06:41:10.958 --> 06:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
described the amendment would just
change

06:41:11.990 --> 06:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
06:41:14.150 --> 06:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
slightly how this operates which would
 
06:41:16.310 --> 06:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
save some municipal costs
 
06:41:18.468 --> 06:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
i guess the best way
 
06:41:20.150 --> 06:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
to think about this bill or the way i
 
06:41:21.270 --> 06:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
think about it at least is it
 
06:41:23.110 --> 06:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
essentially makes the pipeline operator
 
06:41:25.510 --> 06:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
in a butter if the pipeline is within a
 
06:41:27.030 --> 06:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
thousand feet of the property to be
 
06:41:27.040 --> 06:41:28.868 align:start position:0%
thousand feet of the property to be
developed

06:41:28.868 --> 06:41:28.878 align:start position:0%
developed
 
06:41:29.910 --> 06:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
essentially what that would do was
 
06:41:35.110 --> 06:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
require notification just like any other
 
06:41:37.350 --> 06:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
butter and so the pipeline operator
 
06:41:39.030 --> 06:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
should come in and describe whether
 
06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a problem so for example if
 
06:41:43.510 --> 06:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone was going to take a pool on top
 
06:41:45.430 --> 06:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
of where the pipeline is running through
 
06:41:47.030 --> 06:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a problem if
 
06:41:48.868 --> 06:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
someone's going to do blasting within a
 
06:41:50.708 --> 06:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
thousand feet that's probably going to
 
06:41:52.310 --> 06:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
be a problem
 
06:41:53.830 --> 06:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
but if they're just going to pave a
 
06:41:57.110 --> 06:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
parking lot that may not be a problem
 
06:41:59.350 --> 06:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
but in either case or whatever the case
 
06:42:01.510 --> 06:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
may be it gives the pipeline operator
 
06:42:03.830 --> 06:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to inform the planning
 
06:42:03.840 --> 06:42:04.948 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to inform the planning
board

06:42:04.948 --> 06:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:42:07.110 --> 06:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so we don't have any accidents and
 
06:42:08.708 --> 06:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
so that's what
 
06:42:10.708 --> 06:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
my thought about how this bill operates
 
06:42:13.270 --> 06:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
is and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
06:42:16.868 --> 06:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent description of
 
06:42:18.390 --> 06:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
the bill in
 
06:42:20.310 --> 06:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
its essence are there any further
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:28.868 --> 06:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:31.350 --> 06:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
i have a question about the the thousand
 
06:42:34.070 --> 06:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
feet and and the issue of a butters if
 
06:42:36.788 --> 06:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
if property lines they're not always
 
06:42:38.628 --> 06:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
nice neat rectangles
 
06:42:40.708 --> 06:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
and someone could own
 
06:42:44.230 --> 06:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know 40 feet at the at the back end
 
06:42:45.910 --> 06:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
and they're separated by someone else
 
06:42:47.910 --> 06:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
who is the a butter so you're not the
 
06:42:49.670 --> 06:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
abutter but you're within a thousand
 
06:42:52.310 --> 06:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
feet are they going to be informed
 
06:42:53.590 --> 06:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a way for them to
 
06:42:55.350 --> 06:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
be informed if they're buying the
 
06:42:56.548 --> 06:42:56.558 align:start position:0%
property and they're thinking they're
 
06:42:59.830 --> 06:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
going to do something with those 40
 
06:43:02.390 --> 06:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
so it would it would be
 
06:43:04.230 --> 06:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
the way this would work is if they
 
06:43:05.910 --> 06:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
propose a development so if they're just
 
06:43:08.070 --> 06:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
buying the property unless the owner
 
06:43:10.310 --> 06:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
tells them or they look out and see the
 
06:43:12.230 --> 06:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
yellow stakes or whatever
 
06:43:14.070 --> 06:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
no but presumably they they know where
 
06:43:15.350 --> 06:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
their property is presumably they've
 
06:43:17.190 --> 06:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
walked around before buying it
 
06:43:17.200 --> 06:43:18.390 align:start position:0%
walked around before buying it
um

06:43:18.390 --> 06:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:20.788 --> 06:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
but my assumption would be that you know
 
06:43:22.948 --> 06:43:22.958 align:start position:0%
if it's their property and then another
 
06:43:24.708 --> 06:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
property in the pipeline and they want
 
06:43:26.468 --> 06:43:26.478 align:start position:0%
to dig a pool or whatever
 
06:43:28.310 --> 06:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
when they notify the pipeline the
 
06:43:29.590 --> 06:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
pipeline's going to look at the same
 
06:43:31.190 --> 06:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
maps everybody else's and say that's not
 
06:43:32.788 --> 06:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
an issue and let them know it's not
 
06:43:34.070 --> 06:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
going to be an issue because clearly
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're building they're
 
06:43:37.350 --> 06:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
building on their property not next to
 
06:43:39.110 --> 06:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
the pipeline so that's my assumption of
 
06:43:40.468 --> 06:43:40.478 align:start position:0%
how it would work
 
06:43:41.910 --> 06:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't hear an objection from
 
06:43:43.590 --> 06:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
the pipeline at the planning board
 
06:43:43.600 --> 06:43:47.750 align:start position:0%
the pipeline at the planning board
session

06:43:47.750 --> 06:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:49.830 --> 06:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
06:43:51.910 --> 06:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you
 
06:43:54.150 --> 06:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
mr grace for taking my question
 
06:43:55.830 --> 06:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to ask whether you could
 
06:43:58.788 --> 06:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment that i had asked
 
06:44:00.628 --> 06:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
prior speakers to speak to just tell me
 
06:44:02.468 --> 06:44:02.478 align:start position:0%
what it in essence what you're trying to
 
06:44:05.350 --> 06:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
do with this so it makes two changes um
 
06:44:07.670 --> 06:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
one it places the burden of notification
 
06:44:09.030 --> 06:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
on the applicant rather than the land
 
06:44:11.430 --> 06:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
use board that's consistent with
 
06:44:13.750 --> 06:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
the statutes related to abutters
 
06:44:15.590 --> 06:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
although it is often the case that land
 
06:44:17.190 --> 06:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
use boards will
 
06:44:18.708 --> 06:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
make the list of a butters in
 
06:44:20.230 --> 06:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the applicant and
 
06:44:22.548 --> 06:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
provide that notice upon payment of the
 
06:44:22.558 --> 06:44:23.430 align:start position:0%
provide that notice upon payment of the
fee

06:44:23.430 --> 06:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
fee
 
06:44:25.830 --> 06:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
presumably that's going to happen here
 
06:44:27.430 --> 06:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
the other change
 
06:44:30.070 --> 06:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
um which is to section four
 
06:44:32.310 --> 06:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
is it just changes uh
 
06:44:35.350 --> 06:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
the effect of the bill as a whole
 
06:44:37.030 --> 06:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
the bill as a whole
 
06:44:39.030 --> 06:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
to those municipalities that actually
 
06:44:41.190 --> 06:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
have a pipeline or which may have a
 
06:44:42.628 --> 06:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
pipeline in the future because it
 
06:44:44.628 --> 06:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense for
 
06:44:46.468 --> 06:44:46.478 align:start position:0%
a municipality without an interstate
 
06:44:48.310 --> 06:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
pipeline to have to
 
06:44:51.110 --> 06:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
look at these maps and you know actually
 
06:44:52.390 --> 06:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
do work on this
 
06:44:54.070 --> 06:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
but it does make sense if you actually
 
06:44:55.910 --> 06:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a pipeline or if in the future a
 
06:44:58.230 --> 06:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
pipeline goes through
 
06:45:01.110 --> 06:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
um just follow up follow up so
 
06:45:02.948 --> 06:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
the the notice on the applicant how
 
06:45:04.868 --> 06:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
would that work
 
06:45:04.878 --> 06:45:05.670 align:start position:0%
would that work
so

06:45:05.670 --> 06:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:45:08.468 --> 06:45:08.478 align:start position:0%
the applicant would have to notify the
 
06:45:11.030 --> 06:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
um the pipeline operator
 
06:45:13.510 --> 06:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
who has presumably provided information
 
06:45:16.230 --> 06:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
to the municipality um and worked with
 
06:45:18.830 --> 06:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
the municipality to
 
06:45:22.788 --> 06:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
um to to have this information available
 
06:45:24.230 --> 06:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering how the how the
 
06:45:25.830 --> 06:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
applicant might know
 
06:45:25.840 --> 06:45:26.628 align:start position:0%
applicant might know
who

06:45:26.628 --> 06:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:45:28.548 --> 06:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
to notify
 
06:45:30.628 --> 06:45:30.638 align:start position:0%
i believe that information is available
 
06:45:32.468 --> 06:45:32.478 align:start position:0%
through the national
 
06:45:34.948 --> 06:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
pipeline mapping
 
06:45:37.590 --> 06:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
npms whatever the whatever the acronym
 
06:45:40.788 --> 06:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
stands for the national pipeline mapping
 
06:45:40.798 --> 06:45:42.628 align:start position:0%
stands for the national pipeline mapping
system

06:45:42.628 --> 06:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:45:44.628 --> 06:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
i believe that contact information is
 
06:45:49.030 --> 06:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:50.788 --> 06:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
for clarification then
 
06:45:52.948 --> 06:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
i without this amendment
 
06:45:55.670 --> 06:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh section 4 would require every town in
 
06:45:58.548 --> 06:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
the state to
 
06:46:00.548 --> 06:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
make national pipeline mapping system
 
06:46:03.190 --> 06:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
geospace should be geospatial data
 
06:46:03.200 --> 06:46:04.468 align:start position:0%
geospace should be geospatial data
available

06:46:04.468 --> 06:46:04.478 align:start position:0%
available
 
06:46:04.478 --> 06:46:05.350 align:start position:0%
available
uh

06:46:05.350 --> 06:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:46:07.750 --> 06:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
in its town in its jurisdiction is that
 
06:46:07.760 --> 06:46:09.030 align:start position:0%
in its town in its jurisdiction is that
correct

06:46:09.030 --> 06:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:46:11.190 --> 06:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
so this is a fairly significant change
 
06:46:13.830 --> 06:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
then it is okay thank you and i would
 
06:46:16.390 --> 06:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
defer to the pipeline operators sitting
 
06:46:18.390 --> 06:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
behind me about how that
 
06:46:20.070 --> 06:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
that information would be available to
 
06:46:20.080 --> 06:46:21.510 align:start position:0%
that information would be available to
applicants

06:46:21.510 --> 06:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
06:46:25.190 --> 06:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:27.510 --> 06:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
just my convoluted mind thinking if i
 
06:46:29.030 --> 06:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
own property
 
06:46:30.628 --> 06:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
and i own
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
enough acreage that a
 
06:46:36.230 --> 06:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
pipeline is beneath that property
 
06:46:39.030 --> 06:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
and that property
 
06:46:41.990 --> 06:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
due to the pipeline is
 
06:46:42.000 --> 06:46:43.430 align:start position:0%
due to the pipeline is
deemed

06:46:43.430 --> 06:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
deemed
 
06:46:43.440 --> 06:46:45.350 align:start position:0%
deemed
unbuildable

06:46:45.350 --> 06:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
unbuildable
 
06:46:48.310 --> 06:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
would then the pipeline
 
06:46:51.910 --> 06:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
operator have to pay or buy an easement
 
06:46:53.430 --> 06:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
on that property
 
06:46:54.628 --> 06:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
because that
 
06:46:57.430 --> 06:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
or is that taking of property by eminent
 
06:46:57.440 --> 06:46:58.788 align:start position:0%
or is that taking of property by eminent
domain

06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
domain
 
06:47:01.590 --> 06:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
because now my property cannot be built
 
06:47:04.150 --> 06:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
on or subdivided or whatever well that's
 
06:47:06.948 --> 06:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
going to be a private dispute between
 
06:47:09.030 --> 06:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
the property owner and the
 
06:47:10.948 --> 06:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
and the pipeline operator that would not
 
06:47:13.110 --> 06:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
involve the municipality so i couldn't
 
06:47:19.350 --> 06:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:21.510 --> 06:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh he's not the right person to answer
 
06:47:23.750 --> 06:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
that question mr roberge from the
 
06:47:26.230 --> 06:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy is here to answer
 
06:47:26.240 --> 06:47:27.350 align:start position:0%
department of energy is here to answer
questions

06:47:27.350 --> 06:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:47:27.360 --> 06:47:28.390 align:start position:0%
questions
i'll

06:47:28.390 --> 06:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
06:47:30.390 --> 06:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
ask him maybe if he could answer that
 
06:47:30.400 --> 06:47:33.670 align:start position:0%
ask him maybe if he could answer that
question

06:47:33.670 --> 06:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:33.680 --> 06:47:40.468 align:start position:0%
 
now

06:47:40.468 --> 06:47:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:42.230 --> 06:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
well just say yes or no i can answer
 
06:47:44.788 --> 06:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
that question
 
06:47:46.868 --> 06:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we won't call you up then
 
06:47:48.708 --> 06:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
to answer that question
 
06:47:51.190 --> 06:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
all right uh he doesn't he can't answer
 
06:47:52.548 --> 06:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
the question so
 
06:47:52.558 --> 06:47:53.430 align:start position:0%
the question so
maybe

06:47:53.430 --> 06:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
06:47:55.910 --> 06:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
the two gentlemen from
 
06:47:55.920 --> 06:47:57.110 align:start position:0%
the two gentlemen from
who

06:47:57.110 --> 06:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:47:59.990 --> 06:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
either mr perry from t c energy or
 
06:48:01.750 --> 06:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative alexander could answer
 
06:48:03.110 --> 06:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
the question
 
06:48:04.948 --> 06:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
either one of you want to take a stab at
 
06:48:04.958 --> 06:48:06.948 align:start position:0%
either one of you want to take a stab at
it

06:48:06.948 --> 06:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:48:09.510 --> 06:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
come up to the mic please
 
06:48:11.510 --> 06:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
some circumstances similar to what you
 
06:48:14.070 --> 06:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know that would be a
 
06:48:16.468 --> 06:48:16.478 align:start position:0%
conversation that you know a company
 
06:48:19.270 --> 06:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
could potentially have with a uh with a
 
06:48:21.190 --> 06:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
with a property owner you know in
 
06:48:23.670 --> 06:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
obtaining or purchasing or uh that piece
 
06:48:26.310 --> 06:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
of property you know so and if you want
 
06:48:28.548 --> 06:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
for further clarity on that i can i can
 
06:48:30.150 --> 06:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to like i said i'll put you in
 
06:48:33.030 --> 06:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
contact with the uh the uh
 
06:48:34.468 --> 06:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
the people who who can answer those
 
06:48:36.390 --> 06:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions on our land rep team because
 
06:48:37.430 --> 06:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know they're they're going to give
 
06:48:39.590 --> 06:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
it to you and and if people know me when
 
06:48:41.270 --> 06:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
i say i'm going to do something i do it
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
so absolutely happy to do it
 
06:48:46.628 --> 06:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
it's good it's good it's good dialogue
 
06:48:48.310 --> 06:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
06:48:50.468 --> 06:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
who do you want to direct actually i can
 
06:48:53.350 --> 06:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
clarify on that if we would like
 
06:48:55.270 --> 06:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
in the case of an existing pipeline
 
06:48:57.430 --> 06:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
there already is an easement on the land
 
06:48:59.910 --> 06:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
and it is in the deed for the land
 
06:49:01.510 --> 06:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
a new pipeline would be a different
 
06:49:01.520 --> 06:49:02.948 align:start position:0%
a new pipeline would be a different
matter

06:49:02.948 --> 06:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
matter
 
06:49:05.430 --> 06:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:49:07.590 --> 06:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:49:09.830 --> 06:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
06:49:11.910 --> 06:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think we've exhausted all the
 
06:49:14.150 --> 06:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions for these gentlemen i
 
06:49:14.160 --> 06:49:15.350 align:start position:0%
questions for these gentlemen i
appreciate

06:49:15.350 --> 06:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
06:49:17.750 --> 06:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
mr graves being here from the municipal
 
06:49:20.468 --> 06:49:20.478 align:start position:0%
association the only card i have left is
 
06:49:20.478 --> 06:49:22.150 align:start position:0%
association the only card i have left is
from

06:49:22.150 --> 06:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:49:25.510 --> 06:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
mr roberge from the department of energy
 
06:49:27.350 --> 06:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
does anybody think they have a question
 
06:49:29.910 --> 06:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
that they might like to ask him at this
 
06:49:29.920 --> 06:49:33.110 align:start position:0%
that they might like to ask him at this
point

06:49:33.110 --> 06:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:35.270 --> 06:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none i would like to ask him how
 
06:49:38.390 --> 06:49:38.400 align:start position:0%

yes yes on wednesday the the 16th we're
 
06:51:56.070 --> 06:51:56.080 align:start position:0%

06:51:59.110 --> 06:51:59.120 align:start position:0%

06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that they're going to
 
06:52:38.948 --> 06:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
restrict it just to the house and the
 
06:52:41.590 --> 06:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
senate this year because of the ongoing
 
06:52:44.310 --> 06:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
coveted safety measures so there will be
 
06:52:46.390 --> 06:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
no executive council there will be no
 
06:52:48.788 --> 06:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
supreme court justices and i don't
 
06:52:51.110 --> 06:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
believe there will be any other vips
 
06:52:54.150 --> 06:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
