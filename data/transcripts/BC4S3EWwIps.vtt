p.m. I'm going to actually pass around
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
the committee contact list I I forgot
 
00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 align:start position:0%
last time I announced it but didn't pass
 
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
it so again just please cross out your
 
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
name if you do not want your contact
 
00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 align:start position:0%
information shared just with the
 
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee so I will pass it this
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
way so one other quick thing I wanted to
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
mention is in order to make the very
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
best use of our time in committee the
 
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
chair has decided not to have the clerk
 
00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 align:start position:0%
call roll call attendance due to the
 
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
fact that a quorum is not needed for
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
public hearings however the clerk does
 
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
record attendance um at the beginning of
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
executive sessions which is not
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
applicable for today and I do believe
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
that the ranking member is in agreement
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
so as I said we're here and we're going
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
to have public hearings on on 10 bills
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
so in order to stay on schedule the
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
chair will allow for up to 5 minutes for
 
00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
Bill introductions followed by questions
 
00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:02.990 align:start position:0%
Bill introductions followed by questions
and

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
answers and the chair will also allow up
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
to three minutes for in-person public
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
testimony with additional time allowed
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
allows if we have a lot of pink cards
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
for for a particular Bill the chair the
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
vice chair will keep track of time he's
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
in the meeting right now that's why I
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
the veterans
 
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh these are two groups that have
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
incomes that are normally limited and
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
have a low propensity to be able to add
 
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
income unless they get a job uh and at
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
that age and uh and sometimes with the
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities of a of a veteran they're
 
00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
limited on the type of jobs that they
 
00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:47.310 align:start position:0%

can

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
elderly and the Veterans for their
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%

you know uh care for the
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
community this B Bill benefits both the
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
municipality uh and the volunteer the
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
community gets help uh in areas that
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
they have limited uh support such as in
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
the community centers as in with the
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
area beautification admin or in event
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
planning for certain events for certain
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
things within the community um the
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
volunteer gets the benefit of
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
interaction with the personnel within
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
the community plus they also get a sense
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
of Pride for working with the
 
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.829 align:start position:0%
of Pride for working with the
community

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh so as of right now uh as a quick
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
search I found uh five places five
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
states that do offer something of this
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
sort uh Mass Main New York Oregon and
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania uh again this is a uh
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
enabling bill so the communities can
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
choose to adopt or not to adopt uh the
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
monies would have to be put into an
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
overlay just as he would for veterans
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
credit and to uh support that um deficit
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
the other benefit that you could also uh
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
say that this would be is it helps
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
reduce the
 
00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:14.509 align:start position:0%

representative Walker yes thank you
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh so they get 725 an
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
hour until it adds up to
 
00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
1500 but how
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
the expense of keeping track of it all
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
who's going to do that in the
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
municipality and why you know I did yeah
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question uh
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
representative um so the the
 
00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping should be at the location
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
where they're actually doing the
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
volunteerism and if that were to shift
 
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
then their record should shift to the
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
other entity that they're working at uh
 
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
and I I believe 725 is a little bit low
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
I I would probably recommend going a
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
little bit higher just to
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
I know it says 725 yes correct but I I
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you representative for
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh this bill also
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
needs a an amendment I believe under uh
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
because it's added a reference to RSA 72
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
39- c which this committee found in
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislate okay um well I know it's
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
supposed to amend the 70 it 72 39 yep 39
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
C uh which which would go in there so
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's the amend amendment of that
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
correct and when was this
 
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
found was one of our first
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
110 I believe this is the first I've
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
seen it on the
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
docket but no I'm I'm talking about
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
another bill oh okay that we I believe
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
it was one representative Gilman the the
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
reference here in the bill is to uh a
 
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
statute and not a
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill correct but they've added into the
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
bill into this um into this Bill a
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
reference to uh RSA that we already
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
found an expedient to legislate in HB
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
grundt thank you madam chairwoman thank
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um to add on
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
to what representative Walker was saying
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
in small smaller towns like things like
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
so we have an Amherst Garden Club that
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
takes care of all the gardens around
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
town There's No location that of anybody
 
00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
tracking who's working where so I think
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
the concern of we have people
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
volunteering we have people who help
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
take care of trails in our town people
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's no central location would add a
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
cost to these towns for someone to sign
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
off and verify this work's being done so
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
the question is what kind of Burden
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
would that add to a town if they're not
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
prepared for that thank you for the
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
question I I don't think it would be
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
that great of a burden and and maybe um
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
because they have to register by the
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
first of April to say that they're going
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
to be using this incentive so it would
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
either be have to be through the um
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
admin section or the the uh Finance
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
section of of the M municipality Andor
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
office because I only say the assessors
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
only because they would keep track of
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
the proper the and and finance will keep
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
track of the the taxes
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
so additional questions representative
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
frock thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
representative um mine is a two-part
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
question if I may uh firstly I am aware
 
00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:52.230 align:start position:0%
question if I may uh firstly I am aware
of

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
many uh tax exemptions that are
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
available to disabled veterans
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
and I think veterans in general and I'm
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is in addition to or
 
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.670 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is in addition to or
instead

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
of uh thank you for your question
 
00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh this would be an
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
addition to okay M may I ask my second
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
part there are a lot of towns and a lot
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
of older people and Veterans who have a
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
knowledge through their life experience
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
through their work
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
whatever um why would this bill not
 
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
apply to people who volunteer their
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
times their time to serve on the many
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
Boards thank you for that question uh
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
the committee's uh boards and and uh
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
advisory uh those are those are elected
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
positions or positions that are people
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
have applied for so that would not be
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
part of this because um you would think
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
right because you need more people we're
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
we're short on some of our boards and
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
everything it would incentivize people
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
to to get involved
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
but that's that's
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
their they do that those boards and
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
committees for a reason and those
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
reasons is to help the community and
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
being an elected or an appointed
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
official is not the same as saying I'm
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to volunteer down and imp plant
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
flowers or help with an event planning
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
so I mean they're they're they're there
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
to strictly guide and and direct the
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
town in certain directions to make them
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
better whereas a volunteer is there to
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
help in those processes to get the town
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
there sure
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair um on page

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
11 uh States qualifying persons while
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%

00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
be considered employees of their city or
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%

31
 
00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:26.190 align:start position:0%
31
um

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
what what do you have any idea what the
 
00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
effective insurance is um the additional
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
costs that maybe a municipality would
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
have to take on um or training that the
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh employee volunteer would have to go
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
through uh thank you for your question
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
um I do not know the if there would be
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
any extra cost because I think it would
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
just be covered under um comprehensive
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
or Andor
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
um injury um
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
injury uh Insurance whatever so I don't
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
think there would be much of an increase
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
all further questions represent oh
 
00:19:12.159 --> 00:19:13.430 align:start position:0%
all further questions represent oh
representative

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you madam chairman and
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
relative to the followup with uh
 
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.310 align:start position:0%
relative to the followup with uh
representative

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
Colby's question about being an
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
employee um would they be issued aen 99
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
by the
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
town thank you for your question I I do
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
not believe so since this is a it's not
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
they're not getting paid they're only
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
getting an abatement or a or a tax
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
incentive so it's not like they're
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
getting a physical paycheck and the the
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm trying to remember where the
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
break line is for
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
a1099 um I don't know if it's if it's
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
900 or a th000 600 600 so but they're
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
not getting an actual pay they're
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
getting a deduction in their tax so it's
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
it it would not be a 10 to9 1099 in my
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
opinion thank
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chairwoman and I
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
I think I'm piling on with the same
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
question is is I'm I just don't
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
understand why they even need to be
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
employees and curious if that was your
 
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
language or if that was recommended by
 
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.789 align:start position:0%
language or if that was recommended by
ol

00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799 align:start position:0%
ol
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I believe
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
that was that was that was not my
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
language that was inserted in there but
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
I mean You' have to look at that as okay
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
they should have the same um not
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
benefits but the same knowledge that
 
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
this person if someone were to come up
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
to him say hey what are you doing here
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm working for the city
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
helping them do this and you know so
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
that would I think it's more about
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
recognition than it is you know and in
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
purposes followup I don't usually do
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
follow-ups thank you so does that mean
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
that the volunteer would have to be
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
working in conjunction with something
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
that the town or city
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
recognizes as as volunteer or can they
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer for something else
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
non-affiliated and and submit that as
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
qualifying volunteer time does that make
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
sense yes yes thank you for your
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
question um now it has to be in line
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
with what the what the city has so if
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
you have a a part-time spot within the
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
community center and you want to have
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
someone go in there and check IDs or or
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
you know collect monies and things like
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
that um if you have a uh a group that
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
does area
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
beautification um that's sponsored by
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
the city then you know they could
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
participate in that if have an event
 
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
planning process or or team that's
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the city then they could be
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
involved in that but it has to be in
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
with the city's purview thank
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chair I have a
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
correction and a question um the bill
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
that I was referring to earlier was uh
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
HB 101 which we have not made an
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
executive decision on um
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
then the question
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
is there is there reference in here
 
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.230 align:start position:0%
is there is there reference in here
regarding

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
um personal information that um
 
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
no the chair recognizes representative
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair woman uh at
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
what point would a volunteer position
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
cross into becoming an employee for
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
example um someone volunteers to clear
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
sidewalks maybe they're using a city
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle to do that damage cause what
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
point is an person an employee versus a
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
volunteer thank you for the question um
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think that for one the
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
volunteer will be driving any any City
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles um because that would be higher
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
liability and the training I'm sure
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
depending on any pickup truck or a car
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
yes sure that's fine but there's still
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
liabilities and they still have to be I
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
know in the military we have to be
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
certified on on whatever we drive
 
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
whether it be a a a Coleman lantern or
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
or a lawn mower or whatever we still
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed on that uh and
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
improve training so um I don't foresee
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
that that would would happen and if that
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
did then they would probably have to go
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
off the volunteerism incentive and move
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
into a part-time position or a full-time
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
position and that would relieve the city
 
00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
question so you got the April 1
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
deadline excuse me so if I sign up for
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
this before April 1st but I don't do any
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer work till it's warm like May
 
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
or June do they get the tax credit and
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
they just you're hoping they work it off
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
or uh they have to wait till the
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
following year thank you for your
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
question you have to wait until you
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
actually do the work uh because it's
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
it's on a cost per hour basis so as as
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
once you start you can sign up in April
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
and say you're going to do it but
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
nothing may be available because you're
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
not you don't like to shovel snow or
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
whatever and you'd rather mow Lawns or
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
or you know trim so you wouldn't you
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any uh cost shearing into
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
that until you actually do the work on
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
an hourly basis and then that's kept
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
track to and when you reach that limit
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
then You' get your incentive on your tax
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
bill further
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question question um
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
again uh I'm just trying to understand
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
the difference between an employee and a
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
volunteer would an employee if we are
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
treated them as
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
employees would the employee
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
town be applicable to the
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
volunteer um for instance background
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
checks uh or um drug test testing
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
or um anything else that a municipality
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
may require from their employees thank
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
you for the question um if by chance
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's where they needed that person
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
then I would suppose so but I would I
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
would anticipate that most of the
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
volunteerism would be in areas that do
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
do not have to worry about those types
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
of background checks and and uh other
 
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.039 align:start position:0%
training that they may need um because
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
you're looking at you know Community
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
Center um um maybe helping out on on an
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
event down at the park you know that's
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
City sponsored or you know those types
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
of things so it's I don't foresee that
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
positions the chair recognizes
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy for a
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's actually a two-part isn't this a
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
form of Bing and what are the IRS
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
implications of this thank you for your
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
I suppose you could call a type of
 
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
bartering um I do not know what the IRS
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh um impact on this would be because
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're getting you're getting a a
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
discount on
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
your um your your property tax so you
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
don't really report that to the IRS
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
and you can also I mean but you're
 
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
getting you're getting an incentive so
 
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.909 align:start position:0%
getting you're getting an incentive so
could

00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
you put that in as a charitable donation
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
on your IRS I would say you have to TA
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
talk to a tax attorney on that um but
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
with the thresholds being so high and
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
being an elderly and a and and a veteran
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
uh probably you wouldn't reach the
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
threshold to do a itemized
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
deduction and you'd probably end up
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
taking a standard deduction so there
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be much but again I
 
00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:56.919 align:start position:0%
would I would consult with a tax
 
00:27:56.919 --> 00:27:59.389 align:start position:0%
would I would consult with a tax
attorney

00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:27:59.399 --> 00:28:01.669 align:start position:0%
attorney
additional

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none oh representative
 
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.389 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none oh representative
um

00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
Colby uh just for clarification on page
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
one um I would say lines 8 through 12
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
the it states no resident shall receive
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
a total property tax credit greater than
 
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
1500 but yet it can be
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
combined with any additional credit or
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
exemption that they already qualify for
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
so if my municipality has a
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
$750 all veterans tax
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
credit is the
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
total that they're
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to achieve 1500 so that veteran
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
would only be entitled to another
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
750 uh to get
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
to I'm just confused as to the the
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
language so one says total greater
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
than but it has to be in addition to in
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
a combination with okay thank you for
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
your question and thank God your your
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
municipality gives 750 for the veterans
 
00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
credit if they do um so this is this is
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
a in addition to so they get the 1500
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
plus the 750 so thank you yes thank
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
you further questions seeing none thank
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
government that's better um thank you uh
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
committee chair and committee members uh
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Jim misho I'm Chief assessor
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
for the town of Hudson uh want to make
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
clear that my testimony not just on this
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
bill but on all the bills I'm going to
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
testify on today do not necessarily
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
represent the viewpoints the board of
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
selectman for Hudson uh they haven't
 
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
registered any opinion on these bills to
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
date so um consistent with prior
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
testimony on bills this year and in
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
Prior sessions I usually um testify to
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
the technical administration of these
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
bills um I do have written testimony I
 
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
will not uh go over verbally all of the
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
written testimony um but the first point
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
um deals with a weakness in the bill and
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
that's um how many different variations
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
of these volunteer tax credits there can
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
be so when you think about what you uh
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
work with at the local level you have a
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
veterans credit of
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
$500 um you have a double veterans
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
credit of a th000 those are defined
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
amounts this at $1,500 Max is$
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
150,000 different variations of a tax
 
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
credit right if you can fractionalize an
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
hour and and you come up with all these
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
different combinations
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
our Mass appraisal systems software
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
systems they can't handle that many
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
different combinations um your tax
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
collection software that also cannot
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
handle that many different combinations
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
so if this was structured that it was
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
more finite if I put in 10 hours it
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
would be a $250 credit flat right
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
something that we can um easily more
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
easily have in a bucket right so imagine
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
that these are buckets in the two
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
different software systems um they're
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
just not set up to handle all the
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
different combinations that this would
 
00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:33.350 align:start position:0%
different combinations that this would
entail

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
um it states that it's a tax credit for
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
veteran and elderly um but it's not just
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
veteran and elderly there's references
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
to disabled veterans totally and
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
permanently disabled there's references
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
to disabled uh people that are social
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
security disabled so um I don't know if
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
additional language to clarify that
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
right in one part it says this and
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
another part it expands on
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
it um I think someone touched on this uh
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
vol ER volunteer tax credits um would
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
this deplete existing committees and
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
boards that people serve on which they
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
do not get compensation and they might
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
turn around and say I think I'll leave
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
this and do some volunteering you know
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
might that have an impact upon um your
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
local efforts to fulfill your Municipal
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
boards and committees um an unattended
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
impact possible um as far as limiting
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
the overall fiscal impact of the program
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
so in Hudson we have about 1273
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
between veterans credits elderly
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
exemptions totally and perly disabled if
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
just half of those folks uh put in a
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer effort at $1,500 that would be
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
almost a million dollars in tax credit
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
that would be shifted over to all the
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
other taxpayers in the community um it
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't decrease the amount of money as
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
we know locally right it just it's a
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
shift um and I'm not sure if that's
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
considered a limited limited fiscal
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
impact it's not a limited shift in the
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
impact um so imagine Manchester versus
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
Marlo right we have some issues of scale
 
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.430 align:start position:0%
Marlo right we have some issues of scale
with

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
this um does the tax credit get divided
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
between two tax bills if you're a two
 
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
tax bill Community we do do that right
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't state that that's the
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
case um in other statutes it's stated
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
that um in no way shall the combination
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
of uh exemptions and credits turn into a
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
situation where the community is paying
 
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
the person right so not only is there no
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
zero Bill they're actually going to get
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
check from the municipality that
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
language is not in here um there are
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
other statutes so you can pull that
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
language in if you want to uh choose to
 
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
amend this and um to wrap up um I know
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
in 2010 and this is my written testimony
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 1489 was a proposal to
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
adopt a volunteer incentive property tax
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
credit um that was found itl by the
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
committee back then uh and the house was
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote itl as well I'm not saying
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
passes prologue um but this committee
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
legislature has looked at this issue
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
before um and then subsequent to that
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
there was a bill dealing with uh
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters and having them
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
work some kind of tax credit in um and
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't that didn't pass muster
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
either that's the gist of my questions
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you for your testimony
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
so that was the um one and only
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
additional pink card beyond the um Prime
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor so I will ask is there anyone
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
present who wishes to speak to this bill
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
that has not yet had the opportunity to
 
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.790 align:start position:0%
that has not yet had the opportunity to
do

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
so seeing none I will close the public
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
hearing on House
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
to indicate representative Gilman to
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
report out the blue
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
sheets but you can do that
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
now thank you madam chair in today's
 
00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
blue sheet the uh one uh representation
 
00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:29.230 align:start position:0%
blue sheet the uh one uh representation
is

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
neutral the online testimony is three in
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
okay we're we're doing well on our
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
schedule so at this time I will open the
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 766 enabling
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt an exemption
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
from the local education property tax
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
residents the chair recognizes
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
good morning members and again thank you
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak before you
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
on Hospital
 
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
766 the reason for this uh bill that I
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
bring to the table uh is the goal of
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
providing an environment
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
of allowing our aggressively mature
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
population otherwise known as elderly to
 
00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:28.599 align:start position:0%
stay in their homes uh I'm also a
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
professional realtor and I've uh this is
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
my 12th term at the state house and what
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
I've learned over time is in planning
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
for a reality future in uh in the
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
context of identifying the need and then
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
providing Avenues of opportunity uh
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
increase the quality of life and
 
00:37:52.589 --> 00:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
relative to uh this bill we have U found
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
that our uh Elders that uh have
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
committed to their towns for decades and
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
would like to stay in their town and I
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
would like to they choose to but
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately when the economics play a
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
role uh a higher authority ends up
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
influencing what the decisions are uh
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
they end up leaving the leaving town and
 
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
and many times leaving the state and uh
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
as we all are aware as representatives
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Senators the housing challenge we
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
have in our state is uh front and center
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
from the governor on on to us as well
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
and it's the meeting meeting that
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
challenge is what I bring to the table
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
for your consideration here uh
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
specifically this is the uh this is a
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
goal the goal here is to provide an
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
Avenue by option of the cities and towns
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
who know their population best to uh
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
reduce the obligation in this case of
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
the school property tax which is the
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
biggest impact on our tax bill for for
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
our elders who have and PR a bill uh as
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
the states a qualification is those who
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
are 70 years in of age and older have
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
lived in their residence for 30 years
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
and also a criteria is have uh no more
 
00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:16.589 align:start position:0%
and also a criteria is have uh no more
than

00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:39:20.109 --> 00:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
$750,000 in saved assets and now saved
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
meaning a savings and um as other bills
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
that you may have seen in the past uh
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
their vehicle would play a role in in
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
the asset base as
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
well the uh key becomes is paying paying
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
their bills um inflation that we're
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with and uh in other tax
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
tax effects uh has made it a challenge
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
for our elders to stay in stay in their
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
homes and the choices of where to go uh
 
00:39:48.589 --> 00:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
is uh in many of our smaller towns is
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
not to promote
 
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.390 align:start position:0%
not to promote
um

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
overdevelopment you know and
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
overdevelopment that's been the concept
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
and building infrastructure know four
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
apartments and that's it's not been it's
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
been a challenge and especially in also
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
in where I live I live in Windham New
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I grew up in Salem and unless
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
you have an infrastructure in place uh
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
for uh water and sewer you do not find
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
competitive low rent opportunities uh
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's just that's just the cost of doing
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
business for our housing so so again
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
this opportunity here is when town are
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
looking to find ways of um maintaining
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
costs and uh also is not to have U
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
population uh growth based on an exodus
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
from the towns when uh other other costs
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the town can U make being affordable
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
for a for elders to stay in town uh the
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity here is to give a uh the
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
school um a batement for those who would
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
qualify that the town did would
 
00:40:59.710 --> 00:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
determine by their own census and that's
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
a census of those what they've owned in
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
town and and meeting the criteria that
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
has been specified and the longer they
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
live in town then we have a slower
 
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
change of ownership and by slower that's
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
my assumption looking at what's happened
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
in towns that I've done research on as a
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
realtor uh is that they stay in their
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
homes for longer and that when they're
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
sold when families move in and with and
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
bring and we want families to come to
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but in in an uh a gradient
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
method of not overpopulation uh that our
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
cost of education is substantial per
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
student this would delay that and and
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
delay it or for a period of time where
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
it becomes slower in in the growth
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
mantra for our respective cities and
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
towns and and to keep these folks in the
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
towns that they love that they've
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
supported and uh one of the points of
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
the 30 years was just using 12 years for
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
if uh when they had their own kids in
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
and they've been contributing to the
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
cost and of sustaining and maintaining
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
our school districts uh the again the
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
biggest majority of our tax bill is for
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
our schools is that this will allow them
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
to stay in in the town and not um being
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
part of what's the other challenge we're
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
looking at right now not right now have
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
been is um nursing home assisted living
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
and capacity in our counties and with
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
those costs that differential cost still
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
comes into our tax uh calculations is I
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
offer that this strategy is one for the
 
00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
for towns and cities to opt in if the
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
demographic makes sense for them and
 
00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
hope and I'm suggesting that it does and
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
that we keep people in their homes
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
longer and for that reason I ask for
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
your uh your consideration for this
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you madam chair thank
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
you for the bill introduction questions
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:01.559 align:start position:0%
Walker for a
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
question how is this proposal exactly
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
Fair because I had a constituent that
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
asked a similar thing and I asked him do
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
you have any kids when you were younger
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
he goes yeah I have three kids and I go
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
hm there was an elderly person at that
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
time that paid for your three your three
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
kids to go to school but now that when
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
you're elderly you don't want to pay pay
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
into your share what somebody else did
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
and now how is that
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
fair it's the cost of doing something
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
versus doing nothing representative
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
Walker the the issue becomes and uh and
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
I'm just going on my back on what I've
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
learned here in the legislature is the
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
cost of being in a nursing home which we
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
cover in our taxes or or other costs
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
when they when our citizens don't remain
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
in their homes uh is is substantially
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
higher and I don't have the have the
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
cost of demographic the present to you
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
today on that but that that's I by the
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
way I agree with what you're what you're
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
talking about I want a fair and and
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
applicable obligation for all of us and
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is that's not
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter and the reason is
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of Education being our biggest
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
expense even for our smaller towns in
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire when they
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
have Cooperative school districts our
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
elders are there's many of the elders
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
that I've spoken with and that's where
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
this comes from uh cannot afford to stay
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
in their homes any longer
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's why for this consideration
 
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
it's not it's to have a more orderly
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
growth replacement than having an exodus
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
that's what people leaving that people
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
our fellow citizens leave leaving the
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
state because they cannot stay here any
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
longer and or with their families as
 
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839 align:start position:0%
well and so this is one that can they
 
00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
stay in their homes longer and help
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
facilitate that by main uh maintaining
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
their costs on their own but with this
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh tax abatement for on the school side
 
00:44:59.069 --> 00:44:59.079 align:start position:0%
only I still would cover the the
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
property tax for for the town you know
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
County and Etc but um on the school side
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's why it was focused on the school
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
only that they did support for 30
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
years and that's where the number comes
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
from thank you the chair recognizes
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative majority for a question
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm originally
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
from New York my father when he was
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
alive uh uh there's a program down there
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
called the program and he was able to
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
have $7,000 of his tax taxes deferred um
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
because of that program so I'm wondering
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
and certainly that was a benefit to him
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you have modeled this
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
legislation after any other state like
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
New York which has the star
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
program thank you for the question um
 
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.430 align:start position:0%
program thank you for the question um
your

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
honor rep
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative I was want to address
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
everyone formally um the uh the answer
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
is no I did not um what I've learned is
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
what I've learned in New Hampshire I've
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
grown up here and uh learned from my
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues where I want to assimilate uh
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
in an intelligencia that allows for
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
rational recommendations to meet the
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
future challenges we have in state so I
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
did it's called the Stark program star
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
star excuse me I I'm apologize but no I
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
did not utilize that thank you further
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.829 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
representative

00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
Guri thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative I
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
like to talk talk a little bit about the
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
30-year limit you have and I understand
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to do as far as keep
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
people in their homes but would this be
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if it's not fair but it
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be better if we required in
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation that the people live in
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
the town uh my my concern you know and
 
00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:03.079 align:start position:0%
we're neighbors I'm from Hamstead and
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking of myself
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
and uh I
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
downsized uh and I moved into a a uh a
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
park with the uh instead of instead of a
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
regular house but I stayed in the same
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
town so I would qualify for being in the
 
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
town for 30 years but I didn't live in
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
the same house for that 30 years is is
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
it would it be uh would would this have
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
been uh fairer if we had said that the
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
person should be in the living in the
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
town for 30 years because that's where
 
00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
the tax was being
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
paid well that's a debating Point
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative and the issue uh right
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
here is that you you already chose to
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
move I me again the goal here is to keep
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
people in their homes so it didn't open
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
up the home for New frankly for new
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
families to move in with with their
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
children and then to expand the costs in
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
the other in the education uh Silo um
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
but if that's something that you wanted
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
to that the board would consider then
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
for an amendment on this I mean that's
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's why we talk collaboratively to
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
achieve consensus on what would be what
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
would work if something like that would
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
be improved but the target of this bill
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
was to keep people in their homes and
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
with then have the sold their home if
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
maybe I hope you you got a good sale on
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
your home that you had the that asset
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
then becomes an income stream for you
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
and then you can lower your fixed and
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
variable cost of living then you you've
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
met that challenge it's there are those
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
who don't or can't do that or to would
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
ra would rather is there a way of
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
staying in their home and and also one
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
other point is one thing we do very
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
substantially in the state is home
 
00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:52.839 align:start position:0%
Community Based care and that's again to
 
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
maintain folks in their home with you
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
know with Health visits and you know
 
00:48:59.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
doctor visits and so on as as opposed to
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
being transferred elsewhere elsewhere
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
meaning that again nursing home or
 
00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:05.799 align:start position:0%
hospital setting so that's what just
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
incenter his Force for for this criteria
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
unless you would recommend a an
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and that's I look to the uh
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
committee on that subject I understand
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to attempt thank you
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
very much for taking my question yes sir
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you thank
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
grund and then representative
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chairwoman and
 
00:49:33.789 --> 00:49:33.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so is
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
there is there a way to I want to say
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
prevent or how do we account for if the
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
elderly person's kids who has grandkids
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
that go to the school are living in that
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
house now they're not paying any taxes
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
to the school even though they have
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
children in the school is there any
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
limitation for that that would be that's
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
why this is an option for the town and
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
the town can also make addition rules
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
for this again it's it's not to to uh
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
circumvent an obligation if the if
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's a specific use of that residence
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
in this case education to have the kids
 
00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:11.079 align:start position:0%
living in so I mean that that's not what
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
targeting may I have a quick followup
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so how would a town know
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
that a family is living there and not
 
00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
and they have kids in the school but
 
00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
they're not paying taxes because the
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
elderly I mean they can't they're not
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
taking an assessment of who's living in
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
a household well I'll just speak on my
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
behalf I'm a past 12E selectman in my
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
town of wiam and when uh we were doing
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
but like for just for services and
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
support and also education you had to
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
always say where did you live in town
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
and you would and have to qualify that
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're an actual resident and then it
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
would be collaborated and Co cerated in
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
working together to ensure that yeah so
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
again because folks have we're looking
 
00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.150 align:start position:0%
again because folks have we're looking
at

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm aggressively mature myself
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
here but the uh back when we first got
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
started there were those moving from out
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
of state and we uh were using the
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
education resource and this was like
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
maybe five that took place this is like
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
25 years ago and um that was identified
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
when a census was being taken and where
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
individuals live so a similar scenario
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
would would be the case when you're
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
having a a benefit of this of this and
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
that's a people in their to keep people
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
in their homes of people when I say
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
people the owners whove lived their 30
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
years in their
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
homes thank you the chair recognizes
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan for a question
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
question as I look at this I see that
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying we're trying to save or
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
help the elderly uh with their tax bill
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
um but I I'm assuming that that tax bill
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
that the elderly won't be paying is
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
going to have to be picked up by others
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
in the community uh and I wonder if
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
there is there a potential un unintended
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
consequence here of in in in the context
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the housing crisis that the state is
 
00:52:17.549 --> 00:52:17.559 align:start position:0%
is uh seeing are we shifting this tax
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
burden to the younger people in the
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
community that already are struggling to
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
pay their their taxes and is that an
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence that that you
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
consider uh yes that was and um as as
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
one who's looked at U not looked at has
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
worked hard and not always successful at
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
having a balanced tax base established
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
in a respective Town based on uh on
 
00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
future planning of what's coming in your
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
town in this case like in the town of
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
wiam when we used to go to uh to S to
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
for schooling to Salem OR to and then to
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
pinkin uh we we had our own School
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
District coming in that's been the
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
biggest impact in the town of wiam and
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
what the town and this is where the town
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
chooses what to do is their policy still
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
was not to allow Economic Development to
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
take place to meet the additional costs
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
and and we have zoning that does not
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
allow over overdevelopment either so
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
this is a town responsibility on
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
determining what's the best thing for
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
our the respective Town Council or
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
selectman to determine to do and cost
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
wise savings would be approximately
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
$9,000 and when you're looking at uh
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
from our tax rate it's in what the Imp
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
would be and I don't have the exact
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
number um but the impact would be in the
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
sents as in pennies you know for that
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
difference in in a revenue stream being
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
made up and we're not and and we have in
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
our town and we have have a fellow U
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
gentleman that have worked together on
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
this bill as a constituent who's going
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
to speak a little bit to this is that uh
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
it just in in dealing with how many
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
Elders that would qualify for this it's
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
a very small it's a small demographic
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
graic uh I was trying to get it to OS
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't have it to all towns I mean
 
00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
I have all the tax assessments but
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't get that population uh but
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
that's where it comes to the respective
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
town has the the determination to see if
 
00:54:14.109 --> 00:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
this makes sense in keeping th their
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
citizens in town and also a way of
 
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
controlling the the biggest uh cost
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
impact on growth is is when more
 
00:54:23.630 --> 00:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
families move
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
in thank you for the answer um I would
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
just remind anybody that's going to
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
speak don't repeat the same answer to
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
different questions because we've
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
already heard that information and we we
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
do have additional speakers so the chair
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
now recognizes repres representative
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
Colby for a
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and I
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
might be able to uh help you
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative a little bit um in
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
Windam uh we have age 65 and over you
 
00:54:58.119 --> 00:54:59.910 align:start position:0%
Windam uh we have age 65 and over you
have

00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
2542 residents as of 2022 the most
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
recent I have here in
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
2024 65 plus uh elderly
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
exemptions uh were $12
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
million I'm how do you anticipate that
 
00:55:17.599 --> 00:55:20.109 align:start position:0%
million I'm how do you anticipate that
number

00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
growing well
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
I I I didn't get that information there
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
but uh what I've done in
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh here was dealing with those again who
 
00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
were 70 and older and been in in their
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
homes for 30 years and that's where that
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
demographic is has quite a dramatic
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
impact on the what that real number and
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
the number that my associate came up Mr
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
Morris who speak shortly uh was
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 140 and one thing that we
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
didn't get down and I was uh I wanted to
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
be fully loaded intellectually for you
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
but I would could not get this down was
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
how many was seasonal so you know so
 
00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
fulltime and then in Windham we have
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
know carets Pond and so on but was not
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
in so many other of our towns where um
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
properties that are owned by our elders
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
but they're not their primary residents
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
and uh so that 140 plus did not account
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
for how many are seasonal but that's
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
where that research comes in dealing
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
with our the with how that's interpreted
 
00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
on uh U by by the cities and town so
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
this isn't a circumvent or to force a a
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
a mandate from the state onto our cities
 
00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:31.039 align:start position:0%
and towns it's here's an opportunity and
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
a framework for performance that to help
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
for the reasons already
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
stated but thank you for that
 
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.109 align:start position:0%
stated but thank you for that
representative

00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:40.910 align:start position:0%
representative
kby

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
kby
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
followup thank you madam Sher um just
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
lost my train of thought but uh if you
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
would like this might help you out I can
 
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
pass that down um don't we already as
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't they already have
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
an option um to adopt an elderly
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
exemption um and could they within those
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
elderly exemptions
 
00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
modify uh to make things more uh
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
palatable or affordable uh for people in
 
00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.349 align:start position:0%
palatable or affordable uh for people in
their

00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
communities there there are and by the
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
way wiam has has one as well but it does
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
uh what it is it it goes to uh reducing
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
the total of the assessment which in in
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
wham's case and our average is $900,000
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
a home um is
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
$200,000 that does not I mean does not
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
have a material and uh impact on
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
providing fund enough funds now this is
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
in my view which is why the bill enough
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
funds for these Elders to again to pay
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
to pay the the their cost of living and
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
one of the um ISS issues on that in the
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
qualification is that you can't be over
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
$300,000 in assets and this is in nwn of
 
00:57:59.549 --> 00:57:59.559 align:start position:0%
Windham and that just went up literally
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
this past uh well within the last 12
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
months we don't have people qualifying
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
for that you know and and so now when
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
I'm and the reason the 750 came I I was
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
reaching out to other time when I see
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
reaching out doing the research and uh I
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
we got that recommendation um after
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
reviewing it from Brookline and uh from
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
like similar find like similar towns and
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
that wanted again to maintain their
 
00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
citizens who supported their town to
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
stay in their homes and controlling
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
growth as a result but hope that answers
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
your question thank you ma'am
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you madam
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
chairwoman uh I think section six
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
answers my question but I just want to
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
be sure it it talks about the the owner
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the property we have a couple of
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
bills in housing that deal with adus
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units am I is it safe
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
to say that if the owner of the
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
property qualifies say one year Builds
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
an Adu and moves into that Adu and say
 
00:59:02.109 --> 00:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
their kids move into the main residence
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
that the ex like this would then
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
disqualify them because they have moved
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
into the Adu and that's not their actual
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
residence that would be my sense okay
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
all right yeah I appreciate the Technic
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
that the very specific Adu issues both
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
attached and detached as you know we had
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
on bills coming right uh not coming but
 
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
voted on but you're right sir no that
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
would not be okay qualification thank
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
you further questions I have a quick
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
question you had mentioned in your bill
 
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
introduction that you said the ton will
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
will vet recipients I may have missed it
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
but would a resident need to apply and
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
qualify and the the point that I'm
 
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
making is is is this automatic or does
 
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
would the recipient actually need to
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
fill out an application and and show
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
some sort of proof that they fulfill the
 
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications uh
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
your yes it it's an application function
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
and uh for review and compliance by the
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
authorities having jurisdiction in the
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
town and specifically the assessor I
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
would say the the
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
assessor in filing this bill did you
 
01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
consult with Dr uh yes matter of
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
fact uh a number of entities I don't
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
have the notes in front of me here honor
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
did um further
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chair I just
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up on the um the
 
01:00:47.029 --> 01:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
question about family that lives in a
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
house and has children that are going to
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
school but the house name is in the
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
30-year resident um would
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
there's a would there be
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
a discussion between the town's assessor
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
schools uh attendance records that will
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
assessor asking a question that would
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
add a burden to an assessor that's to
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
with all respect that's not a burden
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's what the assessors are supposed
 
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:23.039 align:start position:0%
to do and and I would say that that's no
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
not a burden but it would be a a
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
question of ownership and
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
occupation U I mean uh who's
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
occupying the uh the property and that
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be what the uh bard of selectman
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the Town City Town Council would
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
ensure would be the rules for those who
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
would qualify for uh for this ex this
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
exemption have a followup Madam shair
 
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
quickly yes um so if I understand
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
correctly the select board would set
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
rules that say uh if a child uh
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
grandchild is permanently res resident
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
of that property then uh this no this
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
does not qualify to the person
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
applying I would say the at this point
 
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
outside of a revision on some wording
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
that that's the intent of this it's not
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
the circumvent or U taxation that's
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
appropriately obligated again this is a
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
housing issue to keep our elders in
 
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.710 align:start position:0%
housing issue to keep our elders in
their

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
homes yes
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
ma'am further questions seeing none
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair thank
 
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
you committee at this time the chair
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
Misha welcome back good morning Madam
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
chair and committee members thank you
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify for the
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jim misho Chief
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
assessor for the town of Hudson what I
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
said prior holds My Views don't
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily represent the views of the
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
board of selectman for Hudson they have
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
not registered an opinion on this bill
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
um speaking to the administrative
 
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill um it's looking for
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
communities uh to be able to adopt an
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
exemption from the local T education
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
tax but we don't know what the local
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
education tax is each is each year until
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
we issue the bill so how do we Grant an
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
exemption on an unknown number
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
we can't and that's why um the bill as
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
written just doesn't work it will not
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
work procedurally
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
administratively um this is not uncommon
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
with some of the bills that come in
 
01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
front of you not just this year but in
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
Prior years we have to understand how
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
the tax administration how the tax bill
 
01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
process works we have to know what our
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
total vet credits are we have to know
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
what our total leld exemptions are our
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
total disabled exemptions because all of
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
those get loaded into the tax rate
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
calculation process that dep that the
 
01:03:57.870 --> 01:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue um administers
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
each year um that's the gist of my
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
testimony um but beyond that um in
 
01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
reviewing the bill it's not clear if the
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
exemption is in addition to any prior
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions that apply to the bill you
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
know we already have an existing elderly
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
exemption program does this pig pile on
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
top of that I don't know um I assume it
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
does um beyond that the asset amount of
 
01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
$750,000 there's only one community in
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
the state that has an elderly exemption
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
program existing um that has an asset
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
$750,000 that that's a pretty high asset
 
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
limit um there's no income limit for
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
those that are applying for this so um
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
asset tested but not means tested as far
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
as income as far as the range of elderly
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
exemption asset amounts it ranges from
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
the Dom Minimus 35,000 up to what I said
 
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.190 align:start position:0%
the Dom Minimus 35,000 up to what I said
the

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:50.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
750,000 uh the median asset limit is
 
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:56.119 align:start position:0%
63,000 the average asset limit is 9
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
1,600 this is all from nhdra online 2023
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
tax year um I believe that the varying
 
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
amounts of assets probably reflect that
 
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
there's different socioeconomic uh areas
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
in the state right Pittsburgh might be
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
different than Portsmouth permont might
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
be different than pelum um
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
so beyond that I have no other comments
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
and I'm available for
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%

01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
Wier as
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
attempts to allow senior citizens who
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
have made a
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
commitment for over 30 years or more um
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
to their Community to stay in their
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
homes I'm going to change glasses here
 
01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
yeah there we
 
01:06:35.549 --> 01:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
go um just as a in
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
2023 uh the average age of a firsttime
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
home buyer in New Hampshire was 35 years
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
old uh in 20 2024 that age has increased
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
to 38 years uh with this in mind when
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
one looks at at the parameters set in
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
766 the current new homeowners will have
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
paid school
 
01:06:59.710 --> 01:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
taxes for the next 32
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
years uh in order to take advantage of
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
this elderly exemption while also
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
needing as you know to meet the asset
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
limit set out in in this
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill as firsttime home buyers in
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
1980 little could my wife and I imagine
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
we would be paying school taxes for the
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
next 45
 
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:23.799 align:start position:0%
years we have no issue with paying it
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
forward for well-educated
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
children but with retirement the meaning
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
of being on a fixed income has hit with
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
a new real had hit has hit hit us with a
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
new reality um House Bill 766 I believe
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
addresses the ongoing needs of an aging
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
population that still require Municipal
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
services such as police fire and EMS
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps even more than when younger um
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
as you know Municipal and state tax will
 
01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
not be exempt from
 
01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
payment overall the exemptions allowed
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
in House Bill
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
766 I believe helps stabilize a
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
community's tax base by keeping elderly
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
in their homes whereas if they need to
 
01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.110 align:start position:0%
in their homes whereas if they need to
abandon

01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
abandon
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
them because of the inability to keep up
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
with an ever increasing tax
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
burden new families with children on new
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
first home home to
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
firsttime home buyers planning families
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
in the future would replace them this
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
adds to the schools this adds to the
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
school tax
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
impact anecdotally the above scenario
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
was exactly what happened to my wife and
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
I over the 45 years we have been
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%

01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%

01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
elderly neighbors we now see families
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%

01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%

01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
certified and in the past 11 years now
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
we have driven over 1.7 million miles
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
our Volunteers in carrying people to
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
their medical
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
appointments House Bill 625 was written
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
as an enabling legislation to reduce
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
numbers the burden rather of those
 
01:15:29.709 --> 01:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
cities and towns with a large share of
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit agencies such as Plymouth
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
according to the New Hampshire division
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
of Revenue administration's report 2023
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
comparison of full value tax rates
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
Plymouth is R ranked seventh out of 228
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities listed and seventh from
 
01:15:47.159 --> 01:15:48.189 align:start position:0%
municipalities listed and seventh from
the

01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
bottom um this is primarily because 53%
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
of plymouth's taxable property is owned
 
01:15:57.430 --> 01:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
by non non- tax paying
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofits uh leaving all the cost of
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
the Town Services being paid for by the
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
remaining 47% of the property
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
owners regardless all the residents all
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
the businesses all the nonprofits
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
receive every benefit that is provided
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
by the town of Plymouth and is funded by
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
the town of Plymouth
 
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers at Plymouth Town Meeting last
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
March I was asked to create a bill that
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
would um seek uh payments in Le of taxes
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
from plymouth's nonprofits that would
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
lessen the property
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
um you know the property tax impact that
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
Plymouth property owners are feeling
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
House Bill 625 is the a bill that
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
accomplished that and after some
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
investigating we found that other uh
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
cities and towns might also be affected
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
and and are we've had conversation with
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
town of Kean they have 22% of their um
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know 20% 22% of their
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
properties are nonprofit owned conquered
 
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
has 23 Anover has 35 and Berlin has
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
43 so this bill is enabling legislation
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
which means that the municipality must
 
01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
decide to enact it or ignore it and if a
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
town wishes to adopt it the town shall
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
pass an ordinance by or bylaw to provide
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
an agreement between the municipality
 
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit the nonprofit profit May
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
provide for exemptions from the payment
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
and they can do this by um articulating
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
U Regional or local benefit and also
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
they may be able to describe their
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
financials aren't adequate to pay the
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
25% so that's up to the town to consider
 
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
and after consideration of the
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
exemptions the municipality may decide
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
to enact it and the nonprofit shall make
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
payments in lie of Taxation on all real
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
and personal property owned by the
 
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
organization in the city or town equal
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
to 25% of the municipal rate of the
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
property tax that would be paid if the
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
property were not exempt from
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
Taxation and I probably don't have to
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
explain but the municipal rate um of the
 
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
property tax is simply the the monies
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
that go toward support of the town it's
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
not um including education and County
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
taxes so 25% of that that
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
number um regardless I urge the
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee's passage of HP 625 and I'd be
 
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions thank you
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%

provide just shy of $24 million in free
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
or reduced cost services to our clients
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
to tax us on top of what we already
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
generously contribute to the many
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
communities in which we're an integral
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
part would force us to either cut
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
services in particular towns or begin to
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
charge or to raise fees this would be
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
akin to instituting a regressive tax
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
where the ones who need our services the
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
most are the same ones who would be most
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
severely affected I strongly oppose the
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
passage of HB
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%

01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
municipality so uh often when uh there
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
might be federal dollars flowing through
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
a particular quasi public agency um that
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
aren't timely uh we might get referrals
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
to help with rent assistance for example
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
or heating assistance or food assistance
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
um that happens on a number of occasions
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
um we've often seen in in City welfare
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
departments where um they're running at
 
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
a surplus and they should be payer of a
 
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
first Resort and they're referring to us
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
first before um there is any uh help
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
administered at the town or city

01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
program was established in 1969 as a
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
501c3 we challenge and help at risk New
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire boys to believe in themselves
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
work well with others and find their
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
best since 1969 we have helped 2,400
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
boys in the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
our family profile has an average in
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
come of about $29,000 a
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
year our boys mostly come from single
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
parent homes and what we do is we have
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
an eight-year program where they come to
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
Mayu during the summer and then during
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
the winter our Outreach workers meet
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
with each child at least once a month to
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're on track and we
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
reinforce the values that we're teaching
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
at Mayu we're the only program of its
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
type in the state of of New Hampshire
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
and one of two in the nation that works
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
the way that we
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
do we are against the passage of 8B of
 
01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:04.950 align:start position:0%
do we are against the passage of 8B of
HB

01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
625 Mayu owns 39 acres of land that has
 
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:11.639 align:start position:0%
been assessed at
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
5,465 th000 which transfers into a tax
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
liability of approximately
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
129,000 at
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
25% that would be a
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
$32,000 liability
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
operations 81% of all of our funding
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
goes to program and our boys the
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
remainder goes to
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
operations if we had a tax bill of
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
$322,000 it's likely that we would need
 
01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
to eliminate 42 boys from the program
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
currently we have
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
220 and that's because we would either
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
curtail one of our camp sessions or we
 
01:24:56.109 --> 01:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
would have to um uh eliminate an FTE one
 
01:24:58.350 --> 01:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
of our employees because that represents
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
about 70% of one FTE in our
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
organization Mayu is one of the many
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that work hand inand with
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
state agencies to provide support on a
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
weekly basis we're in conversations with
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
DCF dhss and
 
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
doe HB 625 would hamper our ability to
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
provide services to our board
 
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.229 align:start position:0%
provide services to our board

the record uh my name is Kathleen raren
 
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
I'm the CEO of the N Hampshire Center
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
for nonprofits which is a nonprofit
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
organization that exists to strengthen
 
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
and give voice to New Hampshire's
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
nonprofits we have more than 800 members
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
and represent their interests here we
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
have strong concerns about HB 625 and
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
the implications that it will have on
 
01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit ability to serve our
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
communities as you consider the
 
01:26:18.669 --> 01:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
legislation I would ask you to think
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
about a few things one is the important
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
significant role that nonprofits play in
 
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
our communities here in New Hampshire we
 
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
rely on nonprofits heavily for a diverse
 
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
array of services Services which in some
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
other states are performed by government
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are strong partners with
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
government providing services such as
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
those you've heard about today
 
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
affordable housing homelessness uh
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
Services Health Care Mental Health our
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder prevention and
 
01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
more they are also drivers of our
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
economic Vitality um providing
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
stewarding our natural resources
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
providing cultural resources as well
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
they are a part of why New Hampshire is
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
such a great place for all of us to live
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
and and for people to visit as well in
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
addition most of New Hampshire's
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofits are quite
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
small according to IRS data um 70% of
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
our 501c3 have revenues or budgets under
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
$100,000 this kind of tax would be
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
devastating and may even bankrupt them
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
and as you've heard today even those
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
larger organizations it would have a
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
significant impact on their ability to
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
to perform their
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
services most nonprofits receive a lot
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
of their funding through funding through
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
restricted mechanisms and so they are
 
01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
not able to Simply absorb these kinds of
 
01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.830 align:start position:0%
not able to Simply absorb these kinds of
cost

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
burdens finally I would add that our
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
statute already allows for Pilots
 
01:27:57.109 --> 01:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
um and it is a local issue that
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities can negotiate in good
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
faith for voluntary payment in Lee of
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
taxes from nonprofits which is a bit of
 
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
a compromise because the reason that
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofits in the public policy decision
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
has been made for for nonprofits to be
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
exempt is in recognition of the
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
significant services that we provide to
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
the community so in closing I would just
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote this in expedient to
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
legislate um and I'm happy answer any
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
you the chair calls Mr Brody Dees

testimony this morning um for the record
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
my name is Brody Dees I represent the N
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association we are a
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit that uh represents
 
01:28:54.109 --> 01:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
um every municipality voluntarily in the
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire they're voluntary
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
members and they've chose to be members
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking in support and
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
representing our position on um House
 
01:29:01.679 --> 01:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
representing our position on um House
Bill

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
625 um our position is that this is a
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
local option it's the option of the
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
voters to allow 25% of the tax bills for
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofits to um to be paid um I want to
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
really point out that um that there's
 
01:29:19.709 --> 01:29:19.719 align:start position:0%
there are Provisions in this current
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill that would allow the governing body
 
01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
um Not only would they be required to
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
adopt an ordinance ordinance or bylaw
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
but it would allow them to still fully
 
01:29:31.109 --> 01:29:31.119 align:start position:0%
exempt um nonprofits and charitable
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
organizations from paying taxes it just
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
allows a local option for the voters to
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
say Yes um the default is a 25% pilot
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
payment in Le of taxes and then the um
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
requirement of the governing body
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
typically the board of Selectmen it
 
01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
could be a board of assessors though if
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
that happens if it is adopted in a
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
community to um to essentially um exempt
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
them fully still so this would create a
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
more local option and would allow for
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
governing bodies to really evaluate
 
01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not a nonprofit or tradable
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
organization is um serving and bettering
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the public good in their
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
Community improving the public welfare
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
which municipalities have a duty to do
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I respect all the nonprofits that are
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
coming in front of you today in the
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
services that they provide um that said
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
at the same exact time we can only as
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities raise revenues through
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
property taxes and when we have member
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
communities where nearly 55% of their
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
assessed land is exempt from taxation um
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
that creates a a quite a um quite a
 
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
burden shift onto the other property
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and yes um it is it was
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier and we couldn't agree
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
more that there's 7 RSA 7223 DN allows
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
for voluntary payment in lie of taxes so
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
it allows a voluntary system for these
 
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
organizations to to to pay um taxes to
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
the municipality but in some cases there
 
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
are times where governing bodies have
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
really questioned the charitable or the
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofit status of organizations and um
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
while they might be considered such by
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
the IRS um the municipality's question
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not their mission is
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
furthering some kind of public benefit
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
where they're completely exempt from all
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
taxes so we view this as a very modest
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
local control option um I think our One
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
technical thing that we'll point out is
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
that um it would be nice if in
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
establishing this new section of State
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
RSA that there's some kind of citation
 
01:31:24.590 --> 01:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
that doesn't um it doesn't
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
um overrule um any existing um voluntary
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
payments and L of taxes under RSA 72
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
colon 23 DN or that it's explicitly
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
stated that that can still happen so you
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
could go both routes right if a
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit want to pay more than 25% of
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
of a pilot um of its total what is its
 
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
assessed property tax um then it could
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
um if they wanted to pay less that could
 
01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
be negotiated so allowing for this uh
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
this the these proposed statutes to not
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
overrule the existing 7223 DN so you
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
have kind of two local options so um
 
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
that would be our one recommendation and
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
I will um take any questions from the
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee if there are
 
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
any that was perfectly timed thank three
 
01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
minutes on the DOT questions for Mr Dees
 
01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair um do you
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
feel that this could possibly encourage
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
um being optional um and then still
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
allowing uh negotiations to happen do
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
you think it would encourage like
 
01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.950 align:start position:0%
you think it would encourage like
cherry-picking

01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
organizations um I hear I hear that fear
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
um I would have some faith that our
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
governing bodies in the state would not
 
01:32:44.669 --> 01:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
be playing favoritism and they would
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
probably run into lawsuits if they were
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
starting to do Viewpoint bias for who
 
01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
they provide um property tax exemptions
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
to I think if they had a clear criteria
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
in a ordinance or a bylaw of how are
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
they going to determine this if if the
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
voters so if the voters in a
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
municipality or a city were to adopt um
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this law and it were
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
to require the governing body who
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
oversees the assessing of taxes whether
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
it's a board of assessors a board of
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
Selectmen or some other governing body
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
prescribed by state law um if they were
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
to go through that entire process um I
 
01:33:20.669 --> 01:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
would imagine that they would adopt a
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
bylaw and ordinance that has a strict
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
and um a a strict and clear criteria for
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
what the qualifications are as to one
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
not to put burdens onto organizations
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
that are very clear compelling public
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
benefit to the municipalities or you
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
know maybe an entire region um but to
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
also recognize when there might be other
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that they exist and you know
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
they benefit maybe their membership but
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
there might not be a compelling public
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
interest for why they should be fully
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
exempt from taxes and in many ways this
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
will force organizations to the table to
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
say okay maybe we should help um pay for
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
some of the municipal services that are
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
being provided in this community because
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
everyone benefits from those services
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
that the municipality provides so this
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
is just looking for a creative way to
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
say there should be more negotiations of
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
Pilots it shouldn't be just on the
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers and those who are
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
living in mostly residences um to pay
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
for all the municipal services that
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
every organization and individual
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
benefits from so our stance would be
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
that this is um this is a way to allow
 
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
more more local control and discretion
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
of who should be paying I guess the best
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
way to put it for lack of better term
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
share the chair recognizes
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you madam
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and thank you for taking my
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
question uh did I understand you
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
correctly that RSA 7223
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
n allows a municipality to do
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
essentially what this bill is doing it
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
allows but it doesn't have any
 
01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that the um the charitable
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
or the nonprofit organization actually
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
do it so I I'll read the exact statute
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
to you it's 72 col 23- voluntary
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
payments in Li of taxes quote the
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
governing body of any municipality may
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
enter into negotiations for a voluntary
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
payment in Li of taxes we often call
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
that pilot from otherwise fully or
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
partially tax exempt properties and may
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
accept from such properties a voluntary
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
repayment in Le of taxes so they can but
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing where there's a criteria
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the local governing body to
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
essentially kind of you know say is the
 
01:35:30.510 --> 01:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
is there a compelling reason as to why
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
this organization is fully tax exempt or
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense for them to
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
contribute some to the tax base for the
 
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
services that they utilize um within the
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
municipality so there is an option for
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
the organization the town to negotiate
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
something but the organization decides
 
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have any interest um in
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
negotiating it doesn't matter what kind
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
of services or what the um the purpose
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
is of the charitable or nonprofit
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
organization they can just say no we're
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
not contributing because we qualify
 
01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
under existing state statutes as an
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
exempt nonprofit under 72 Co and 23 at
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
least they properties that qualify under
 
01:36:04.719 --> 01:36:05.870 align:start position:0%
least they properties that qualify under
that

01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
statute additional questions
 
01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.750 align:start position:0%
statute additional questions
representative

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
grundt thank you madam chairwoman thank
 
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um trying to
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
just clarify all the different groups
 
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
that might fall under this provision so
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
looking at so we we've heard from a
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
couple not not for profits but this when
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at chapter
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
292 which goes into volunteer
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
corporations associations which is
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
referenced in the bill it starts talking
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
about literary scientific institutions
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
libraries promotion of Education Arts
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
Sciences hospitals homes for asan for
 
01:36:43.679 --> 01:36:45.390 align:start position:0%
Sciences hospitals homes for asan for
invalids

01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
invalids
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
Freemasons uh grounds other conveniences
 
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
for bar
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
so are we talking about all of these
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
organizations they do provide
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
he you know Town Services these would
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
all be potentially subjected to this 25%
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
of the municipal rate if they qual I
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
mean my reading of the bill and let me
 
01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.470 align:start position:0%
mean my reading of the bill and let me
make

01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
sure let me open up the bill
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
here yeah that would be U my reading of
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
the bill is yes they would be um 25% of
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
the municipal just Municipal tax rate
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's worth pointing out too so not
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
swept not school just Municipal tax rate
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't even include a v Village tax if
 
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
they're in a village area where they
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
benefit from Services I will say however
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's part of the purpose for the bylaw
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
and the ordinance requirement so they
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
may adopt a byw and ordinance and say
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
clearly you know a private library
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
because there are libraries in the state
 
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
that are publicly governed but they are
 
01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
private property um with their own
 
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
private trust that you might say well
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
it's not worth taxing that library
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
because of it's very compelling public
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
interest to provide literature and free
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
access to information in a municipality
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
you could have an example though of um a
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that exists for some examples
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
might be like a nursing home that you
 
01:38:01.589 --> 01:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
know there's been numerous um lawsuits
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
and rulings by the uh the the btla um
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
regarding you know the nonprofit status
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
and the you know the commercial
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
operations of some nonprofits that
 
01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
provide a service and um whether or not
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
they should be tax Exempted in some ways
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
this would allow a local municipality to
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
say well there's clearly a lot of
 
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:20.679 align:start position:0%
commercial aspects to your nonprofit and
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
the charitable um services that you're
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
providing so would you be willing um
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
because of how large your infrastructure
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
is and you know how many people live
 
01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:29.639 align:start position:0%
maybe at your physical plant uh to
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
provide some revenues to the property
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
tax space um in many of those
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
organizations they do Mr Dees your your
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
answer is going on and on I appreciate
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
your knowledge and your detail but try
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
to make it more concise because a lot of
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%

01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative Elward thank
 
01:39:04.109 --> 01:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
you Madame chairman Mr duche thank you
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um on line
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
15 um Roman
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
2 any city or town that adopts this
 
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
section shall adopt an ordinance or
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
how does the town adopt this section and
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't the legislative body adopt or
 
01:39:32.639 --> 01:39:34.790 align:start position:0%
doesn't the legislative body adopt or
pass

01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
ordinances um it depends on the
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
ordinance so often time boards are
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
select and will adopt ordinances to
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
govern the entire uh community in this
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
case it's a um the legislative body is
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
voting to require its governing body to
 
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
adopt the ordinance or bylaw I would
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
agree that it would be better suited for
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
the bill to um to cite what governing
 
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
body um which is why you know I guess I
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
kind of left it out my initial testimony
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
but I meant to include it as to mention
 
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
that it's Boards of Selectmen or Boards
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
of assessors that would kind of oversee
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
um what what uh what kind of um how
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
they're assessing taxes in the community
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
and who's allowed to have exemptions or
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
um approval of like a um an appeal of an
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
abatement and things of that nature so
 
01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
um I think it would serve the bill
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
better if the committee were to move
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
forward and recommend a to pass to
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that section but the intent of
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
that section is for whoever the
 
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
governing body is that oversees that
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
process to adopt a bylaw and ordinance
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
for how this would operate in their
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
municipality thank you further questions
 
01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.149 align:start position:0%
municipality thank you further questions
representative

01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question if there is a
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
court case that already established that
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit needs to pay for part of
 
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
what they do and and in this case it's
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
an educational institution that needs to
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
part pay taxes for any part that is not
 
01:41:01.149 --> 01:41:01.159 align:start position:0%
aimed at
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
education would this as an enabling uh
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
Bill and
 
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
um Al also a um select board making a
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
regulatory or or
 
01:41:20.109 --> 01:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
um what's the word I want um bylaw Etc
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
would would the bylaws and regul from
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
the select board override that court
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
case so if I'm understanding your
 
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
question correctly and please correct me
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong um land or property that is
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
not being used for the charitable or the
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
nonprofit use that has to be based on
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 72 colon 23 which we'll have a
 
01:41:45.149 --> 01:41:45.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on House Bill 147 I think
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
after this hearing or maybe two hearings
 
01:41:50.109 --> 01:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
from now that land has to be assessed
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
and taxed because it's not being used
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
for a charitable or nonprofit profit to
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
my understanding the way we read the
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
bill is that this is land that's
 
01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
currently under and being used by the
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
charitable or the nonprofit for its
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
stated use and this would if a local
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
governing body were to adopt the
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
provisions of this law require the
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
municipality to adopt bylaws and
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
ordinances to negotiate a 25% pilot for
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
those other lands that are covered under
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
the charitable or nonprofit use okay
 
01:42:18.639 --> 01:42:20.229 align:start position:0%
the charitable or nonprofit use okay
thank

01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
the point that I wanted to make uh
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's relevant here is the narrowness
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
of the of the margins that organizations
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
like ours operate on so our sources of
 
01:44:32.589 --> 01:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
income are the rent that our individuals
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
pay they're all under 30% Ami in other
 
01:44:37.629 --> 01:44:37.639 align:start position:0%
words they're very low income they rely
 
01:44:37.639 --> 01:44:38.510 align:start position:0%
words they're very low income they rely
on

01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
SSI uh so we're getting rent payments
 
01:44:45.149 --> 01:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
based on their SSI benefit we receive
 
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
funding from Medicaid to pay for the
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
services hour for hour that we provide
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
and then to cover the balance we fund
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
raise which is approximately 12% of our
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
operational spending so for
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
organizations like ours to impose uh
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
taxes in addition to um those that we're
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
already paying um is potentially
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
existential issue you know it's reduce
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
Services close or fundrais to uh ask
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
people to help us pay our taxes um in
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
terms of negotiating
 
01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:24.229 align:start position:0%
terms of negotiating
with

01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities small organizations like
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
ours you know I happen to be a lawyer we
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
so we have a lawyer but we're in the
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
minority we certainly don't have
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
lobbyists and so you know we're we're
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
not we're the weak ones when it comes to
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
if we're put in a position of having to
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
negotiate for our survival thank you
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
I'll take any
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%

43,000 jobs in New Hampshire uh and we
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
just believe that decisions about
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
whether a community and a nonprofit
 
01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:53.719 align:start position:0%
hospital or other should enter into
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
pilot or local decisions and ones that
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
will be determined based on the local
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
community needs um decision makers and
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%

to speak to you on opposition of House
Bill

Bill
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
625 this bill if passed would have a
 
01:52:48.510 --> 01:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
significant consequence to this on the
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
steps the state has taken to expand
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
affordable and Workforce housing
 
01:52:55.229 --> 01:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
the front door agency's transformational
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
housing program offers affordable
 
01:52:58.390 --> 01:52:58.400 align:start position:0%

Services to single mothers with young

Continuum of Care and become
 
01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:05.719 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining members of our community
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
to do this we own four properties and
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
charge rental rates of less than $450 a
 
01:53:13.069 --> 01:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
month so that our moms can create
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
stability for their families and attend
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%

achieving sustainable Independence
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
we currently take a loss on these
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
programs and fundraise accordingly
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
because we know that through our 36
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
years of History this program works in
 
01:53:34.109 --> 01:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
addition we have a portfolio of three
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
properties offering permanent support of
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
affordable housing to those most
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
vulnerable providing 48 total units
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
rents charged are between $800 and
 
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
$1,100 a month for Studios to three
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
bedrooms and we offer Supportive
 
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
Services to the families residing there
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
as well with the average rental rate in
 
01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
in NASA exceeding $2,300 for a
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom leving a property tax on
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofits offering the service would
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
only reduce the affordable housing
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
inventory in our
 
01:54:06.109 --> 01:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
state in the last 6 months alone our
 
01:54:07.709 --> 01:54:07.719 align:start position:0%
agency through our housing stability
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
program saw a
 
01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
233% increase in the number of requests
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
for rental and utility
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
assistance the front door agency is a
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
business and we oppose this bill because
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
it represents an unfair tax on our
 
01:54:23.870 --> 01:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
industry severe consequences for
 
01:54:26.910 --> 01:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state we fill a
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
gap that government does not at a time
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
where nonprofits are facing severe
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
challenges with higher demand potential
 
01:54:37.069 --> 01:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
Cuts in federal funding this is not a
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
time to add an additional burden and
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
which will affect those we serve who
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%

demonstration of the changes in bold and
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
strikeout that house bill 147 proceeds
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
to accomplish so at this point I'm going
 
01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%

is a clarifying bill that provides an
 
01:58:51.239 --> 01:58:52.750 align:start position:0%
is a clarifying bill that provides an
explicit

01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
definition for the word
 
01:58:57.870 --> 01:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
appertaining it has been brought to my
 
01:59:01.069 --> 01:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
attention that the term appertaining can
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
and has been interpreted in various ways
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to determining lots and
 
01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
buildings used for religious educational
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
and charitable purposes house spell 147
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
gives it a firm definition in fact just
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
as a a brief exercise eyes I Googled
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
quickly on a dictionary appertain the
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
word and it two definitions immediately
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
came up just as a demonstration of how
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
vague this term is and how easily it
 
01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:37.639 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted in various ways the
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
first definition is quote relate to or
 
01:59:46.589 --> 01:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
concern and the second definition is
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
quote be appropriate or
 
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
applicable so as you can see uh as a
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
standard there's a lot of room there for
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation House Bill 147 will make
 
01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:00.669 align:start position:0%
interpretation House Bill 147 will make
it

02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:00.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:00:03.950 --> 02:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
clear House Bill 147 amends the sections
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
that refer to appertaining and instead
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
uses phrases such as quote on the same
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
lot which is on the bill page one line
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
22 and quote the entire building and lot
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
on which religious or in the instance of
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
Education are charitable activities are
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking place shall be exempt from
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
taxation under this section and that can
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
be found throughout the changes uh you
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
can look at House Bill 147 page 1 lines
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
25 to
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
27 and again uh you know OSS
 
02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they do a fantastic job
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately with this bill they
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
did not clearly highlight the changes
 
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
that would occur to current law in
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
section RSA
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
7273 so again I point out to you on the
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
back of my testimony you'll note that
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
only three
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
sections in RSA
 
02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:13.719 align:start position:0%
7223 are amended and I very carefully
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
took it upon myself to make those
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
changes in bold and strike out on the
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
back of my testimony so you can see
 
02:01:24.910 --> 02:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
on these are important sections of Law
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it is critical that they be clear in
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
verbiage for the religious educational
 
02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
and charitable organizations that use
 
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:38.679 align:start position:0%
them I ask that you recommend ought to
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 147 and I thank you
 
02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
for your attention to this matter and
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
always for your service thank you madam
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Mooney
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman is
 
02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
question uh I should have asked this
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
actually on the last bill but I'm going
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
to ask you too uh because of the um
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
definition change how does this apply to
 
02:02:10.109 --> 02:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
museums and their
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
properties they're not educational or
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
they don't they're not
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
defined thank you for that question um
 
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's a good one I would say that
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
this bill and this section of law is
 
02:02:30.669 --> 02:02:30.679 align:start position:0%
relevant to religious educational and
 
02:02:30.679 --> 02:02:31.950 align:start position:0%
relevant to religious educational and
charitable

02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
organizations so whether or not a
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
specific Museum would be classified as
 
02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps educational or charitable in
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
that instance this would apply to them
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
but without that
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
classification uh I'm not sure what it
 
02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
would be classified as but that's my
 
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
best take on your question sure
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative majori
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
and I certainly appreciate clarifying
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
language to clear things up which goes
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
to my question in line
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
25 for the purposes for the purposes for
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
which they were established couldn't
 
02:03:13.159 --> 02:03:14.229 align:start position:0%
which they were established couldn't
that

02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
also be ambiguous or or or or or
 
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
interpreted in different ways so then
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
the second part of that is could that
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
eliminated thank you for that question
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh I would start out by saying that's
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
current law that you quoted and my bill
 
02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh intends to clarify and flesh out so
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
thus the next sentence is the clarifying
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
Factor there whether or not those words
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
are necessary any longer um I don't know
 
02:03:50.669 --> 02:03:50.679 align:start position:0%
I don't have an opinion on that at this
 
02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
point because my focus was adding the
 
02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:54.629 align:start position:0%
point because my focus was adding the
next

02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
sentence um and also my focus was to
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
keep the law intact as much as possible
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
with adding clarifying
 
02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
words sure additional
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
you the chair will call Father trainer

Manchester I come before you today uh to
 
02:04:52.589 --> 02:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
support House Bill uh 147 in my time in
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
Ministry I've seen how our churches
 
02:04:56.549 --> 02:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
operate on the front lines offering food
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
and financial and other assistance uh
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
most vulner to the most vulnerable in
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire communities our
 
02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
pastors collaborate with local officials
 
02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
and others in the community to meet the
 
02:05:08.669 --> 02:05:08.679 align:start position:0%
most basic human needs from feeding the
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
hungry clothing the naked and providing
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
shelter and care for the homeless and
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
while our local day-to-day interactions
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
are largely collaborative we have
 
02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
experienced challenges in a number of
 
02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities consistent with the
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
description found in the purpose in
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
findings of House Bill 147 I'm here just
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
to speak to one example in our Parish
 
02:05:29.709 --> 02:05:29.719 align:start position:0%
where the wooded area of our Cemetery
 
02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
that is preserved for the future use of
 
02:05:34.510 --> 02:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
the cemetery has been subject to
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
taxation uh you'll find additional
 
02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
examples experienced throughout the
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
dases in the written to testimony I will
 
02:05:42.910 --> 02:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
present uh as well as information about
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
the time and expenses this has uh had on
 
02:05:48.549 --> 02:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
our our communities the Catholic church
 
02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
has and will continue to serve
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
individuals in need because we are deci
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
deciples of Jesus Christ but the
 
02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
ambiguity of the existing law is posing
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
challenges to our ability to continue to
 
02:06:00.910 --> 02:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
serve at the current level and a
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
decrease in the level of contribution
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
and services by houses of worship and
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
other organizations impacted by the
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in the current law undoubtedly
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
would increase pressure on local and
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
state governments to make up the Gap it
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
also causes the risk of uncertainty for
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
small organizations and locations such
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
as our Parish in sunuk uh for these
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
reasons we respectfully urge the
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%

documents requests from municipalities
 
02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
in the last two years have been
 
02:07:53.910 --> 02:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
extensive and specifically related to
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
the issues addressed in House Bill 147
 
02:07:58.589 --> 02:07:58.599 align:start position:0%

need because we are Disciples of Jesus

Christ but the ambiguity of the existing
 
02:08:36.669 --> 02:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
law is posing challenges to our ability
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
to continue to serve at the current
 
02:08:40.350 --> 02:08:40.360 align:start position:0%

by the ambiguity of the current law
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly would increase pressure on

local and state governments to make up

the ambiguity in current law causes
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
expenses and uncertainty for those who
 
02:09:06.109 --> 02:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
are exempt as well as for
 
02:09:08.669 --> 02:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities for these we reasons we
 
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge the committee to
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%

02:09:30.430 --> 02:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
have been okay
 
02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
so questions for the
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%

02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
again thank you madam chair and

committee members uh my name is Jim
 
02:10:01.629 --> 02:10:01.639 align:start position:0%
misho Chief assessor for the town of
 
02:10:04.549 --> 02:10:04.559 align:start position:0%
Hudson uh my comments here are intended
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
to be neither Pro nor con they really
 
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
talk about technical aspects of the bill
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
and my comments don't necessarily
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
reflect the views of the Hudson Board of
 
02:10:13.549 --> 02:10:13.559 align:start position:0%
Selectmen they have not voted on a
 
02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
position on this
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
bill uh much of the handout that I've
 
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
given you talk uh about nine pages or so
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
goes back and looks at the prior
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
legislative history of this
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
statute the general court in this
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
session has 10 plus bills that deal with
 
02:10:33.069 --> 02:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
this statute many of them are today in
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
front of this committee there's one in
 
02:10:36.910 --> 02:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
front of I don't know why house Ways and
 
02:10:38.910 --> 02:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
Means and there's a two that we know of
 
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
at least in the Senate so there's a lot
 
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
of activity on this uh statutory area um
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
the arrival of these bills is primarily
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
Arisen due to a lot of expected reaction
 
02:10:51.350 --> 02:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
from institutional stakeholders this
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
reaction is primarily based upon
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
municipality's legal compliance with
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
existing laws and
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
rules said compliance efforts directly
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
attributable to the board of tax and
 
02:11:04.589 --> 02:11:04.599 align:start position:0%
land appeals btla decisions over the
 
02:11:06.629 --> 02:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
last two to three years New Hampshire
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision as well as stated
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
direction from the assessing Standards
 
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
Board as well as that from the
 
02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
Dr the gamut of the bill proposals bring
 
02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
us back some 30 years to go when the
 
02:11:20.669 --> 02:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
last significant changes to RSA 72 colon
 
02:11:23.790 --> 02:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
23 rose from a very well represented
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
study commission that worked in
 
02:11:28.990 --> 02:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
reconciling the then language of R
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
7223 the bill language some in House
 
02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 147 actually represents a return to
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
how the language was at least in
 
02:11:39.629 --> 02:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
material ways back some 30 years ago as
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
the bill history shows us the changes
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
from 30 years ago were intended to and I
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
quote from the house Journal close
 
02:11:50.350 --> 02:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
loopholes and protect against abuse and
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
they were made after two-year effort
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
again from an Institutional tax
 
02:11:56.350 --> 02:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
exemption study
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
committee the chapter law from 30 years
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
ago specifically brought into the law
 
02:12:04.510 --> 02:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
the very words that this bill 1147 W
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
stricken quote and the lands are
 
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
pertaining to them owned used and
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
occupied directly so folks that were
 
02:12:15.109 --> 02:12:15.119 align:start position:0%
here in these seats some three decades
 
02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
ago spent two years and ended up adding
 
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
in regards to House Bill 147 itself the
 
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
bill states in the purpose and findings
 
02:12:29.470 --> 02:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
that the word directly is not used in
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
the utilized in the charitable portion
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
of RSA
 
02:12:35.549 --> 02:12:35.559 align:start position:0%
72235 that's not an accurate reading of
 
02:12:37.229 --> 02:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
the current law all of the
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
non-governmental owned property
 
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
educational religious charitable all use
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
the words directly in their
 
02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
context I've attached a blended version
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
to my testimony of the current
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
applicable provisions of the RSA so one
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
can see where the changed language is
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
where it's stricken and where the
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
language is
 
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
added the bill language does present
 
02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
some possible problematic scenarios so
 
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
an otherwise qualifying charitable
 
02:13:06.030 --> 02:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
entity buys the ball of the Mall of New
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uses some of it for
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
charitable purpose they according to the
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
tenants of this bill they could then
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
qualify for the rest of the building as
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
being exempt now that's obviously a
 
02:13:19.390 --> 02:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
ridiculous example but if it can happen
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
because of the language then it could
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
happen further the Bill's language
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
brings up some contradictions you can't
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
have statutory language that reads own
 
02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
used by owned used used and occupied as
 
02:13:35.069 --> 02:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
criteria and then exempt the whole
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
building as if it's not applicable this
 
02:13:40.030 --> 02:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill raises more questions than it does
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
solve neire New Hampshire municipalities
 
02:13:44.030 --> 02:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
have numerous buildings that have a
 
02:13:45.629 --> 02:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
terrible entity owning the entire
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
building and lot and they have split up
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
spaces some is used for charitable some
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
used for commercial commercial and they
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
pay a proportionate share in property
 
02:13:56.830 --> 02:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
taxes for the non-exempt
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
use if the cited number of examples did
 
02:14:02.430 --> 02:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
occur exactly as written and a
 
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
municipality's governing body is not
 
02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
applying the laws correctly there
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
already exists multiple Avenues in
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
statute to address this alleged Arata
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
btla Superior Court the AG's office the
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
Dr can launch an inquiry Etc what we
 
02:14:19.709 --> 02:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to do is dramatically change
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
the reference laws because there are
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
some possible harms existing in a
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
veritable ocean of compliance with the
 
02:14:28.390 --> 02:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
Law's requirements by nominally tax
 
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
exempt entities and government officials
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
alike there are those that believe that
 
02:14:35.069 --> 02:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of harm to all affected
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders can that can take years and
 
02:14:39.790 --> 02:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
dollars to fix can come from making rash
 
02:14:42.390 --> 02:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
and abrupt changes to RSA
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
7223 and its related contingent laws as
 
02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
is proposed in the 10 plus bills cited
 
02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:51.559 align:start position:0%
so far for this legislative session this
 
02:14:53.310 --> 02:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
might just be the time as it was 30
 
02:14:55.229 --> 02:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
years ago for both the House and Senate

02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%

02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
resolution to these issues thank
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you questions for Mr

you the chair recognizes Miss Gretchen
 
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
Gretchen Wade followed by Mr Brody Dees
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
government can you hear me okay okay
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
there we go um I would like to piggyback
 
02:15:34.589 --> 02:15:34.599 align:start position:0%
off of what the prior speaker just said
 
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
um that there's been three decades that
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
have passed since this uh was last
 
02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
researched and unfortunately there have
 
02:15:44.109 --> 02:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
been three decades of litigation on
 
02:15:46.109 --> 02:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
figuring out what exactly this ambiguous
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
statute is meant to say um my colleague
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
here attorney Michael Tierney is now in
 
02:15:52.109 --> 02:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
the room will be able to provide more
 
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
further information on those specific
 
02:15:56.830 --> 02:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
cases however I'm here to address and
 
02:15:58.549 --> 02:15:58.559 align:start position:0%
support this bill because unfortunately
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
this language is not only ambiguous for
 
02:16:02.549 --> 02:16:02.559 align:start position:0%
the individual property owner but is
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
also ambiguous for the town um and
 
02:16:06.669 --> 02:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not the town has decided to
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
initiate litigation or the individual
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
who has the tax assessed against them
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise it is a cost um so whether or
 
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
not as another prior speaker had
 
02:16:19.069 --> 02:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned unburied person's area of a
 
02:16:21.549 --> 02:16:21.559 align:start position:0%
cemetery is taxed differently
 
02:16:23.390 --> 02:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
um where obviously individuals have not
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
died but then will eventually be buried
 
02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
um but the town then also has unburied
 
02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:30.559 align:start position:0%
persons area in their cemetery and are
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
not taxed on that um so looking through
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
the entire statute of 7223
 
02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities charitable organizations
 
02:16:40.990 --> 02:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
educational organizations and religious
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
organizations all have to go through a
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
little bit of a different test and this
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
bill would put everyone on the same
 
02:16:49.629 --> 02:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
playing field so whether or not the town
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
has a cemetery where there are unburied
 
02:16:53.469 --> 02:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
persons where there's open ground for
 
02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
future individuals and a religious
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
organization that has a cemetery where
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
there is ground where there are unburied
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
individuals this would put them on the
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
same playing field um so to the extent
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
that the committee has any questions I
 
02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
would ask you to support this Bill thank
 
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
you the chair calls Mr bro Dees followed
 
02:17:23.429 --> 02:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
miles thank you to the committee and um
 
02:17:28.270 --> 02:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
my name for the record is Brody desesa
 
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
represent an Amire Municipal Association
 
02:17:32.030 --> 02:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief because uh most of most of
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
the points that I were going to make
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
were made by Mr misho of Hudson um I do
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
just want to flag um I do want to flag
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
two things one is um a concern in
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill um the last
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
sentence uh lines 25 26 and 27 um where
 
02:17:52.469 --> 02:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
it states the entire building and laot
 
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
on which religious activities are taking
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
place shall be exempt from taxation
 
02:17:58.349 --> 02:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
under this section um we find it that
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
some of our accessors it'll be kind of
 
02:18:01.709 --> 02:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
confusing because if you have a building
 
02:18:04.270 --> 02:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
and you have a wedding there for example
 
02:18:06.270 --> 02:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
um that's a religious activity and does
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden do wedding venues be
 
02:18:10.509 --> 02:18:10.519 align:start position:0%
considered um could they apply if they
 
02:18:12.190 --> 02:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
were especially if they were a nonprofit
 
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
could would their entire you know maybe
 
02:18:15.150 --> 02:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
some of the commercial aspects of what
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing would that be tax exempt
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
so that was one thing where we found
 
02:18:19.549 --> 02:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
that could be ambiguous and there
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
obviously are nonprofit or for example
 
02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
churches where they do wedding
 
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
ceremonies and we understand why they're
 
02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
tax ex them because they're religious
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
organization but we found that that
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
could add some additional ambiguity for
 
02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
when and when when and when not a um
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
organization that's hosting a religious
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
activity whether or not they tax exempt
 
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
um another thing that we really want to
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
flag is um by allowing all the property
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
that um the you know the nonprofit has a
 
02:18:50.309 --> 02:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
has a um buildings or they're utilizing
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
for their specific charitable or
 
02:18:54.509 --> 02:18:54.519 align:start position:0%
nonprofit use um by allowing the entire
 
02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
lot to be included you could
 
02:18:58.429 --> 02:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
theoretically have you know a church
 
02:19:00.349 --> 02:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
might only have its church and its
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
parking lot and the things you know they
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
where they do different activities for
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
religious activities or not just a
 
02:19:07.309 --> 02:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
church but any house of worship on only
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
an acre but they may own up to 25 acres
 
02:19:13.469 --> 02:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
and um as long as the areas of the lot
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
that aren't being used for any religious
 
02:19:19.389 --> 02:19:19.399 align:start position:0%
or charitable or um nonprofit usage that
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
is subject to taxation Our concern is in
 
02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
some instances and in some
 
02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities you would see a massive
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
burden shift from these organizations
 
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
that are paying taxes on land that they
 
02:19:30.589 --> 02:19:30.599 align:start position:0%
own that aren't being used at all for
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
any charitable nonprofit or religious
 
02:19:36.830 --> 02:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
use and instead um that land would all
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
of a sudden become exempt and you would
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
be shifting it to all the other property
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and um in the municipality so
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
any other business Commercial
 
02:19:48.509 --> 02:19:48.519 align:start position:0%
institution or uh residential homeowners
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
so that's our biggest concern with the
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
bill is that could see in many instances
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
um a tax burden shift for land that
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
isn't being actively used by the
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofit charitable organization or
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
house of worship religious organization
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
for any of their stated purpose um of
 
02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
their organization and fulfilling their
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
mission their goals or religious
 
02:20:11.469 --> 02:20:11.479 align:start position:0%
Doctrine and Creed and so with that I'll
 
02:20:13.469 --> 02:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
yield to any questions but I think Mr
 
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
Misha's testimony was pretty
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and helping uh point out
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
some of the larger assessing
 
02:20:21.190 --> 02:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
issues thank thank you for your
 
02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:22.710 align:start position:0%
issues thank thank you for your
testimony

02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thanks thank
 
02:20:28.990 --> 02:20:29.000 align:start position:0%

represent the town of marac I am a
 
02:20:45.150 --> 02:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this bill and I'm here
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
today to voice my support for House Bill
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
147 uh because it is matter M of
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
fairness Clarity and good governance for
 
02:20:57.309 --> 02:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities too often towns are left
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
dealing uh dealing with unclear or un
 
02:21:01.830 --> 02:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistent policies that create
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
confusion unnecessary disputes and
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
financial strain this bill helps ensure
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
that local governments are not put in a
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
position where they have to guess at how
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
certain properties should be taxed or
 
02:21:16.110 --> 02:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
face legal battles over unclear
 
02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
exemptions it provides much needed
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
consistency and predictability with
 
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what M municipalities
 
02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
and their residents need without this
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
bill we could see towns caught in costly
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
legal challenges local organ
 
02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
organizations facing unexpected tax
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
burdens and communities losing out on
 
02:21:37.590 --> 02:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
services that these organizations
 
02:21:40.349 --> 02:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
provide uncertainty and tax policy can
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
divide communities and strain
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
relationships between municipalities and
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
the people they serve House Bill 147 the
 
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
goal is about keeping things fair and
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
clear for everyone involved it ensures
 
02:21:55.389 --> 02:21:55.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities can focus on governing
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
not litigating and that organizations
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
doing important work in our communities
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
are treated consistently I urge the
 
02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee to support House Bill 147 and
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
help us avoid unnecessary conflicts
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
hurting both towns and
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thank
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%

just a clarification so we heard earlier
 
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
that there was a concern about gambling
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations being part of a
 
02:22:36.030 --> 02:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
building that's much larger than itself
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
can you comment as to how you feel that
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
fits into this bill I think simple
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment with a clarifying statement
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%

02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
welcome to Municipal and County
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank thank you thank you for having me
 
02:23:20.510 --> 02:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
Michael Cherney I am an attorney in
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester I've represented uh dozens of
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
entities both Municipal entities as well
 
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
as religious entities as well as
 
02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
charitable entities as well as
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
educational entities all four different
 
02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
categories in different cases over the
 
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
years and while this statute hasn't
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
changed in 30 years the way in which it
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
has been interpreted has changed in the
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
last 2 years you have an increase of
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
assessors who are looking and trying to
 
02:23:49.269 --> 02:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
find Little Bits that they can say are
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
not being used for for religious or
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
educational purposes and if you look at
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
the statute the charitable tax exemption
 
02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
currently doesn't have the language of a
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
pertinent there to if anyone can tell me
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
what the limits of a pertinent there to
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
is I would love to hear it um there's no
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
case law that has determined what a
 
02:24:14.990 --> 02:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
pertinent there to is um but it has been
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
used by some towns and some assessors
 
02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
but not others okay in order to try to
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
find that there's some lands um that
 
02:24:25.389 --> 02:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
should be taxable and not tax exempt
 
02:24:27.389 --> 02:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
what type of lands am I talking about
 
02:24:29.349 --> 02:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
well I'm thinking about one particular
 
02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
school that's run by a religious order
 
02:24:33.630 --> 02:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
okay so they're entitled to a religious
 
02:24:36.670 --> 02:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
tax exemption and they have about 30
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
acres and a 50 foot wide um parcel of
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
woods around the outside of their school
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
a a wooded buffer um and the town after
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
for 25 years I think giving them a
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
complete tax exemption okay has now
 
02:24:55.110 --> 02:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
determined that that wooded
 
02:24:58.030 --> 02:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
buffer is not pertinent there to the
 
02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
school buildings therefore it is a
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
taxable property that's not just one
 
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
town we have dozens of towns all across
 
02:25:07.349 --> 02:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
the state okay who are looking at
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
Aerials are making those determinations
 
02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
and frankly it wastes a lot of time on
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of the towns as well as on behalf
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
of the churches and the educational
 
02:25:18.030 --> 02:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
institutions to be saying oh hold on a
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
second it's not a 50ft wide buffer it's
 
02:25:23.309 --> 02:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
a 60ft wide buffer or you know this
 
02:25:26.110 --> 02:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
particular year it's a 55 foot buffer
 
02:25:29.150 --> 02:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
and the next year it's a 45t buffer
 
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about you know a large
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
number of dollars here um the case I'm
 
02:25:36.750 --> 02:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
talking about is about a $400 tax bill
 
02:25:38.830 --> 02:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
for that 50 foot wide buffer it's not
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
going to break the bank um but it is
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
going to be fair to treat that religious
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
run School the same as any charitable
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
entity you don't see in the charitable
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
part that pertinent there too you don't
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
see for the public school that pertinent
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
there too so regardless of the point of
 
02:25:59.230 --> 02:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
the tax exemption okay let's just make
 
02:26:02.269 --> 02:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
them all the same make them all equal
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay so that they can be fairly and
 
02:26:04.319 --> 02:26:07.190 align:start position:0%
okay so that they can be fairly and
equally

02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:10.349 --> 02:26:10.359 align:start position:0%
applied I have written testimony I'd be
 
02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
happy to pass it around um I've done
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
these cases um on all four sides um and
 
02:26:18.510 --> 02:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
so I've seen it from all different
 
02:26:20.030 --> 02:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
angles I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
has questions for attorney Tierney the
 
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative majority
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam
 
02:26:32.670 --> 02:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and thank you for taking my
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
question which will be a repeat that I
 
02:26:35.870 --> 02:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
that I asked the prime sponsor I'm just
 
02:26:38.110 --> 02:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
really curious about the language for
 
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose which they were
 
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
established um and again not having the
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
Bold I I think the prime sponsor said
 
02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's existing language but I'm just
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if that then is
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
left to interpretation and maybe we
 
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
should if we're trying to tighten the
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
bolts down on this if maybe that we
 
02:26:58.550 --> 02:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
should consider striking that language
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
what do you think in your experience so
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's existing language it's existing
 
02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
language that I haven't really seen as a
 
02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
a particular issue when you have an
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
entity that is exempt that rents out to
 
02:27:14.590 --> 02:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
a for profit entity okay that is
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
something that for a religious or
 
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
educational entity makes that property
 
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
tax uh taxable it's taxable property but
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
for a charitable entity you can still
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
hold on to your tax exemption as long as
 
02:27:30.349 --> 02:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
that charitable entity is using the rent
 
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
from the for-profit rent for its
 
02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:35.150 align:start position:0%
from the for-profit rent for its
charitable

02:27:35.150 --> 02:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:37.870 --> 02:27:37.880 align:start position:0%

02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Health and Social Services that our
 
02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
Citizens need want and deserve
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
nonprofits fill the void which our local
 
02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
M municipalities and the state cannot
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
provide for I'm not going to name all
 
02:30:37.630 --> 02:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
the nonprofits that serve our
 
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
communities and state I'm sure after
 
02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
sitting here for the past couple of
 
02:30:42.590 --> 02:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
hours you've got a good idea of the
 
02:30:45.030 --> 02:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
number local nonprofits help make our
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
community Stronger by the participation
 
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
of hundreds of volunteers the volunteers
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
experience Fellowship companionship
 
02:30:53.830 --> 02:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
social interaction and the most
 
02:30:55.630 --> 02:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
important feelings of contributing to a
 
02:30:58.710 --> 02:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
goal and the accomplishments of the
 
02:31:00.990 --> 02:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit last session I introduced a
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
bill that would allow the board of
 
02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
Selectmen to ensure that they could
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
accept late filings from nonprofits
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
based on accident mistake or Misfortune
 
02:31:11.309 --> 02:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
this bill was passed by the New
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house senate and eventually
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
signed into law by the governor with an
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
effective date of April of
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
2025 and that's for reference that's RSA
 
02:31:24.110 --> 02:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
72 colon 23
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
V1 prior to the passing of that bill I
 
02:31:28.910 --> 02:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
was unaware of any accepted reason a
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
nonprofit give to PR prevent the late
 
02:31:34.269 --> 02:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
filing P penalty causing the nonprofit
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
to pay their full tax bill for example
 
02:31:39.550 --> 02:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
prior to this uh legislation being
 
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
passed a nonprofit would go to a post
 
02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
office put it in the mail on say on
 
02:31:46.670 --> 02:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or Thursday asked for one day
 
02:31:50.349 --> 02:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
delivery on say around May 29th uh the
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
mail goes out it's on a weekend so now
 
02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
the town doesn't go to the mailbox until
 
02:31:58.670 --> 02:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
June 2nd they open up the letter and it
 
02:32:01.630 --> 02:32:01.640 align:start position:0%
could be stamped June 2nd so effectively
 
02:32:04.790 --> 02:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's late and they have to pay the taxes
 
02:32:06.990 --> 02:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
the uh they have no opportunity to come
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
in and say hey look at I've got my
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
receipt here for one day delivery it
 
02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
went to the mailbox and they didn't pick
 
02:32:18.389 --> 02:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
Monday uh this this bill should be
 
02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
considered a bridge for nonprofits who
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
were required to file before June 1st
 
02:32:27.070 --> 02:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
2024 and April
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
filing this bill will allow nonprofits
 
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to justify the lateness
 
02:32:39.510 --> 02:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
being due to accident mistake and
 
02:32:41.710 --> 02:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
Misfortune before the elected Board of
 
02:32:43.710 --> 02:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
Selectmen to ask for an adjustment on
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
the property taxes and if denied they
 
02:32:48.429 --> 02:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
may then appeal to the superior court or
 
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Land and taxes
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
I hope you view this spill as a common
 
02:32:54.030 --> 02:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
sense and reasonable and will allow our
 
02:32:55.870 --> 02:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofits not to be hurt and give them
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to appear before their
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
board explain where the taxes uh the
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
proper paperwork was late thank

my
 
02:33:18.429 --> 02:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
question um in line five it cites
 
02:33:22.349 --> 02:33:22.359 align:start position:0%
accident mistake or Misfortune as a good
 
02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:24.290 align:start position:0%
cause for
 
02:33:24.290 --> 02:33:26.150 align:start position:0%
cause for
[Music]

02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:33:29.790 --> 02:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
um not filing on time could you tell me
 
02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
that in your hypothetical male situation
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
would that be an accident mistake or
 
02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:38.550 align:start position:0%
would that be an accident mistake or
Misfortune

02:33:38.550 --> 02:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
Misfortune
 
02:33:41.309 --> 02:33:41.319 align:start position:0%
situation I would go with The
 
02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
Misfortune uh I know I've got Christmas
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
cards that are stamped December 18th and
 
02:33:49.389 --> 02:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
I've got them December 30th in the mail
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
so don't have a lot of faith in the male
 
02:33:52.830 --> 02:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
service thank
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
you further
 
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Walker root
 
02:34:00.590 --> 02:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
cause of the original
 
02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
problem Mike microphone the root cause
 
02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the original problem isn't that
 
02:34:08.510 --> 02:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
multiple years between their filings
 
02:34:10.349 --> 02:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a it's not
 
02:34:14.110 --> 02:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
a yearly filing for this right it's it's
 
02:34:15.910 --> 02:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
basically kind of confusing because they
 
02:34:18.670 --> 02:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
have to file one set of paperwork on the
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
in April and then another set of
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
paperwork in the June and some people
 
02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know due to whatever uh didn't get
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
filed in in June and I think there was a
 
02:34:33.429 --> 02:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
supremor court case uh that said there's
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
no reason that it can be late in the law
 
02:34:38.670 --> 02:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why I put in this accident
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
Misfortune uh part of the law itself
 
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah additional
 
02:34:48.030 --> 02:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:34:52.429 --> 02:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
France thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:34:58.269 --> 02:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
um is there a particular time limit for
 
02:35:00.750 --> 02:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
the forms to be late I mean like what if
 
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
they're like six months late or
 
02:35:04.590 --> 02:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
something like that that would be
 
02:35:06.510 --> 02:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
something that the board of selectman
 
02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
would have to address whether there was
 
02:35:10.510 --> 02:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
no reason for them to be late then they
 
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
could be you know taken off the
 
02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofit list as far as taxes go all
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does is
 
02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:20.120 align:start position:0%
just brings back the date of from April
 
02:35:24.870 --> 02:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
of 2025 back to when June 1st of 2024
 
02:35:27.710 --> 02:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
those groups in between that may be late
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
and that'll be a call by the board of
 
02:35:31.389 --> 02:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and if they're not happy with
 
02:35:33.469 --> 02:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
that they can appeal to Superior Court
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
or the Bureau of Land
 
02:35:40.269 --> 02:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
question further questions seeing none
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%

02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
June 24 filing was late due to a serious
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
family medical issue experienced by the
 
02:37:04.030 --> 02:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
staff person responsible for that filing
 
02:37:06.190 --> 02:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
and was exacerbated by an illness of one
 
02:37:07.510 --> 02:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the seasonal workers and that person
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
was covering the front desk for
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
admissions in addition to doing
 
02:37:12.110 --> 02:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
everything else they were doing as it
 
02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
has for several years the filing only
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
contained a listing of board members
 
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
since our final financial statements
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
were not available by the due date we
 
02:37:21.870 --> 02:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
file an extension for our tax return and
 
02:37:23.389 --> 02:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
each year and the financials were
 
02:37:24.910 --> 02:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
provided later in the year prior to the
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
extension date during our appeal to the
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
town the board the wolfboro board of
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
selectman was very sympathetic to our
 
02:37:33.269 --> 02:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
situation since we're an economic driver
 
02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
in the community we attract over 18,000
 
02:37:38.910 --> 02:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
people to the town each year who spend
 
02:37:41.389 --> 02:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
money on hotels and meals and retail
 
02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
stores however since the effective date
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
of the legislation HP 1055 that
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald talked about was
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
April 1st 2025 the town attorney did not
 
02:37:53.750 --> 02:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
did not support the board's
 
02:37:56.190 --> 02:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation to grant us an exemption
 
02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
as a result the museum lost its tax
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
exempt status for a year at a cost of
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
over $50,000 in real estate taxes this
 
02:38:05.710 --> 02:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
this represents more than 10% of our
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue um given the circumstances
 
02:38:09.469 --> 02:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
described above this seems to be a very
 
02:38:11.630 --> 02:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
severe penalty for a late administrative
 
02:38:14.110 --> 02:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
filing so as a result we support House
 
02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:14.830 align:start position:0%
filing so as a result we support House
Bill

02:38:14.830 --> 02:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
426 thank you thank you questions
 
02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
Misha good afternoon thank you madam
 
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
chair and committee members for the
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
record Jim misho Chief assessor for the
 
02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
town of Hudson I come before you I was
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
releas some questions about this bill uh
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
I first want to point out I'm I'm not an
 
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
attorney um but my written testimony uh
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
speaks to a possible unconstitutional
 
02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
provision with this bill the Hampshire
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution part one article 23
 
02:38:57.950 --> 02:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
retrospective law is prohibited
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
retrospective laws are highly injurious
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
suppressive and unjust no such laws
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
therefore should be made either for the
 
02:39:05.230 --> 02:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
decision of civil causes or the
 
02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
punishment of
 
02:39:09.630 --> 02:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
offenses the applicable law was
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
effective for April 1
 
02:39:15.309 --> 02:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
2025 it was not applicable for April 1
 
02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
2024 I don't know that a law can reach
 
02:39:20.910 --> 02:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
backwards to unspell milk I think the
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution says you can't further
 
02:39:26.349 --> 02:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
point out another issue there are
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
communities where the taxpayer the The
 
02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
Entity has appealed to the btla btla has
 
02:39:33.429 --> 02:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
agreed with the law there is no
 
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
exception for April 1 2024 and the late
 
02:39:38.790 --> 02:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
filing of the a12 so the btla has
 
02:39:41.469 --> 02:39:41.479 align:start position:0%
supported the law the btla has supported
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the uh Municipal assessing official
 
02:39:46.110 --> 02:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
decision and now what decision's been
 
02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
made correct you can't go backwards so
 
02:39:52.230 --> 02:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
you pass this law you have communities
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
that have to make a choice do they fall
 
02:39:57.070 --> 02:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
a foul of the btla judicial judicial
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
decision or do they follow this law that
 
02:40:07.389 --> 02:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.399 --> 02:40:09.309 align:start position:0%
 
conundrum

02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
conundrum
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
additionally it's like you're accepting
 
02:40:11.439 --> 02:40:12.469 align:start position:0%
additionally it's like you're accepting
the

02:40:12.469 --> 02:40:12.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:15.150 --> 02:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
application late that you have no
 
02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:16.150 align:start position:0%
application late that you have no
provision

02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:40:18.750 --> 02:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
for but even if you had a provision for
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
it you can't accept that form after the
 
02:40:23.269 --> 02:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
local tax rate has been set that's set
 
02:40:25.469 --> 02:40:25.479 align:start position:0%
out in law well all the tax rates for
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
2024 for almost all the communities in
 
02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
the state has already been set so how
 
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
can you accept something late for which
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
the tax rate's already been set it
 
02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
presents a
 
02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
problem it also presents a problem about
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
preceden what other bills are we going
 
02:40:41.950 --> 02:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
to see they're going to retrospectively
 
02:40:44.110 --> 02:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
change I don't know a zba appeal
 
02:40:45.790 --> 02:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
deadline a planning board appeal
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
deadline you can see where this might
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
become a unwise public policy
 
02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
decision lastly the bill appears to try
 
02:40:56.429 --> 02:40:56.439 align:start position:0%
to create a legislatively derived
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
specific reason property owner missing
 
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
deadline under the good cause provisions
 
02:41:02.309 --> 02:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
of RSA
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
7616 good cause is a recognized legal
 
02:41:06.750 --> 02:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
term that is used in this and other New
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes judicial system has
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
enumerated in case law a very few four
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
limited reasons for abatements and they
 
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
are on the btla municipal abatement
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
application none of them say missed the
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
deadline so I'm going to rest my
 
02:41:24.830 --> 02:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the written testimony goes
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
into a little bit more detail and I'll
 
02:41:28.030 --> 02:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
take any
 
02:41:31.389 --> 02:41:31.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%

to enrich lives of our communities

through the Arts education and cultural

02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
over a 100,000 patrons to the community
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
of conquered and our story is just one
 
02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
of hundreds across every town and city
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
in the state much like prior testimony
 
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
we heard today Capital Center for the
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
Arts is a living example of how this
 
02:42:50.830 --> 02:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
bill can affect an
 
02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
organization to date we've filed our
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
property tax exemption forms on time and
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
without issue for 30 years in a row in
 
02:43:01.830 --> 02:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
2024 we filed part one of the exemption
 
02:43:04.670 --> 02:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
on time the second part was filed no
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
more than 5 days late due to extenuating
 
02:43:09.230 --> 02:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
and reasonable circumstances that were
 
02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
beyond our control despite our best
 
02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
attempts to settle this matter locally
 
02:43:15.389 --> 02:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
we have not been successful and we are
 
02:43:17.469 --> 02:43:17.479 align:start position:0%
now appealing our case before Superior
 
02:43:20.269 --> 02:43:20.279 align:start position:0%
Court for a late property tax file fing
 
02:43:21.870 --> 02:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
and while I can understand inhere to the
 
02:43:23.790 --> 02:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations the strict and
 
02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
non-flexible deadline can prove to be
 
02:43:28.590 --> 02:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
destructive for organizations like ours
 
02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
there was no fine there's no
 
02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
consideration for it just a tax bill for
 
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
the total value of our properties which
 
02:43:37.950 --> 02:43:37.960 align:start position:0%

organization the results of these

flexibility to nonprofit organizations
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
and recognize the vital role we play in
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
our communities this legislation would
 
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
not only honor the intent of the current
 
02:44:15.469 --> 02:44:15.479 align:start position:0%
laws governing nonprofit exemptions but
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
would also align with New Hampshire's

commitment to fostering a driving
 
02:44:22.349 --> 02:44:22.359 align:start position:0%

02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
$3.4 billion of economic activity for
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
the state and which by the way is tied
 
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
with the construction industry arts and
 
02:44:36.349 --> 02:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
culture provide over 21,000 jobs for New
 
02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we seek a sensible policy
 
02:44:40.349 --> 02:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
for an industry that is so vital to our
 
02:44:42.950 --> 02:44:42.960 align:start position:0%

1:00 and we will resume our public
 
03:34:59.910 --> 03:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
hearings at this time I would like to
 
03:35:03.229 --> 03:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing for House Bill
 
03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
617 relative to the homestead
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
right we have with us this afternoon
 
03:35:13.110 --> 03:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lichfield to introduce
 
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
the legislation to us today welcome to
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
ipal and County government thank you
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you members of the
 
03:35:22.750 --> 03:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Melissa Lichfield
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I represent the towns of Brentwood
 
03:35:27.630 --> 03:35:27.640 align:start position:0%
Danville and Fremont today I'm here
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward the homestead
 
03:35:32.070 --> 03:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
right it was initially brought to me
 
03:35:33.429 --> 03:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
actually by a
 
03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
constituent in November um followed up
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
by an attorney in town who had also
 
03:35:41.110 --> 03:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
stated that there was a real need for
 
03:35:43.469 --> 03:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
this the gist of it is this is a law
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
that is actually already on the books
 
03:35:48.510 --> 03:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
um and simply just simply states that if
 
03:35:51.510 --> 03:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
for any reason you've gone into debt or
 
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
you've been sued right now you're
 
03:35:55.710 --> 03:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
covered up to
 
03:35:58.309 --> 03:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
$120,000 of your home so you wouldn't
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
lose the roof over your head if you're
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
married that doubles the problem is that
 
03:36:05.630 --> 03:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
this law hasn't kept up with the market
 
03:36:09.790 --> 03:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
value of the homes so I in doing my
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
research what I had done is I looked New
 
03:36:15.070 --> 03:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's wul low at 120,000 I
 
03:36:18.269 --> 03:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
researched all 50 states um some states
 
03:36:20.830 --> 03:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
for example Florida the value of the
 
03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
home is
 
03:36:25.269 --> 03:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
unlimited the average home in New
 
03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is about median home is about
 
03:36:31.710 --> 03:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
$480,000 I had actually put in this bill
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
up to a million dollar um I know that I
 
03:36:38.349 --> 03:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
need to put an amendment in I know the
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee owns this but if you would
 
03:36:42.309 --> 03:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
allow me to put an amendment originally
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
this bill was also supposed to mention
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
trusts and I didn't realize I apologize
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
until just a few minutes ago that trusts
 
03:36:52.269 --> 03:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
are not included in here um so at that
 
03:36:53.870 --> 03:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
point in time if you would prefer that
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
the amount be amended somewhere between
 
03:36:59.550 --> 03:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
500,000 and a million I understand I did
 
03:37:01.550 --> 03:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
not double it in the case of if you're
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
married because in my opinion the cost
 
03:37:05.790 --> 03:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
of a house is the cost of a house it
 
03:37:07.429 --> 03:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter whether or not you
 
03:37:07.439 --> 03:37:10.189 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter whether or not you
are

03:37:10.189 --> 03:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:10.199 --> 03:37:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
married

03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
married
 
03:37:15.630 --> 03:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
um I also tried to put some bumpers into
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
this law so for
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
example obviously if you have a mortgage
 
03:37:23.229 --> 03:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
or if you have a home equity um they can
 
03:37:26.590 --> 03:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
still seize your home okay if there are
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
outstanding loans let's say for um condo
 
03:37:32.550 --> 03:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
fees or HOA fees they can still take
 
03:37:32.560 --> 03:37:33.670 align:start position:0%
fees or HOA fees they can still take
your

03:37:33.670 --> 03:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
home the gist of it is just for to
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
protect you if let's say there is a
 
03:37:42.189 --> 03:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuit like a car accident or something
 
03:37:44.229 --> 03:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
along those lines where they're going
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
after the insurance money but these days
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
they don't feel as though the insurance
 
03:37:50.309 --> 03:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
money is enough so they're going after
 
03:37:52.229 --> 03:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
the roof over your head that's all my
 
03:37:54.429 --> 03:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
goal in this is just to protect the roof
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
head I also looked up and under Chapter
 
03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
7 bankruptcy in the United States um if
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
you meet certain requirements your home
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
is also protected there as well you're
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
up to date on your mortgage payments um
 
03:38:12.429 --> 03:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
you're able to continue with your future
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
payments and um it's it also me a
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
homestead exemption it says protect your
 
03:38:18.990 --> 03:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
home equity from creditors through a
 
03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:20.469 align:start position:0%
home equity from creditors through a
homestead

03:38:20.469 --> 03:38:20.479 align:start position:0%
homestead
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
exemption um I just if I may really
 
03:38:25.950 --> 03:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
quickly I had an expert witness that was
 
03:38:27.590 --> 03:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be here which was an
 
03:38:29.870 --> 03:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
attorney in our town and unfortunately
 
03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
he was unable to make it today so I just
 
03:38:35.790 --> 03:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you very briefly uh
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I am providing
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
this testimony and support of increasing
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
the homestead exemption as the prices of
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
homes have exponentially increased the
 
03:38:46.269 --> 03:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
homestead exemption has not
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
correspondingly kept up thus exposing
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
homeowners to judgment creditors it has
 
03:38:53.710 --> 03:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
been my experience that over the past 5
 
03:38:55.550 --> 03:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
years the growth of certain plaintiff's
 
03:38:57.910 --> 03:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
law firms often based outside of New
 
03:38:59.830 --> 03:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that can often be found on
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
billboards or television ads has also
 
03:39:03.950 --> 03:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
resulted in claims and lawsuits that
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
threaten homeowners in the past those
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
representing Plaines would be satisfied
 
03:39:10.590 --> 03:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
with going after insurance and would not
 
03:39:12.510 --> 03:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
seek to attach and go after someone's
 
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
home to satisfy their claim as
 
03:39:16.510 --> 03:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners have seen and acceleration in
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
their home values this has led to
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
certain firms using this Equity as a way
 
03:39:23.349 --> 03:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
to leverage greater monetary Awards the
 
03:39:24.990 --> 03:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
following are a couple of examples of
 
03:39:27.389 --> 03:39:27.399 align:start position:0%
this from my civil defense law practice
 
03:39:28.870 --> 03:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
I had a recent case involving a
 
03:39:30.590 --> 03:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
collision between two skiers on the
 
03:39:32.910 --> 03:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
slopes objectively this was not a
 
03:39:35.309 --> 03:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
situation involving Reckless conduct but
 
03:39:37.309 --> 03:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
rather was an accident between two
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
individuals whose path intersected
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
resulting in a collision unfortunately
 
03:39:43.710 --> 03:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
one of the skiers was hurt and as often
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
happens a lawsuit followed in this case
 
03:39:48.389 --> 03:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
the person was sued had a home and
 
03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
because of the threat that this home
 
03:39:51.910 --> 03:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be sold to pay off for the
 
03:39:53.670 --> 03:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
Judgment a greater settlement was
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
leveraged by the plaintiff's attorney um
 
03:39:57.950 --> 03:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
and then it just it goes on to mention
 
03:39:59.670 --> 03:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
how the homeowner had an elderly and Ill
 
03:40:02.469 --> 03:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
parent who he needed to take care of
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
leading to an unenviable situation um so
 
03:40:08.150 --> 03:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
the person actually settled for more so
 
03:40:10.030 --> 03:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't go after their home he
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
said while I support the Bill's increase
 
03:40:13.790 --> 03:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
to 1 million I do think that an amount
 
03:40:16.269 --> 03:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
between 500,000 to 1 million would be
 
03:40:18.510 --> 03:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable given that home ownership is
 
03:40:19.870 --> 03:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
something that everyone works and
 
03:40:21.870 --> 03:40:21.880 align:start position:0%
strives towards the equity of this one
 
03:40:23.910 --> 03:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
asset deserves greater protection in New
 
03:40:26.269 --> 03:40:26.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and then also I have
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
submitted from the constituent a letter
 
03:40:32.110 --> 03:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
too that you can look at um in your free
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
time to take a look at and I think
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's it I also just wanted to let you
 
03:40:40.830 --> 03:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
know the only reason why I don't have um
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
a plethora of Co co-sponsors on here
 
03:40:46.110 --> 03:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
simply I put the bill in right after the
 
03:40:48.750 --> 03:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
election we had that tight squeeze with
 
03:40:51.870 --> 03:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
OSS and there was a I think we all kind
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
of felt the growing pains with OLS this
 
03:40:56.790 --> 03:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
time around so that's simply all it was
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
chance thank you representative
 
03:41:06.030 --> 03:41:06.040 align:start position:0%

you for taking what I hope is a really
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
easy question why the effective date a
 
03:41:24.309 --> 03:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
year out 26 any any real reason for that
 
03:41:27.309 --> 03:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
no okay I just didn't know if there was
 
03:41:29.950 --> 03:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
any any any any provision of law which
 
03:41:32.309 --> 03:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
said we need to wait another year no in
 
03:41:34.910 --> 03:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
a in a perfect world honestly I would
 
03:41:37.830 --> 03:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
love to make it effective in 60 days but
 
03:41:39.630 --> 03:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to give time for
 
03:41:41.149 --> 03:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
everybody to get the laws changed and
 
03:41:44.229 --> 03:41:44.239 align:start position:0%

questions

03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:41:49.790 --> 03:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:52.750 --> 03:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
you next the chair calls
 
03:41:52.760 --> 03:42:01.870 align:start position:0%
you next the chair calls
representative

03:42:01.870 --> 03:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:10.189 --> 03:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
government thank you madam chair
 
03:42:12.429 --> 03:42:12.439 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee for
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
record representative Henry gas and
 
03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 29th
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
so I am always in support of anything
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
that protects our taxpayers our
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
homeowners and our and our citizens and
 
03:42:27.710 --> 03:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
this does exactly that um I actually for
 
03:42:29.550 --> 03:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
what it's worth I would not change the
 
03:42:31.149 --> 03:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
dollar amount from a million dollars
 
03:42:34.110 --> 03:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
simply because with 480 being the mean
 
03:42:37.030 --> 03:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
household many of us have more invested
 
03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
in our property and that's the one thing
 
03:42:40.309 --> 03:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
that we as civilians should be able to
 
03:42:41.750 --> 03:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
own as a piece of
 
03:42:44.710 --> 03:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
property um I like the Protections in
 
03:42:46.349 --> 03:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
this because you do see a lot of
 
03:42:48.590 --> 03:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
frivolous litigation one thing that I
 
03:42:50.910 --> 03:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
would like to see you know and um The
 
03:42:53.510 --> 03:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
Honorable sponsor of this suggested that
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
there would be an amendment going in to
 
03:42:57.670 --> 03:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
expand it to um Family trusts as well
 
03:42:59.870 --> 03:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that's very important uh one
 
03:43:01.389 --> 03:43:01.399 align:start position:0%
other thing I would like to see possibly
 
03:43:03.950 --> 03:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
removed from this is line 27 domestic
 
03:43:06.030 --> 03:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
support obligations because I have seen
 
03:43:08.830 --> 03:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits for alimon and child
 
03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
support cost foreclosures of houses and
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
you know while I do believe that is an
 
03:43:15.790 --> 03:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
obligation to take care of kids I do I
 
03:43:17.790 --> 03:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
also believe that frivolous litigation
 
03:43:20.429 --> 03:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
to go after somebody's home is exactly
 
03:43:21.910 --> 03:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
that it's frivolous and it causes
 
03:43:24.269 --> 03:43:24.279 align:start position:0%
homelessness which will impact their
 
03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
ability to support their child um or
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
support that alimony so I would like to
 
03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
see if that line could be stricken other
 
03:43:32.910 --> 03:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
than that this seems to be a very
 
03:43:34.670 --> 03:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
necessary piece of legislation to
 
03:43:36.429 --> 03:43:36.439 align:start position:0%
protect homeowners from frivolous
 
03:43:39.229 --> 03:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and i would support
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
03:43:48.750 --> 03:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:57.229 --> 03:43:57.239 align:start position:0%

government good afternoon and uh thank
 
03:44:03.910 --> 03:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
you for your time representative
 
03:44:06.269 --> 03:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
McFarland from Orange representing
 
03:44:06.279 --> 03:44:08.110 align:start position:0%
McFarland from Orange representing
Grafton

03:44:08.110 --> 03:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
Grafton
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
18 I uh first of all if you bear with me
 
03:44:14.110 --> 03:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
just want to give a a quick disclaimer
 
03:44:15.790 --> 03:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
this testimony represents My Views and
 
03:44:16.790 --> 03:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
the views and interests of my
 
03:44:18.510 --> 03:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
constituents in graft and 18 and my
 
03:44:20.950 --> 03:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
testimony is not made on behalf of any
 
03:44:22.830 --> 03:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
private employer nor should it be
 
03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
constru to represent the views of any of
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
my employers I'm here to speak in
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
support of uh House Bill
 
03:44:33.189 --> 03:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
617 I think that uh you've already heard
 
03:44:35.389 --> 03:44:35.399 align:start position:0%
most of the arguments that I could make
 
03:44:38.469 --> 03:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
and I do believe that the adjustment in
 
03:44:41.950 --> 03:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
the value here is overdue and well
 
03:44:45.710 --> 03:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
warranted um and I think it protects
 
03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh the interests of our our constituents
 
03:44:51.189 --> 03:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
and achieves a balance between the
 
03:44:56.030 --> 03:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
ability of creditors to uh obtain the
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the the repayments that they are
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
due uh the language in the bill I've
 
03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
heard some people comment on it and I
 
03:45:05.950 --> 03:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
have observed that that language is not
 
03:45:10.030 --> 03:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
in fact uh does not in fact act in the
 
03:45:13.189 --> 03:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
way that some have interpreted to act uh
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
it it strikes a very good balance I
 
03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
think and has Provisions in there that
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
would not result in the parade of
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
horribles that uh I think some of you
 
03:45:25.229 --> 03:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
may have heard nevertheless um uh I
 
03:45:26.670 --> 03:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
think the other arguments as I said have
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
already been made so I yield to any
 
03:45:30.229 --> 03:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
questions there may
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
be thank you
 
03:45:37.510 --> 03:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thanks thank
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
you and the last pink card that I have
 
03:45:47.670 --> 03:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.110 --> 03:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:57.389 --> 03:45:57.399 align:start position:0%
government uh Madam
 
03:46:00.510 --> 03:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
chair uh members of the committee I'm
 
03:46:02.070 --> 03:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
Attorney Charles Russell I've been
 
03:46:04.510 --> 03:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
practicing law U probably no more than
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
three blocks from the state house since
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
the 70s I wanted to share my experience
 
03:46:11.710 --> 03:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh way back it was 30,000 then it went
 
03:46:15.030 --> 03:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
to 50 And1 120 where it stands now that
 
03:46:16.429 --> 03:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
was the amount certainly it needs
 
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment for that reason um uh I also
 
03:46:21.870 --> 03:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
speak because I've done bankruptcies
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
utilize the homestead exemption but
 
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
there was a case that came down in the
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court in um uh
 
03:46:32.990 --> 03:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
August of uh 2023 the Brady versus susky
 
03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
case where they basically said um a
 
03:46:39.030 --> 03:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
spouse if her name or his or her name
 
03:46:41.510 --> 03:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
was not on the deed could not claim the
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
homestead right and so that a um a
 
03:46:46.950 --> 03:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
couple that went bankrupt was only
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
because she wasn't on the deed was only
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
able to claim it once and uh that
 
03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
decision uh spoke to whether there need
 
03:46:58.030 --> 03:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
to be legislative changes or not um and
 
03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
I would suggest there is and I think
 
03:47:02.349 --> 03:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
what happened is there was the homestead
 
03:47:03.870 --> 03:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
exemption and generally the homestead
 
03:47:06.149 --> 03:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
exemption goes way back to the 1800s
 
03:47:08.189 --> 03:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
early 1900s where the husband would be
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
on the deed the wife wouldn't be there
 
03:47:12.870 --> 03:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
the husband died you let the Widow stay
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the house for the remainder of her
 
03:47:14.640 --> 03:47:15.710 align:start position:0%
in the house for the remainder of her
life

03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:47:18.510 --> 03:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
then uh probably in the 80s they put
 
03:47:20.309 --> 03:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
something in there about manufactured
 
03:47:22.269 --> 03:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
housing and and I think that led to the
 
03:47:24.189 --> 03:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
confusion with the Supreme Court making
 
03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
the decision that it did I would suggest
 
03:47:28.630 --> 03:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
that you split out any provision
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
pertaining to manufactured housing from
 
03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
including it from non or general
 
03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
residential uh property um because I
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
think that was the cause of the
 
03:47:41.309 --> 03:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
confusion um looking down at the bill I
 
03:47:43.670 --> 03:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
would suggest in bankruptcy if somebody
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
makes a claim of a home homestead
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
exemption and then they subsequently
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
sell the property that homestead
 
03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
exemption extends onto the money that
 
03:47:54.030 --> 03:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
are the proceeds here the treatment in
 
03:47:56.149 --> 03:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
this bill was you give somebody six
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
months to reinvest that money I would
 
03:48:00.630 --> 03:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
suggest given the current difficulties
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
in finding houses to to uh to buy you
 
03:48:05.550 --> 03:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
may want to make that 12 months as
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to six months and and take that
 
03:48:12.070 --> 03:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
that is in uh section uh section two um
 
03:48:14.469 --> 03:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
further down I would indicate uh the
 
03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
current language says the homestead
 
03:48:20.189 --> 03:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
exemption homestead exemption doesn't
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
apply in the collection of taxes I would
 
03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
suggest you be more specific I believe
 
03:48:27.070 --> 03:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
that should apply to what's called
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes and not taxes from some
 
03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
other source like I know in bankruptcy
 
03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
federal income taxes are pretty much
 
03:48:38.030 --> 03:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
treated like any other uh like any other
 
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh creditor bills um as to uh medical
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
debt um I would suggest that's an
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
approach riate uh uh situation I'd also
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
say there's a provision that talks about
 
03:48:53.149 --> 03:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
basically when you get a mortgage you
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't get the mortgage unless you wave
 
03:48:57.429 --> 03:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
your homestead right so that basically
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
the mortgage would take first POS uh
 
03:49:02.110 --> 03:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
position so when it uses a language
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
which is made a charge if the homestead
 
03:49:06.910 --> 03:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
right has been waved in the mortgage
 
03:49:09.309 --> 03:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
that language would clear it up I've
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
also had experience on the sheriff sale
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the language there I've
 
03:49:15.790 --> 03:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
actually used use that in a case
 
03:49:18.349 --> 03:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
probably in the last 10 years and
 
03:49:22.189 --> 03:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
basically that reflects a policy that um
 
03:49:24.830 --> 03:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
a person's Homestead right takes
 
03:49:27.269 --> 03:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
precedent you over somebody's bills and
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
you can't out somebody in an ERA with a
 
03:49:31.510 --> 03:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
lot of homelessness and everything else
 
03:49:32.990 --> 03:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
you want to make sure the homestead
 
03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
right takes precedent over a creditor
 
03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
Bill coming in a lot of it is credit
 
03:49:38.469 --> 03:49:38.479 align:start position:0%
card debt and other things that I've
 
03:49:40.349 --> 03:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
seen in bankruptcies and most of those
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
debts including medical debts are
 
03:49:44.189 --> 03:49:44.199 align:start position:0%
discharged in bankruptcy which is a
 
03:49:46.510 --> 03:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
federal proceeding but uh other
 
03:49:49.870 --> 03:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise um for those comments um I
 
03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a a pretty good bill uh in
 
03:49:56.229 --> 03:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
law school I learned right so you're not
 
03:49:59.790 --> 03:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
misunderstood so where you have a charge
 
03:50:03.309 --> 03:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
uh prop taxes are exempt you should be
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
putting in their real estate or property
 
03:50:09.070 --> 03:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.950 --> 03:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
questions questions the chair recognizes
 
03:50:14.429 --> 03:50:14.439 align:start position:0%
representative Elward thank you madam
 
03:50:17.229 --> 03:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
chair chman and thank you sir for your
 
03:50:19.510 --> 03:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
testimony what line are you talking
 
03:50:23.110 --> 03:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
about that needs to have
 
03:50:27.630 --> 03:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
property uh delineated property there is
 
03:50:30.469 --> 03:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
a looks like in section
 
03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
three um no I'm sorry section
 
03:50:38.349 --> 03:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
two line
 
03:50:41.830 --> 03:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the homestead right does not
 
03:50:44.910 --> 03:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
cancel or raise any debts the home dead
 
03:50:47.229 --> 03:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
right is exempt from attachment during
 
03:50:47.239 --> 03:50:48.309 align:start position:0%
right is exempt from attachment during
its

03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
its
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
continuance for except for the following
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
ta things and then it so I think that's
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
two Roman numeral one the in the
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
collection of taxes I would add in the
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
collection of property taxes and then
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
there's a further provision that um I
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
was involved in the case on homeowner
 
03:51:08.309 --> 03:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
associations that the result of that
 
03:51:10.590 --> 03:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
case resulted in the condo associations
 
03:51:13.229 --> 03:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
coming in and saying uh condo fees
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
that's further down so
 
03:51:17.630 --> 03:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise I mean despite all my comments
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's a Well drafted bill with
 
03:51:22.070 --> 03:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
some of the comments there it protects
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
people whether that number is
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
500,000 certainly it needs to at least
 
03:51:29.070 --> 03:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
go to that if not a million I would also
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
say um you you asked about this we spoke
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
earlier that the homestead right can be
 
03:51:38.910 --> 03:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
claimed whether or not The spouse's name
 
03:51:41.110 --> 03:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
is on the deed I think that's what
 
03:51:42.990 --> 03:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
happened in the bankruptcy case that
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
went to the Supreme Court the Brady case
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
so so basically uh you know and and that
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
comes up
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
one somebody buys a house gets married
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
later it's a second to third marriage
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
the wife's name or the husband's name
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
may not end up on the deed but if
 
03:52:02.149 --> 03:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
they're living there and you have that
 
03:52:03.750 --> 03:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
provision there they have to have lived
 
03:52:05.389 --> 03:52:05.399 align:start position:0%
there for the last 12 months I'm sorry
 
03:52:10.950 --> 03:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
to be too long go ahead followup
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes so would that protection carry over
 
03:52:15.600 --> 03:52:17.070 align:start position:0%
yes so would that protection carry over
to

03:52:17.070 --> 03:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:52:21.429 --> 03:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:21.439 --> 03:52:23.710 align:start position:0%
 
partner

03:52:23.710 --> 03:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
partner
 
03:52:26.550 --> 03:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
um You probably all know more than about
 
03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
civil unions and things like that
 
03:52:32.110 --> 03:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
um I think the trust needs to be in
 
03:52:33.990 --> 03:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
there but uh you probably ought to have
 
03:52:36.870 --> 03:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
some language in there I mean if if
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
if same gender people marry I think they
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
refer to each other as husband and wife
 
03:52:44.590 --> 03:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
and spouse
 
03:52:46.590 --> 03:52:46.600 align:start position:0%
so it may go to that definition to the
 
03:52:49.630 --> 03:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
extent it applies to civil unions if in
 
03:52:55.189 --> 03:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
fact that has been um legally set up so
 
03:52:57.870 --> 03:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
good point loophole that needs to be
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
covered thank you sir anything further
 
03:53:00.880 --> 03:53:02.510 align:start position:0%
covered thank you sir anything further
additional

03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none appreciate your
 
03:53:08.950 --> 03:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:12.070 --> 03:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
you so at this time the chair recognizes
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman to report out on
 
03:53:19.229 --> 03:53:19.239 align:start position:0%

the time is now 1:30 and I will open the

oversight committee this bill and the
 
04:02:14.349 --> 04:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
one immediately following it have the
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
same backstory so allow me to give you
 
04:02:20.389 --> 04:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh an informal rendering of that story
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
for decades in fact for centuries the
 
04:02:26.710 --> 04:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
towns in New Hampshire had a wonderful
 
04:02:29.950 --> 04:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the nonprofits
 
04:02:31.870 --> 04:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
some of those were churches some of
 
04:02:33.550 --> 04:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
those were fraternal
 
04:02:36.229 --> 04:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
organizations but what the those groups
 
04:02:38.429 --> 04:02:38.439 align:start position:0%
did was provide a lot of help and
 
04:02:40.269 --> 04:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
assistance to the individuals in the
 
04:02:42.950 --> 04:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
town as a result the relationship with
 
04:02:44.349 --> 04:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
the town was
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
and some of this is
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh they would not be
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
taxed on their
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
properties this was mostly
 
04:02:55.469 --> 04:02:55.479 align:start position:0%
informal in many cases the town fathers
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
they were just fathers back then later
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
fathers and mothers and the people in
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
the organizations that often served for
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
Generations it was just the way things
 
04:03:04.319 --> 04:03:05.309 align:start position:0%
Generations it was just the way things
were

04:03:05.309 --> 04:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
done unfortunately there was a court
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
case a few years back where an
 
04:03:14.110 --> 04:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
charitable organization asserted some
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
things that seemed to go outside the
 
04:03:18.189 --> 04:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
normal way of doing things they had
 
04:03:20.030 --> 04:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
numbers of properties and they wanted
 
04:03:22.510 --> 04:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
tax exemption for all of them this led
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
to a court case the church as it turned
 
04:03:29.550 --> 04:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
out lost the court case and as a pastor
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
let me just say I think the church
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
should have lost that court case and
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
that let loose a an idea of gee what are
 
04:03:39.309 --> 04:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
we doing in our town you know it's been
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
a quote gentleman's agreement for all
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
these decades and centuries what are we
 
04:03:47.830 --> 04:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
doing here a company stepped forward and
 
04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
said that that'd helped the towns figure
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
out who had tax exempt status who didn't
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
who should who shouldn't what the rules
 
04:03:57.990 --> 04:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
might be and it led to a lot of chaos I
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
wound up getting a tax bill for
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
$88,000 for my
 
04:04:06.830 --> 04:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
church and really folks now the folks in
 
04:04:09.070 --> 04:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
Kingston New Hampshire are wonderful but
 
04:04:10.349 --> 04:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
they didn't know what to do this had
 
04:04:12.550 --> 04:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
never come up before suddenly an
 
04:04:14.550 --> 04:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
organization told this is what we think
 
04:04:18.030 --> 04:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
you could do it took a little while to
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
straighten this out and we got a refund
 
04:04:24.070 --> 04:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
but numbers of town officials and
 
04:04:27.790 --> 04:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
numbers of organizations churches
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
fraternal organizations and soone said
 
04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid some of this stuff needs to
 
04:04:36.429 --> 04:04:36.439 align:start position:0%
be codified now for too long it's been a
 
04:04:39.389 --> 04:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
working agreement but now I think we've
 
04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
got to get it in law so they approached
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
me they said would I do something about
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
it and I tried to research it I tried to
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
come up with something that was
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
fair this first bill before you has
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
mostly to do with church properties for
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
its clergy members there's a few other
 
04:05:01.229 --> 04:05:01.239 align:start position:0%
things in there but this is the main
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill it has been
 
04:05:06.030 --> 04:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
adjudicated all the way up to the
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that a churches call it a
 
04:05:12.990 --> 04:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
rectory a mans a parsonage it's the
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
clergy members home is an extension of
 
04:05:19.630 --> 04:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
the church and therefore is not real
 
04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
estate tax
 
04:05:25.950 --> 04:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
taxable and that worked well most clergy
 
04:05:28.870 --> 04:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
members lived right next to their
 
04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
church and so that's obvious that
 
04:05:33.389 --> 04:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
building is next to the big tall
 
04:05:35.550 --> 04:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
building but what started happening
 
04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
about 50 or 60 years ago is in many
 
04:05:40.110 --> 04:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
cases these downtown churches
 
04:05:42.349 --> 04:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods were changing and the
 
04:05:44.189 --> 04:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
clergy memb said I'm not so sure I want
 
04:05:47.910 --> 04:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
to raise my family right downtown I'd
 
04:05:49.590 --> 04:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
rather be out in the suburbs with most
 
04:05:53.349 --> 04:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
of my members in addition clergy we
 
04:05:54.830 --> 04:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
starting to say wait a minute I've just
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
turned 70 I'm retiring I have no equity
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
in a house because the house has always
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
been provided for me so that's when
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
something called a housing allowance was
 
04:06:11.670 --> 04:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
developed and again this passed muster
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
all the way up and down the IRS
 
04:06:16.630 --> 04:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh recognizes this I have been in this
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
for almost 50 years myself and what that
 
04:06:22.149 --> 04:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
means is that the church will give the
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
clergy member a sum of money that will
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
take care of property tax maintenance
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
utilities all of
 
04:06:35.790 --> 04:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
that but then the question arises what
 
04:06:37.950 --> 04:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
do we do with the old rectory sitting
 
04:06:40.429 --> 04:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
downtown and some Churches have decided
 
04:06:42.269 --> 04:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
to rent it
 
04:06:45.710 --> 04:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
out G money and by the way the money
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
that they gain from running it out
 
04:06:49.070 --> 04:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much becomes the housing
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
allowance they give to the clergy member
 
04:06:52.189 --> 04:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
in other words it
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
washes well some towns are saying oh no
 
04:06:56.950 --> 04:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
if you've got other people in there
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
paying rent on that that's an incom
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
producing property and we don't think
 
04:07:02.110 --> 04:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
that should be the case we're going to
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
tax the rectory
 
04:07:06.750 --> 04:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
now the majority of towns say no we
 
04:07:08.910 --> 04:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
understand what it's like to have a wash
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
the rental income you get becomes the
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
money we use to give the housing
 
04:07:15.389 --> 04:07:15.399 align:start position:0%
allowance for the clergy member who's
 
04:07:17.950 --> 04:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
now living out in the suburbs
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere this bill would simply say in
 
04:07:25.510 --> 04:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
law yeah that's what we ought to do but
 
04:07:27.630 --> 04:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
it will go a little further because what
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
if a church owns five or six houses well
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's where the court case started the
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
second richest religious organization in
 
04:07:39.469 --> 04:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
the world is Trinity Church Wall Street
 
04:07:43.550 --> 04:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
New York their Church land is not to
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
taxed the cemetery next door is not
 
04:07:50.670 --> 04:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
taxed the rectory next door is not taxed
 
04:07:52.349 --> 04:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
but all those buildings on Wall Street
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
are owned by Trinity Church and you
 
04:07:56.109 --> 04:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
better believe they are taxed as any
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
other building in New York is
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
taxed so this says both to the churches
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
if you're just doing this wash it's a
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
continuation in a way of what you've
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
been doing and what everybody's been
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing for a long time but if you
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to go on buying real estate and
 
04:08:16.109 --> 04:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
doing various other things that's okay
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
you can make a profit on it but you're
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
going to pay real estate tax too so
 
04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
do thank you
 
04:08:30.510 --> 04:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:08:32.670 --> 04:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um would this
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
apply to um just a single family
 
04:08:42.510 --> 04:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
residence or a multif family property
 
04:08:42.520 --> 04:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
residence or a multif family property
duplex

04:08:44.630 --> 04:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
duplex
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
is there is there a limit to what this
 
04:08:49.630 --> 04:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
um this property can look like it is
 
04:08:52.229 --> 04:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
whatever the church or synagogue or
 
04:08:55.149 --> 04:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
mosque or what have you has been using
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the past traditionally as their
 
04:09:01.109 --> 04:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
clergy members dwelling and if that's a
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
a tiny little thing or a bigger thing
 
04:09:06.550 --> 04:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
the bill makes no distinction on
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
that F other questions representative
 
04:09:11.950 --> 04:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chairwoman and
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
question and and if I understood
 
04:09:18.990 --> 04:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
correctly it does not seem to matter or
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
make a difference if it is one lot with
 
04:09:24.189 --> 04:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
both of those buildings these do not
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
need to be contiguous Lots they could be
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
separate lots of record as long as they
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
are owned by the one entity correct yeah
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I am familiar with a few churches
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
who for whatever reason lay of the land
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
topography or whatever cited their
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
original parsonage around the corner so
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily have to be
 
04:09:46.750 --> 04:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
contiguous it would just simply have to
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
be one unit not a lot of units thank you
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
yep representative frock is recognized
 
04:09:57.070 --> 04:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam
 
04:10:00.269 --> 04:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
in uh Roman numeral
 
04:10:08.830 --> 04:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
3B it states that the real estate um
 
04:10:11.070 --> 04:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
rented to another
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
organization that shares a similar
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
Mission or goal shall be
 
04:10:15.760 --> 04:10:18.670 align:start position:0%
Mission or goal shall be
exempt

04:10:18.670 --> 04:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
04:10:23.790 --> 04:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
um organizations don't usually have
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
residences they would have an office
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps and if the organization is then
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
subletting to a tenant for whatever
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
reason they want to would the property
 
04:10:41.710 --> 04:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
then be taxable or not
 
04:10:46.109 --> 04:10:46.119 align:start position:0%
taxable if it is within the stated
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
mission of that organization that the
 
04:10:52.149 --> 04:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts division of Judiciary
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
and believe me I know them well um says
 
04:10:58.349 --> 04:10:58.359 align:start position:0%
oh yes this is this is part of your
 
04:10:58.359 --> 04:10:59.870 align:start position:0%
oh yes this is this is part of your
mission

04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
mission
 
04:11:02.349 --> 04:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
statement then this is an extension of
 
04:11:05.710 --> 04:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
that Ministry or organization's purpose
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
and it would be non-t taxable if it is
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
not gerain if it is not relevant let's
 
04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
say the organization who whose purpose
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
is to provide uh daily comfort for
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
wounded veterans if they rent it out to
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
something quite different than that it
 
04:11:26.710 --> 04:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
would be taxable if it is seen
 
04:11:30.990 --> 04:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
reasonably seen as a similar Mission
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's tax exempt this is fairly much
 
04:11:35.830 --> 04:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
what towns have been doing for a
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
while it just codifies it thank
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
you further questions
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and I do have uh
 
04:11:47.439 --> 04:11:48.830 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you and I do have uh
written

04:11:48.830 --> 04:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
sorry at this time oh there weren't any
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
more questions I didn't see any yeah we
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
have another pin card I haven't filled
 
04:12:09.030 --> 04:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
out pink cards have I yeah you need to
 
04:12:11.109 --> 04:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
fill one I know that I yell at people
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
for not doing that
 
04:12:16.349 --> 04:12:16.359 align:start position:0%
so at this time I have a pink card on
 
04:12:29.189 --> 04:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.990 --> 04:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
Misha good afternoon again committee
 
04:12:33.710 --> 04:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
members uh for the record Jim misho
 
04:12:36.030 --> 04:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
Chief assessor of the town of Hudson um
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
I do have some written
 
04:12:39.910 --> 04:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm going to focus on how the
 
04:12:44.269 --> 04:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill is written versus the existing law
 
04:12:44.279 --> 04:12:46.950 align:start position:0%
bill is written versus the existing law
so

04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
um a good portion of this bill lines 11
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
through 18 are covered word for word and
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
585 uh which is being heard by house
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee tomorrow so I'm
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how two bills basically
 
04:13:03.070 --> 04:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing get introduced to
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
two different committees but that's what
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
happened in regards to lines 8 through
 
04:13:13.550 --> 04:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.550 --> 04:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
that is already covered under existing
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
law in my handout I have a clip of
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
7223 and it says that the real estate
 
04:13:24.189 --> 04:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
and personal property owned by any
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
organization described above religious
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
organizations paragraphs
 
04:13:30.349 --> 04:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
3 occupied and used by another
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
organization described in said paragraph
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
so they're not owning it but they're
 
04:13:36.910 --> 04:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
using it but they
 
04:13:39.790 --> 04:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
have the uh similar kind of uh
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
charitable or religious uh requirement
 
04:13:46.149 --> 04:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
or or obligation um that that real
 
04:13:48.189 --> 04:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
estate stays not taxable that's the
 
04:13:51.389 --> 04:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
meaning of paragraph 5A in
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
7223 I would argue that the proposal in
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
this bill actually introduces ambiguity
 
04:14:00.269 --> 04:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
that doesn't not currently exist in law
 
04:14:03.030 --> 04:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
um it you know similar Mission or goal
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
shall be exempt from taxation if if the
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
language in 5A is not clear I haven't
 
04:14:10.590 --> 04:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
seen a court case that says the language
 
04:14:13.870 --> 04:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
in 5A is not clear so I argue that the
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
words in lines 8 through 11 are not
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
necessary it's already covered in
 
04:14:21.109 --> 04:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
statute uh in regards to lines 11
 
04:14:25.429 --> 04:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
through 18 um this talks about making
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
sure that if they are renting it out to
 
04:14:28.159 --> 04:14:28.910 align:start position:0%
sure that if they are renting it out to
an

04:14:28.910 --> 04:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
organization um rents out not more than
 
04:14:33.149 --> 04:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
one Church parage rather the similar
 
04:14:36.429 --> 04:14:36.439 align:start position:0%
residential real estate that um the
 
04:14:38.429 --> 04:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
rental income can only be used for the
 
04:14:41.710 --> 04:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
following U following points religious
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
leaders compensation maintenance of the
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
worship building of par Etc so if the
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
intention is to add more specificity in
 
04:14:52.429 --> 04:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
the law then you'll need we should have
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the btla be um ordered um to recreate
 
04:15:00.429 --> 04:15:00.439 align:start position:0%
their form A9 so the local officials can
 
04:15:02.229 --> 04:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not that rental
 
04:15:04.229 --> 04:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
income is being used for those
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
purposes it's introducing more
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
specificity but we don't have a form
 
04:15:09.750 --> 04:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
that addresses that kind of
 
04:15:09.760 --> 04:15:11.510 align:start position:0%
that addresses that kind of
specificity

04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
specificity
 
04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
um I think a lot of the bills that are
 
04:15:16.149 --> 04:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
that have been introduced on this are
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
picking at different parts of RSA
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
7223 I really would encourage the House
 
04:15:23.950 --> 04:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
and Senate to look at them all together
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
and determine what parts of the law
 
04:15:27.510 --> 04:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
should be changed and what's the law
 
04:15:29.830 --> 04:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
parts of the law should not be because
 
04:15:32.429 --> 04:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
if we end up doing this peace meal at
 
04:15:34.109 --> 04:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
the end of it I don't think it's going
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
to be a law that's going to be able to
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
be fairly administered at the local
 
04:15:38.109 --> 04:15:38.119 align:start position:0%
level and I don't think it's going to be
 
04:15:39.189 --> 04:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
something that the stakeholders are
 
04:15:41.469 --> 04:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
really going to be happy for happy with
 
04:15:43.710 --> 04:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
beware of unintended consequences comes
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
to mind thank
 
04:15:49.469 --> 04:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative majori thank
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman it may be a
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort I'm I'm looking to
 
04:15:57.309 --> 04:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
the chair and and maybe to the chairman
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the room uh so as Mr misho has just
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
said uh 585 has the same language as in
 
04:16:08.030 --> 04:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
subsection C here and we have a bill
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
what happens if is that something that
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
happens at the clerk level if both these
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
bills Advance or would there be an
 
04:16:18.030 --> 04:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
effort on our behalf could there be an
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
effort on our behalf to collaborate does
 
04:16:21.080 --> 04:16:22.670 align:start position:0%
effort on our behalf to collaborate does
anybody

04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
fails that that's un that's unclear It's
 
04:16:36.109 --> 04:16:36.119 align:start position:0%
Curious that we have two bills that
 
04:16:40.030 --> 04:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
allegedly are essentially the
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
same so a possible res solution is that
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
whatever bill or bills advance to the
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
Senate it could be
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
resolved um in the other
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
inquire further
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
04:17:12.030 --> 04:17:12.040 align:start position:0%

13 in
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
opposition and the blue sheet today has
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%

home we are slightly ahead of schedule
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
so we will need to wait
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.760 --> 04:18:41.710 align:start position:0%

04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
next on our schedule we have a bill
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 150 and with with that I
 
04:21:25.950 --> 04:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
will open the public hearing on House
 
04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 421 FN relative to notice of tax
 
04:21:33.870 --> 04:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
exempt status filing procedures by Town
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
officials or
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
offices I would like to welcome
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson to introduce the
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.950 --> 04:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman members of
 
04:21:49.950 --> 04:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
the committee to pick up on an earlier
 
04:21:52.149 --> 04:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
Point having been a chairman for several
 
04:21:54.990 --> 04:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
years now I have experienced on many
 
04:21:57.149 --> 04:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
occasions getting two or three or four
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
bills on roughly the same subject I have
 
04:22:01.630 --> 04:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
said why didn't they get their act
 
04:22:03.870 --> 04:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
together uh people have said that about
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature for a long
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
time the simple fact is sometimes we
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
don't know what somebody else is doing
 
04:22:12.750 --> 04:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
I've often thought this should should be
 
04:22:15.389 --> 04:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
a clearing house but I didn't say that
 
04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
too loudly or I would be named to run it
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
but so I understand that and you know I
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
think most of us are flexible we'll work
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
on stuff you get some ideas we can get
 
04:22:29.950 --> 04:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
it done this is a similar
 
04:22:31.910 --> 04:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
Bill and there's going to be an
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendment because
 
04:22:33.840 --> 04:22:35.229 align:start position:0%
amendment because
[Music]

04:22:35.229 --> 04:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:41.710 --> 04:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
um the bill as you look at it does not
 
04:22:41.720 --> 04:22:43.389 align:start position:0%
um the bill as you look at it does not
quite

04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
quite
 
04:22:45.750 --> 04:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
reflect what I
 
04:22:48.429 --> 04:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
wanted I'll only say that so the
 
04:22:50.590 --> 04:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it what I wanted here's
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
the thing again for
 
04:22:57.389 --> 04:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
forever sometime around April the town
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
wants you to fill out a few forms send
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
them in that demonstrates why you should
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
keep your tax exempt
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
status most nonprofit
 
04:23:13.149 --> 04:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
organizations have a volunteer team
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
they're probably pretty good at their
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
mission they're not necessarily so good
 
04:23:20.590 --> 04:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
at the business of running an
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
organization as a result sometimes
 
04:23:22.920 --> 04:23:23.750 align:start position:0%
organization as a result sometimes
people

04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
forget I remember standing in the men's
 
04:23:30.109 --> 04:23:30.119 align:start position:0%
room with Bill Gardner secretar State he
 
04:23:32.910 --> 04:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
looks over at me and said haven't got
 
04:23:32.920 --> 04:23:34.149 align:start position:0%
looks over at me and said haven't got
your

04:23:34.149 --> 04:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:23:38.510 --> 04:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
report I said how late are we two
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
years I said oh my gosh we're dead and
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
he said
 
04:23:45.630 --> 04:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
if I came at all the nonprofits that
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
didn't fill out the Farms the way they
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
should and shut them down half the
 
04:23:51.910 --> 04:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
charitable work in estate would die but
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
you got to get the farm in will you yes
 
04:23:57.389 --> 04:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
sir so I did and that was the attitude
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
you know unless this somebody that
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
really looks kind of sleazy most of
 
04:24:03.630 --> 04:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
these organizations are just trying to
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
do good for
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
people and sometimes we
 
04:24:11.670 --> 04:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
forget normally a town I understand will
 
04:24:14.070 --> 04:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
send out notice usually about now middle
 
04:24:17.149 --> 04:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
of February saying this is due on pick a
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
date April
 
04:24:20.910 --> 04:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
15th and they'll tell you you have to
 
04:24:25.149 --> 04:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
have the what is it 9 81 some of those
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
and so we'll find somebody who can fill
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
them out and make them look like they
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
did last year since nothing's changed
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
and send them in and all as
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
well sometimes I forgot and I'd get a
 
04:24:38.510 --> 04:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
call from Kingston Town Hall saying you
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
got to get your for and sorry I'm sorry
 
04:24:42.630 --> 04:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
and they said all right just fil and
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
drive it up and I
 
04:24:49.269 --> 04:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
would sometimes I didn't get a
 
04:24:53.189 --> 04:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
form and since I'm not a very good
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
administrator if they didn't tell me I
 
04:24:58.750 --> 04:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have remembered from last year
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
but get the form filled out and send it
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
in and that worked sort of pretty well
 
04:25:07.830 --> 04:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
most of the time you know Bill Garder
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
comment to me the town halls comment to
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
me but once again in response to the
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
court case some towns are tightening up
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
last year I didn't get a letter from the
 
04:25:23.309 --> 04:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
town so I didn't send in the
 
04:25:26.590 --> 04:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
forms I eventually did sending in the
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
same forms I did the previous several
 
04:25:32.790 --> 04:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
years but although I never had to send
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
in a 990 for one of the similar
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that uses our land I never
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
did and they came back to me and said
 
04:25:43.189 --> 04:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
where's the 990 on there I said I know
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
what a 990 is why do you need it well
 
04:25:48.790 --> 04:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's required I said okay I'll get it to
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
you that led to a discussion and I've
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
had this discussion with some Town
 
04:25:56.269 --> 04:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
officials elsewhere and some leaders of
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
nonprofits saying can't we just codify
 
04:26:03.229 --> 04:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
it can't we just say that 60 days ahead
 
04:26:05.910 --> 04:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the forms
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
being do you got to send us a letter and
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
you got to tell us exactly what you want
 
04:26:15.389 --> 04:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
and if you forget that's okay just don't
 
04:26:15.399 --> 04:26:16.550 align:start position:0%
and if you forget that's okay just don't
penalize

04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
penalize
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
us if you forgot and you know we didn't
 
04:26:23.389 --> 04:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
remember we'll get the forms in nobody's
 
04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
out to con anybody you've always said
 
04:26:28.309 --> 04:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
we're tax exempt so that's what this
 
04:26:32.349 --> 04:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
bill before you as amended seeks to do
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
the language in what you have before you
 
04:26:34.960 --> 04:26:35.750 align:start position:0%
the language in what you have before you
is

04:26:35.750 --> 04:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
confusing the language in the amendment
 
04:26:41.109 --> 04:26:41.119 align:start position:0%
that I'll be passing around to you says
 
04:26:44.149 --> 04:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
what I I wanted to to say so that's very
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
simple just let us know and we'll do the
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
best we can and if somehow you forget
 
04:26:52.269 --> 04:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
don't revoke our tax exempt status we're
 
04:26:54.630 --> 04:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of good work here and we're

and operated for 10 years I'm
sorry

04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:28:51.870 --> 04:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
um and we found a a pro bono
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
CPA who did our informational
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
filings would you give me that person's
 
04:29:01.109 --> 04:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
contact information offline please we
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
also had a pro bono attorney firm Law
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
Firm that um made sure that we were in
 
04:29:12.910 --> 04:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
order there's a thing called called a
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
calendar that you can write deadline
 
04:29:16.920 --> 04:29:18.030 align:start position:0%
calendar that you can write deadline
dates

04:29:18.030 --> 04:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
dates
 
04:29:20.590 --> 04:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
on and I'm I'm
 
04:29:23.070 --> 04:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
just this is rubbing me just a little
 
04:29:24.990 --> 04:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
bit the wrong way I think it puts a
 
04:29:27.469 --> 04:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
burden on the
 
04:29:30.429 --> 04:29:30.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities um for having to do what
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
is the organization's
 
04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility which is to remember when
 
04:29:38.149 --> 04:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
the deadline and is what what you need
 
04:29:42.149 --> 04:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
to file so whereas I I think this this
 
04:29:42.159 --> 04:29:43.229 align:start position:0%
to file so whereas I I think this this
is

04:29:43.229 --> 04:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
laudable I'm just a little miffed that
 
04:29:46.640 --> 04:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
laudable I'm just a little miffed that
these

04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:29:52.269 --> 04:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
organizations want a bit of
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
a pass you know and and putting the
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
burden on the towns to to WR remind
 
04:30:04.070 --> 04:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
them I'll take that as a question um I
 
04:30:06.389 --> 04:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
would mostly agree with you uh that's a
 
04:30:09.429 --> 04:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
would you believe uh and I would mostly
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
agree with you and if you saw my office
 
04:30:13.109 --> 04:30:13.119 align:start position:0%
you would see several sticky notes
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
reminding me exactly of this but I will
 
04:30:17.630 --> 04:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
say in the terms of the
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
990 uh nothing had changed in our
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
organization in years if they wanted us
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
to have a 990 we would have provided it
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
but when we turned in the paperwork that
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
last year and there was not a 990
 
04:30:32.109 --> 04:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
attached that was not our fault if they
 
04:30:33.870 --> 04:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
wanted it they should have told us and
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
we would have been happy to comply so I
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of take your point but um not all
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
501c3 charitable organizations are as
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
blessed as yours Wass that have all
 
04:30:49.710 --> 04:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
these pro bono
 
04:30:54.229 --> 04:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
people this is if the tone of this
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
sounds what defiant I really don't mean
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
it to be that I want us to be good
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
citizens the town officials want to be a
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
good citizen too I mean Kingston's a
 
04:31:07.229 --> 04:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful place especially after they
 
04:31:09.870 --> 04:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
refunded my tax bill and we're just
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
trying to set some some
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
encouragements in different
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
directions short follow followup yes
 
04:31:22.990 --> 04:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
what about posting legal notice in a
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
publication instead of having to I mean
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine there's hundreds of
 
04:31:31.950 --> 04:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
organizations within a community that
 
04:31:36.550 --> 04:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
would you know have to receive a mailing
 
04:31:39.990 --> 04:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
but what about posting notice instead of
 
04:31:43.469 --> 04:31:43.479 align:start position:0%
having to do a mailing of a letter at at
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
the expense at that expense our
 
04:31:48.670 --> 04:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful County newspaper folded last
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
year okay um we didn't know we had to do
 
04:31:58.070 --> 04:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
a few other things and um secretary
 
04:32:00.710 --> 04:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
Garder and I had nice little chat and
 
04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
our friends over to charitable trust
 
04:32:04.550 --> 04:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
which by the way is a wonderful
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
organization to deal with because they
 
04:32:08.750 --> 04:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
just want to get the stuff done right
 
04:32:12.389 --> 04:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
they're not out for blood and uh I think
 
04:32:14.469 --> 04:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
the best quote I receiv received from
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
Diane quinland retired head of
 
04:32:18.910 --> 04:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
charitable trust
 
04:32:22.389 --> 04:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
was Sir we deal with people like you a
 
04:32:25.630 --> 04:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
lot I took that as a compliment and I
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
think it was meant as one they were very
 
04:32:30.109 --> 04:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
helpful but yeah we're
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
learning thank you you're
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you for taking my question
 
04:32:42.790 --> 04:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
um how how would a municipality
 
04:32:46.830 --> 04:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
um be alerted to a
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
nonprofit being in town initially yes so
 
04:32:55.550 --> 04:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
um you know a nonprofit moves into town
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
um how how does how did the assessors
 
04:33:01.950 --> 04:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
know that they have set up shop there
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
that's when just about everybody myself
 
04:33:07.869 --> 04:33:07.879 align:start position:0%
included would have a lawyer helping you
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
do the paperwork do it with the state
 
04:33:13.470 --> 04:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
what is required who to notify and so on
 
04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did when we set it up
 
04:33:18.910 --> 04:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
is we had a lawyer do that work for us
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
um most of the charitable organizations
 
04:33:25.830 --> 04:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
in what I like to call metropolit in
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
Kingston um have done that when they
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
started um what we're referring to here
 
04:33:37.150 --> 04:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
is mostly the annual update stuff where
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer follow up
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I guess what I'm trying to
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
refer to is similar um to representative
 
04:33:51.230 --> 04:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
Alward is
 
04:33:53.551 --> 04:33:53.561 align:start position:0%
accountability it it feels like the
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
accountability is all being placed onto
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
the municipality are onto the assessing
 
04:34:03.269 --> 04:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
office um
 
04:34:05.789 --> 04:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
when I'm and I'm trying to figure out
 
04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
you know as a select person how this
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
would work in my community right how
 
04:34:12.070 --> 04:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
would I how would I protect myself uh in
 
04:34:14.429 --> 04:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
the town I would say well we should send
 
04:34:17.310 --> 04:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
these out certified mail well we just
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
put together a a bill that would you
 
04:34:22.109 --> 04:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
know incent it off to the house that
 
04:34:26.429 --> 04:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
would reimburse a municipality that cost
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
um for certified mail so I guess I'm
 
04:34:30.189 --> 04:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
just I'm trying to understand where the
 
04:34:33.551 --> 04:34:33.561 align:start position:0%
accountability is I think it's mutual
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
and I think the tone of a charitable
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
organization in a town whose leaders are
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
people of Goodwill is that there wants
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
to be a mutuality there this I do not
 
04:34:49.830 --> 04:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
see this as a judical thing
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
primarily the attitude is Friends
 
04:34:52.920 --> 04:34:53.869 align:start position:0%
primarily the attitude is Friends
helping

04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
helping
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
friends um I just received four because
 
04:34:59.709 --> 04:34:59.719 align:start position:0%
I'm chairman of the board of four 501
 
04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
c3s and I just received four separate
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
letters from the Secretary of State
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
saying such and such a report is due no
 
04:35:09.910 --> 04:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
later than December 31st of this year in
 
04:35:12.510 --> 04:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
our office thank you sir
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
photocopies all over the place in case I
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
lose the original stickies on the wall
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
and so on but I can't guarantee I would
 
04:35:22.349 --> 04:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
have thought to do that so I appreciate
 
04:35:25.470 --> 04:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
it it is really asking friends to be
 
04:35:28.269 --> 04:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
friends so we can be friends too that's
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
that's just what I want and most of the
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
time Kingston did
 
04:35:34.750 --> 04:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
that and the one year they didn't they
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
called me and
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
said the second time that happened
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
several years later I got a tax bill
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
which they they were funded and nobody
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
got angry we all sort of took a deep
 
04:35:48.990 --> 04:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
breath and realized in the aftermath of
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
this law suit maybe there's been a
 
04:35:51.000 --> 04:35:52.429 align:start position:0%
this law suit maybe there's been a
little

04:35:52.429 --> 04:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:35:54.269 --> 04:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
overreach and I'm not going to say
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether there was or not I'm just going
 
04:35:57.949 --> 04:35:57.959 align:start position:0%
to say let's let's go back to the
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
Friends being friends like we used to
 
04:36:03.070 --> 04:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
have only get something down on
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
paper further
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
grundt thank you madam chairwoman thank
 
04:36:13.629 --> 04:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um in the
 
04:36:16.510 --> 04:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
original Bill your last line 11 and well
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
11 and 12 so last two lines second last
 
04:36:22.349 --> 04:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
says but no so no such application shall
 
04:36:24.629 --> 04:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
be received or exemption granted after
 
04:36:26.390 --> 04:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
the local tax rate has been approved for
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
that year your Amendment does not have
 
04:36:31.709 --> 04:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
that in there that's right because if
 
04:36:32.869 --> 04:36:32.879 align:start position:0%
they're really
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
late in getting a notification to
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
us and I'm scrambling around say say oh
 
04:36:42.429 --> 04:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
my gosh we're late we're late we're late
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
and their response is too late that kind
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
of takes out the whole purpose of having
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
you got to send us a letter
 
04:36:53.029 --> 04:36:53.039 align:start position:0%
please so there's an incentive
 
04:36:57.310 --> 04:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
there um we didn't get our tax bill this
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
past year until well after the tax
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
deadline but when we sat down together
 
04:37:05.470 --> 04:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
as friends being friends they realized
 
04:37:08.269 --> 04:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
okay we'll give you your money back we
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
should have you should have don't do it
 
04:37:12.910 --> 04:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
again which believe me with the stickies
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
in my office we're not going to do this
 
04:37:17.789 --> 04:37:17.799 align:start position:0%
again but that's the thing is if if you
 
04:37:19.789 --> 04:37:19.799 align:start position:0%
miss something you miss something up
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
here we can't be
 
04:37:26.269 --> 04:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
penalized and when your T the tax you
 
04:37:29.709 --> 04:37:29.719 align:start position:0%
know we spend $8,000 on our tax bill I
 
04:37:31.949 --> 04:37:31.959 align:start position:0%
don't know what minuscule percentage
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
that is in the budget of the town of
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
Kingston but you got to have a bunch of
 
04:37:38.150 --> 04:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
zeros after the decimal before you get a
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
crooked number so even if it's after the
 
04:37:43.470 --> 04:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
tax rate with it will not in any way
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:52.830 --> 04:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Gilman is recognized
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam chair and
 
04:37:58.109 --> 04:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um the
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
original bill has a fiscal note and so
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
the amendment also has a fiscal note and
 
04:38:07.150 --> 04:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
note which I would say so there there's
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's anything you know
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
in my experience with dealing with FNS I
 
04:38:17.551 --> 04:38:17.561 align:start position:0%
I don't see that there was anything
 
04:38:20.189 --> 04:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
materially different other than a
 
04:38:23.230 --> 04:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
cleaning up of deadline language in the
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that would make a
 
04:38:29.551 --> 04:38:29.561 align:start position:0%
difference followup Madam chair yes okay
 
04:38:32.551 --> 04:38:32.561 align:start position:0%
so the amount of money that's uh that's
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
talked about in here is for just the one
 
04:38:39.551 --> 04:38:39.561 align:start position:0%
example or for the
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
state is that state income tax that
 
04:38:45.869 --> 04:38:45.879 align:start position:0%
that's uh not
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
being well the fiscal impact is less
 
04:38:51.709 --> 04:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
than 10,000 of
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
what yeah it's probably the cost of a
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
postage stamp to send us the letter
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
which has not yet exceeded $10,000 but
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's on the way thank you thank
 
04:39:07.070 --> 04:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
you for other
 
04:39:09.269 --> 04:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you committee
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.150 --> 04:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
Misha good afternoon again committee
 
04:39:28.349 --> 04:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
members Madam chair Jim Mish show town
 
04:39:30.750 --> 04:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
of Hudson I do have written testimony on
 
04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and I can only go based upon
 
04:39:35.869 --> 04:39:35.879 align:start position:0%
the bill that was uh that was that was
 
04:39:38.190 --> 04:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
before today I don't have the amendment
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so you know I read a bill literally
 
04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
like what the words say so this bill
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
proposes to put the veritable cart
 
04:39:47.470 --> 04:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
before the horse this bill would require
 
04:39:49.628 --> 04:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities to annually mail lines 4
 
04:39:52.510 --> 04:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
through 5 a form to all organizations
 
04:39:54.550 --> 04:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
and entities exempt from property
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
taxation within the community but how do
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
we know which Comm which
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
organizations would be exempt it's an
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
unknown we know what the prior years was
 
04:40:06.430 --> 04:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
so if the intent was for the community
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
to mail it out to those entities that
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
got it in the prior
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
year we could do that um Hudson
 
04:40:16.270 --> 04:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
voluntarily does that uh January is we
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
would have done it by now but BT Board
 
04:40:19.868 --> 04:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
of tax land appeals is redoing their
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
forms A9 and a12 in part because of
 
04:40:25.150 --> 04:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
legislation from last year um
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
introducing accident mistake Misfortune
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh for a12 um
 
04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
so uh number two um what is a form if
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
the form being reference is the btla
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
form um as called for an RSA 7223 C
 
04:40:41.948 --> 04:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
annual list
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
then maybe the legislation should say
 
04:40:46.470 --> 04:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
the form that the board of tax and land
 
04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
appeals sends out you know and 7223 C
 
04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
the form should be described right in
 
04:40:54.510 --> 04:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
some manner or referen to some state
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
agency that's responsible for doing the
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:04.110 --> 04:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
um so further line four says all
 
04:41:06.430 --> 04:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
organizations exempt under this section
 
04:41:08.230 --> 04:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
so that would be all the governmental
 
04:41:09.990 --> 04:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
organizations the ones that don't even
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
have to apply have to get the full form
 
04:41:14.590 --> 04:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way the proposal reads the
 
04:41:17.150 --> 04:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
counties The Village districts State
 
04:41:19.910 --> 04:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
University probably not intended that's
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:26.070 --> 04:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
reads uh the proposal in line six states
 
04:41:28.350 --> 04:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
to send the form out by April 1st with a
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
deadline of April 15th that's probably
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
not enough time probably should have the
 
04:41:35.628 --> 04:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
community send it out a lot maybe two
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
months before April 15th um again in
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
Hudson we typically send it out in
 
04:41:40.240 --> 04:41:44.230 align:start position:0%
Hudson we typically send it out in
January

04:41:44.230 --> 04:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
um even though we do send that form out
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
we still don't get things timely so we
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
send the form out again way before the
 
04:41:53.070 --> 04:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
deadline then we send out a certified
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
mail again that's our choice right as
 
04:41:56.628 --> 04:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
municipality you can choose to do that
 
04:41:58.230 --> 04:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
versus legislation that requires you to
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
spend the money um and the certified
 
04:42:04.590 --> 04:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
mail usually does um get get the
 
04:42:06.510 --> 04:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
person's attention we also use thing
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
called phone you know we call people up
 
04:42:12.750 --> 04:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
um let's see lines 5 through eight the
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
form shall note all documents that must
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
be submitted to the city of town by the
 
04:42:18.390 --> 04:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
organization entity to establish
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility um so form A9 um does
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
contain uh information that it asks for
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
the form literally says organizational
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
documents nature of membership functions
 
04:42:33.270 --> 04:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
property and the nature of the property
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
such of information as shouldas
 
04:42:36.750 --> 04:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
reasonably required so there is a
 
04:42:38.830 --> 04:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
description of the forms on the btla
 
04:42:41.550 --> 04:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
form A9 in regards to the charal
 
04:42:43.628 --> 04:42:43.638 align:start position:0%
organizations btla form a12 and I've
 
04:42:46.270 --> 04:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
included all this um it describes the
 
04:42:49.670 --> 04:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
material needed um it says uh must file
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
a statements of his financial condition
 
04:42:54.070 --> 04:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh statement is due annually before June
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
1st um says include the IRS form 990 I
 
04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
mean all this information is given to
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:07.750 --> 04:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
form so um in addition to that the btla
 
04:43:10.708 --> 04:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
has gone through a number of communities
 
04:43:13.030 --> 04:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
and um you know really investigating
 
04:43:14.510 --> 04:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not entities are getting
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
exemptions which they're not qualified
 
04:43:18.750 --> 04:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
for um in the course of that and that's
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
the next to last paragraph my second
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
page the btla has developed a checklist
 
04:43:26.350 --> 04:43:26.360 align:start position:0%
of documents that communities uh should
 
04:43:29.230 --> 04:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
take a look at and request so maybe that
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
should be formalized in the statute or
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
maybe the btla should be encouraged to
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
formalize that on the A9 or a12 um
 
04:43:39.070 --> 04:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's kind of an ad hoc thing from the
 
04:43:39.080 --> 04:43:41.868 align:start position:0%
that's kind of an ad hoc thing from the
btla

04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
btla
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
communities are are following the law
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
the way it's written um I don't know
 
04:43:49.590 --> 04:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
about days gone by when law didn't exist
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to follow the law we're
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
being held accountable by the judicial
 
04:43:59.430 --> 04:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
system to follow the law so um I I don't
 
04:44:00.910 --> 04:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
know about you know we can just forgive
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
deadlines and stuff that would be called
 
04:44:05.230 --> 04:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
not following the law and if I go to BT
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
and say that they're going to laugh at
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
me as they should follow the law follow
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
the deadlines um other than that I I can
 
04:44:14.230 --> 04:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:39.230 --> 04:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:42.430 --> 04:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
you that was a last pink card that I had
 
04:44:44.910 --> 04:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
so I will ask right now is there anyone
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
present who wishes to speak on the bill
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
who has not yet had the opportunity to
 
04:44:49.600 --> 04:44:57.310 align:start position:0%
who has not yet had the opportunity to
do

04:44:57.310 --> 04:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:06.990 --> 04:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
um so why don't you provide your
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
testimony and then you can fill that
 
04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:15.628 --> 04:45:15.638 align:start position:0%
welcome to Municipal and County
 
04:45:26.110 --> 04:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.510 --> 04:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much um I experienced
 
04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
the need for this last year because
 
04:45:37.230 --> 04:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
excuse me excuse me I'm sorry is this
 
04:45:40.350 --> 04:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
representative gay gay gay well I'm just
 
04:45:44.110 --> 04:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
honorable now okay so Betty gay from
 
04:45:47.628 --> 04:45:47.638 align:start position:0%
Salem and uh we experienced the need for
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
this just this past year because we
 
04:45:52.320 --> 04:45:53.430 align:start position:0%
this just this past year because we
learned

04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
learned
 
04:45:53.440 --> 04:45:55.310 align:start position:0%
learned
about

04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:45:57.190 --> 04:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
04:46:02.910 --> 04:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
see okay our churches and other um other
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations like American
 
04:46:08.070 --> 04:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
legent had never been taxed before on
 
04:46:08.080 --> 04:46:09.110 align:start position:0%
legent had never been taxed before on
their

04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:46:14.070 --> 04:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
property and some of them had new
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
leadership so that the new people didn't
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
know about the forms that you have to
 
04:46:22.910 --> 04:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
submit by I think there are two forms I
 
04:46:25.230 --> 04:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
haven't had to fill them out myself so
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember one of them is by
 
04:46:31.548 --> 04:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
the is in April and one is in June so
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
these new people didn't know about the
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
forms and then the churches also had
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
never had some had an assessor come and
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
walk their property and decide whether
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
every square foot was used for church
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
purposes and when they got the tax bills
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
they were pretty late in the year pretty
 
04:46:57.190 --> 04:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
soon pretty close just a couple of
 
04:47:00.270 --> 04:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
months from the time that the tax uh
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
rate was going to be set because once
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
the tax rate is set you cannot do
 
04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
anything but pay the tax and then appeal
 
04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
and so what the churches did
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
somehow they came up with several
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar paid the tax and then
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
luckily in our town the council agreed
 
04:47:22.110 --> 04:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
that was not appropriate and they did
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
get the money back but I don't know how
 
04:47:27.430 --> 04:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
many churches could do that just write a
 
04:47:28.750 --> 04:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
check for
 
04:47:32.190 --> 04:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
$68,000 or more and uh then wait to get
 
04:47:36.910 --> 04:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
it back so we learned a couple of things
 
04:47:40.510 --> 04:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
that were disturbing one is that if you
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
had a new organization or somebody the
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
person who' been commander of the
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
American Legion had finally retired so
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
he probably took care of it all the time
 
04:47:51.868 --> 04:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
new Commander didn't know anything about
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
it so here they were told that they owed
 
04:47:56.110 --> 04:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
all his
 
04:47:59.470 --> 04:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
tax then the churches had never been
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
taxed before on their
 
04:48:06.030 --> 04:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
property and uh some were afraid if
 
04:48:09.030 --> 04:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
since they only got charged
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
$100 they didn't want to say anything
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
because they were afraid they'd go
 
04:48:15.390 --> 04:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
realize they had several more Acres of
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
property that they might raise the tax
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
on others
 
04:48:23.470 --> 04:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
said well we didn't get taxed because
 
04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
part of our property is a memorial
 
04:48:28.548 --> 04:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
garden and that's considered a a
 
04:48:30.670 --> 04:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
cemetery so we didn't get taxed so we'll
 
04:48:33.030 --> 04:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
just pretend it's not happening cuz we
 
04:48:36.548 --> 04:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
let out then the church right next door
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
has a lot of wetlands a lot of
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
trees several
 
04:48:44.510 --> 04:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
Acres they got
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
hammered and we couldn't even believe
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
that the church that got just $100 of
 
04:48:54.708 --> 04:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
tax they were being taxed on their
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
Wetland their
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
trees then another church the minister
 
04:49:02.030 --> 04:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
walked around with the assessor who's
 
04:49:04.548 --> 04:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
saying well what do you use this for
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
well they actually in the woods they had
 
04:49:09.788 --> 04:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
a path so he could say well we'll use
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
that they says what do you use the grass
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
for there was a playground on that gr
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
exuse me honorable representative gay so
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
I I hear that you're providing testimony
 
04:49:26.230 --> 04:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
on um assessing and not notification
 
04:49:28.830 --> 04:49:28.840 align:start position:0%
could you could you get back to that
 
04:49:31.510 --> 04:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay well the important thing was nobody
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
would have gotten trapped if they had
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
been notified that they needed to submit
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
the papers the two documents on one time
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
so this way if the if the town is
 
04:49:47.830 --> 04:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
obligated to send it then that won't
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
happen again and uh the the other issue
 
04:49:54.190 --> 04:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
about paying taxes is of course in in
 
04:49:57.070 --> 04:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
other bills so I apologize for wandering
 
04:50:00.910 --> 04:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:04.270 --> 04:50:04.280 align:start position:0%

04:50:18.350 --> 04:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
so I do believe that was the final
 
04:50:20.430 --> 04:50:20.440 align:start position:0%

04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Gilman to
 
04:50:27.390 --> 04:50:27.400 align:start position:0%

Chief assessor for the town of Hudson I
 
04:53:54.190 --> 04:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
do have written uh testimony um in
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
regards to the first section first
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
section requiring municipalities to post
 
04:54:01.628 --> 04:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
instructions on how to apply um so there
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
already is an RSA RSA 76 colon 11 that
 
04:54:07.788 --> 04:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
speaks to notice of property tax relief
 
04:54:10.830 --> 04:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
programs I've attached that law and that
 
04:54:13.270 --> 04:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
requires us to print on the taxx bill
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
stated language right the statutory
 
04:54:16.910 --> 04:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
language that talks about exemption
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
programs for them to apply for tax
 
04:54:22.750 --> 04:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
credits um so in in semiannual tax bill
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
communities uh folks receive it directly
 
04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
from by first class mail right US Post
 
04:54:30.430 --> 04:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
Office so um in addition to that between
 
04:54:33.788 --> 04:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
web pages uh people's uh Community media
 
04:54:36.750 --> 04:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
cable uh the newspaper um there's a lot
 
04:54:39.070 --> 04:54:39.080 align:start position:0%
of notification about tax relief
 
04:54:43.230 --> 04:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
programs um so I think that it's outside
 
04:54:45.070 --> 04:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
of handl it to people at their front
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
door as opposed to using the post office
 
04:54:48.868 --> 04:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
I think there already is quite a bit of
 
04:54:50.830 --> 04:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
notification about the awareness of
 
04:54:55.230 --> 04:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
these programs um in regards to um
 
04:54:57.910 --> 04:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
sections 3 four and five disabled deaf
 
04:55:00.430 --> 04:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
and elderly um seeks to raise the
 
04:55:03.310 --> 04:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
optional disabled exemption amounts um
 
04:55:06.030 --> 04:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
so sorry the asset amounts um I've
 
04:55:08.708 --> 04:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
listed on the last paragraph of page one
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
um there's about 111 communities that
 
04:55:12.430 --> 04:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
have the disabled exemption that's an
 
04:55:14.190 --> 04:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
optional exemption um you're not
 
04:55:16.510 --> 04:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
required to adopt it uh the asset range
 
04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
is 35,000 to 500,000 the median asset
 
04:55:21.948 --> 04:55:21.958 align:start position:0%
limit is 65 the average asset amount is
 
04:55:21.958 --> 04:55:42.750 align:start position:0%
limit is 65 the average asset amount is
93,471

04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.948 --> 04:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
in regards to um tying the asset amounts
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
or exemption amounts uh to an automatic
 
04:55:51.708 --> 04:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
CPI index that's new right so that's we
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
don't have that in law um someone can
 
04:55:56.270 --> 04:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
make an argument that uh tying it in
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
automatically removes the will of the
 
04:56:00.628 --> 04:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
voters right I mean if we want to raise
 
04:56:02.590 --> 04:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
the amount then voters have a choice to
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
do that and uh you know selectman former
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
government um so having an automatic
 
04:56:11.070 --> 04:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
escalator um you could say takes away
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
the will of the voters maybe that maybe
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
they want to have that decision
 
04:56:17.910 --> 04:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
themselves uh sections 7 through 13
 
04:56:20.750 --> 04:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
involve State program no comment on that
 
04:56:22.750 --> 04:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
and uh sections 14 through 15 a
 
04:56:24.670 --> 04:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
far-reaching study commission appears
 
04:56:26.670 --> 04:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
that there's uh fairly significant
 
04:56:28.350 --> 04:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal stakeholder and other
 
04:56:30.150 --> 04:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners involvement uh that would
 
04:56:32.350 --> 04:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
be contemplated so that's the extent of
 
04:56:32.360 --> 04:56:32.990 align:start position:0%
be contemplated so that's the extent of
my

04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:56:37.350 --> 04:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
comments thank you for your testimony
 
04:56:40.670 --> 04:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative Colby
 
04:56:41.948 --> 04:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just looking for
 
04:56:46.948 --> 04:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
a recommendation um multiple times
 
04:56:51.190 --> 04:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
within the bill it it states um an
 
04:56:53.310 --> 04:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
amount not less than which shall be
 
04:56:55.270 --> 04:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation annually based
 
04:56:56.830 --> 04:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
upon the Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index Northeast region it
 
04:57:00.990 --> 04:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us a date would you have a
 
04:57:03.990 --> 04:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
date that you would suggest
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
that um you could say the last prior
 
04:57:09.310 --> 04:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
quarter right or the last prior annual
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay um if that something that that the
 
04:57:13.708 --> 04:57:13.718 align:start position:0%
committee feels should have that in
 
04:57:16.830 --> 04:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
there um you know just annually the
 
04:57:19.030 --> 04:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
community would need to make sure it did
 
04:57:21.030 --> 04:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
that right so I would have to plug it
 
04:57:23.310 --> 04:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
into the mass appraisal system tax has
 
04:57:26.270 --> 04:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
to have it in their system um we we
 
04:57:27.948 --> 04:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
would do it right so we're required to
 
04:57:29.590 --> 04:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
do it but that's a good good comment
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's actually in my written testimony
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
I didn't know what time period that CPI
 
04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
was going to grab from and should every
 
04:57:38.190 --> 04:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
Community um for the ease of assessing
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
purposes and and the Department of
 
04:57:44.190 --> 04:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration adopt the same
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
day I imagine that if the proposal was
 
04:57:50.670 --> 04:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
had the specification added it would be
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
the same specification for each
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
community that chose to adopt the
 
04:57:55.750 --> 04:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
exemption would be that same specified
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
you representative Guthrie is recognized
 
04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you madam chairman
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
04:58:13.830 --> 04:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned the uh in adjusted for
 
04:58:16.830 --> 04:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
inflation that that was the problem uh
 
04:58:20.470 --> 04:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
would you would I be correct in saying
 
04:58:24.030 --> 04:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
that when the adjustment was made to
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
increase the the original increase
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't that be part of the warrant
 
04:58:32.190 --> 04:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
article that that in the warrant article
 
04:58:34.270 --> 04:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
it would say that the adjustment would
 
04:58:37.270 --> 04:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
be made couldn't you do it that way
 
04:58:38.670 --> 04:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative if I understand the
 
04:58:40.680 --> 04:58:42.990 align:start position:0%
representative if I understand the
question

04:58:42.990 --> 04:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
correctly you'd have to have an annual
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
under current law you'd have to have an
 
04:58:51.270 --> 04:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
annual warrant article to establish what
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
the asset amount should
 
04:58:56.670 --> 04:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
be there is no provision currently this
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
is proposing to add a provision but
 
04:59:01.990 --> 04:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's no provision currently for that
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
just to be an
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
automatic increase in the asset amount
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
based upon some Metric it would be
 
04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
outside the bounds of current law a
 
04:59:11.868 --> 04:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
community were to do that in such a
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
formal Fashion on a Warren article I
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
know if I may I know Town Council
 
04:59:19.190 --> 04:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
communities that say each year this is
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do but each year
 
04:59:24.670 --> 04:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
they make they they vote on that new
 
04:59:27.470 --> 04:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
number so there's an annual election to
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
do that am I not follow up mam CH
 
04:59:37.230 --> 04:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
so the legislative body couldn't just
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
say in the Warren article that we're
 
04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
going to adjust this every
 
04:59:45.430 --> 04:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
year don't you don't think that would
 
04:59:47.990 --> 04:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
pass buer I I don't think that the
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
current language allows for it and since
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're a Dylan rule state municipalities
 
04:59:53.948 --> 04:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
can only do what the legislature allows
 
04:59:56.350 --> 04:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
us to do and I don't see anywhere in the
 
04:59:58.430 --> 04:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that says you can do this
 
05:00:00.990 --> 05:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
automatic it just does it on its own
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
unless this were to pass this this
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:11.590 --> 05:00:11.600 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:00:15.510 --> 05:00:15.520 align:start position:0%

05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Guthrie's
 
05:00:17.958 --> 05:00:20.110 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Guthrie's
question

05:00:20.110 --> 05:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:00:24.190 --> 05:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
um in well sb2 town anyway we need to
 
05:00:26.350 --> 05:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
give the number that we're raising an
 
05:00:26.360 --> 05:00:27.910 align:start position:0%
give the number that we're raising an
appropriating

05:00:27.910 --> 05:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
appropriating
 
05:00:31.230 --> 05:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
so if the if it's
 
05:00:34.708 --> 05:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
50,000 plus must plus or minus the
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index then um we don't
 
05:00:40.830 --> 05:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
know what that appropriation will be in
 
05:00:40.840 --> 05:00:42.270 align:start position:0%
know what that appropriation will be in
subsequent

05:00:42.270 --> 05:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
subsequent
 
05:00:44.990 --> 05:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
years is that is that problem thank you

for the thank you for the question I I
 
05:00:48.110 --> 05:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
don't really I don't believe it's an
 
05:00:50.230 --> 05:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation of money it's a
 
05:00:52.510 --> 05:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
description of the exemption amount or
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%

thank you for the
 
05:01:17.670 --> 05:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
question this this would uh this would
 
05:01:20.990 --> 05:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
seem to override the local
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
authorities approach to raising or
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
adjusting how much that exemption amount
 
05:01:25.600 --> 05:01:28.868 align:start position:0%
adjusting how much that exemption amount
should

05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%

05:13:32.750 --> 05:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
better good afternoon I'm Steve Tower
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney at New Hampshire Legal
 
05:13:36.628 --> 05:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
Assistant I uh lead our local welfare
 
05:13:39.868 --> 05:13:39.878 align:start position:0%
project um I had email Ed representative
 
05:13:45.070 --> 05:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
Roy about this bill uh earlier on and um
 
05:13:46.830 --> 05:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
I had assumed that the intention of this
 
05:13:48.470 --> 05:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill was to prevent undocumented
 
05:13:50.430 --> 05:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
immigrants from accessing local welfare
 
05:13:52.670 --> 05:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
and and and that that was a major
 
05:13:57.150 --> 05:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
concern and I uh I wanted to point out
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
that existing federal law which I'm
 
05:14:04.430 --> 05:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
circulating around prohibits um most uh
 
05:14:06.430 --> 05:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
immigrants particularly undocumented
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
immigrants from accessing any state
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
benefits um the exceptions are for
 
05:14:14.830 --> 05:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
qualified aliens under federal law or
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
certain types of nonimmigrant aliens um
 
05:14:22.150 --> 05:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
and in those instances States may allow
 
05:14:24.670 --> 05:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
them to receive access to state benefits
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
but they may also restrict access to
 
05:14:30.910 --> 05:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
state benefits um now representative
 
05:14:34.030 --> 05:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
Roy's bill would limit access to local
 
05:14:36.628 --> 05:14:36.638 align:start position:0%
welfare for just US citizens and
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
permanent residents but under federal
 
05:14:42.510 --> 05:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
law as I'm circulating around uh uh
 
05:14:46.990 --> 05:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
chapter 8 USC sections I believe it's
 
05:14:51.310 --> 05:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
1622 um there is a list of exceptions
 
05:14:55.110 --> 05:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
that a state must allow to access state
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
benefits and those exceptions include
 
05:15:00.350 --> 05:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
people who are approved as Asylum
 
05:15:02.750 --> 05:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
Seekers uh for the first five years that
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
they are granted Asylum people who are
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
approved as refugees for the first 5
 
05:15:08.708 --> 05:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
years and and so that's required by
 
05:15:13.548 --> 05:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
federal law um in the draft as
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
provided uh these number of exceptions
 
05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
which also include uh aliens that have
 
05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
served in the US military or are
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
currently in active duty in the US
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
military States also must allow them
 
05:15:29.350 --> 05:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
access to state benefits um these are
 
05:15:31.548 --> 05:15:31.558 align:start position:0%
not currently included in the law so to
 
05:15:34.270 --> 05:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
the bill so to comply with federal law
 
05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
the bill would at least need to include
 
05:15:38.590 --> 05:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
those enumerated exceptions that are in
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
8 USC section
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
1622 um and if you look at it it's it's
 
05:15:47.830 --> 05:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a long and lengthy set of except
 
05:15:50.110 --> 05:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
exceptions that refer to certain
 
05:15:51.628 --> 05:15:51.638 align:start position:0%
sections of the immigration and
 
05:15:56.708 --> 05:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
nationality act um and uh if if you were
 
05:15:59.548 --> 05:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
to include all of these listed out
 
05:16:01.990 --> 05:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions in the local Welfare Law it's
 
05:16:02.000 --> 05:16:02.628 align:start position:0%
exceptions in the local Welfare Law it's
going

05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:16:06.750 --> 05:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
to be fairly complicated to look at and
 
05:16:09.990 --> 05:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
read I'll note um the local welfare
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
administrators Association puts out
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
model rules and guidelines for towns to
 
05:16:18.030 --> 05:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
adopt and in the the guidelines they do
 
05:16:20.830 --> 05:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
include a section about the eligibility
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
for uh non-citizens that summarizes the
 
05:16:26.350 --> 05:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
federal requirements that I've
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
circulated around um so that is
 
05:16:32.270 --> 05:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
currently in the guidelines for uh the
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
recommended guidelines for
 
05:16:34.080 --> 05:16:36.070 align:start position:0%
recommended guidelines for
towns

05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
towns
 
05:16:39.990 --> 05:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
um there are also two categories of
 
05:16:43.910 --> 05:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
individuals which a state may deny local
 
05:16:45.628 --> 05:16:45.638 align:start position:0%
welfare benefits to or or any other
 
05:16:49.430 --> 05:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
state benefit to that uh while a state
 
05:16:52.990 --> 05:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
may deny access to those two groups um
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
for uh humanitarian and Law and Order
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
reasons I I would ask this committee to
 
05:17:00.510 --> 05:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
consider including those as allowable to
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
receive local welfare benefits those are
 
05:17:07.750 --> 05:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
people who are defined under uh uh 8 USC
 
05:17:09.390 --> 05:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh section
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
1101 part 15 T and U as you can see
 
05:17:16.670 --> 05:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
federal laws gets a little complicated
 
05:17:17.910 --> 05:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about immigration
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
but tnu refer to uh people who are
 
05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
eligible for visas because they are a
 
05:17:25.948 --> 05:17:25.958 align:start position:0%
victim of human trafficking or other
 
05:17:28.830 --> 05:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
serious crimes and are cooperating with
 
05:17:30.868 --> 05:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
authorities for the investigation or
 
05:17:32.910 --> 05:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
prosecution of the people who committed
 
05:17:35.510 --> 05:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
those crimes and where the US Attorney
 
05:17:37.230 --> 05:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
General's office has recognized that
 
05:17:39.670 --> 05:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
they are in fact doing that and are
 
05:17:42.510 --> 05:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for a Visa so that they can be
 
05:17:46.670 --> 05:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
available to go after those criminals um
 
05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
and I think it would undermine the
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
Federal Law and Order purpose of going
 
05:17:54.390 --> 05:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
after these criminals uh if a person
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
could obtain a visa to be here and and
 
05:18:01.510 --> 05:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
be available to help uh law enforcement
 
05:18:04.670 --> 05:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
go after these folks but then would have
 
05:18:07.390 --> 05:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
be denied the possibility of maintaining
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
basic survival LEL of care uh in the
 
05:18:14.590 --> 05:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
state um so I I I would ask that the at
 
05:18:16.510 --> 05:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
a minimum the committee try to include
 
05:18:17.708 --> 05:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
those to as
 
05:18:22.470 --> 05:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
eligible um but for the purposes of
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
clarity it may be more effective for
 
05:18:28.390 --> 05:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
this bill to be drafted to enumerate
 
05:18:31.070 --> 05:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
specifically which types of immigrants
 
05:18:34.430 --> 05:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh the committee wishes to prohibit from
 
05:18:37.350 --> 05:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
accessing local welfare say uh
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
immigrants who have no recogn legal
 
05:18:40.750 --> 05:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
status by the federal government or
 
05:18:43.230 --> 05:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
something like that it would be a nice
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
short addition into the RSA 165 statute
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
a eight paragraph inclusion of all these
 
05:18:56.350 --> 05:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
Federal exceptions under 8 USC
 
05:18:59.190 --> 05:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
1622 um but I think that's the extent of
 
05:19:00.990 --> 05:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
my testimony and I just wanted to point
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
out that there is some requirements in
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
federal law that are not currently
 
05:19:06.628 --> 05:19:06.638 align:start position:0%
included in this
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm happy to take questions
 
05:19:10.948 --> 05:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
I'll note that I am not an immigration
 
05:19:13.310 --> 05:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
expert by any stretch of the imagination
 
05:19:15.750 --> 05:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
I had not looked at any of this until I
 
05:19:18.670 --> 05:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
looked at this bill so uh I can do my
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
best to answer questions but um I may
 
05:19:23.430 --> 05:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
have to say that I don't know thank you
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
attorney Tower um the chair recognizes
 
05:19:29.350 --> 05:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy for a
 
05:19:32.150 --> 05:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
attorney um do you have the welfare
 
05:19:36.910 --> 05:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines for this committee so we can
 
05:19:40.390 --> 05:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
look at those um I did print out the one
 
05:19:42.230 --> 05:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
page and so these are the model
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines each town can adopt their own
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines um and the model guidelines
 
05:19:49.230 --> 05:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
are put together by the municipal
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
Association and the local welfare
 
05:19:52.990 --> 05:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
administrators Association as a
 
05:19:56.510 --> 05:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
recommended best practices to possibly
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
uh help towns avoid getting into any
 
05:20:01.310 --> 05:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
legal issues with bad unlawful
 
05:20:05.150 --> 05:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines um and so I did not bring a
 
05:20:07.030 --> 05:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
copy of those model guidelines I did
 
05:20:09.110 --> 05:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
bring the one page from the model
 
05:20:11.628 --> 05:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
guidelines that references eligibility
 
05:20:13.548 --> 05:20:13.558 align:start position:0%
for non-citizens and I can circulate
 
05:20:15.390 --> 05:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
that one page but I don't have the full
 
05:20:20.750 --> 05:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines with me thank you further
 
05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:30.670 --> 05:20:30.680 align:start position:0%

05:20:48.868 --> 05:20:48.878 align:start position:0%

of New England uh which is a refugee
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
resettlement and immigration support
 
05:21:13.350 --> 05:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
organization and we have been operating
 
05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
in Manchester since the early
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
1980s uh I wasn't planning actually on
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
speaking today but I did want to just
 
05:21:22.270 --> 05:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
add to the testimony that you've already
 
05:21:24.830 --> 05:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
heard including the written testimony uh
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm available for any questions uh I
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to emphasize one uh one
 
05:21:31.470 --> 05:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
point here and that is you've heard the
 
05:21:34.030 --> 05:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
legal rationale here and there's in in
 
05:21:36.590 --> 05:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
addition very good uh written testimony
 
05:21:39.150 --> 05:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
on the legal standards here but I wanted
 
05:21:41.830 --> 05:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
to address why the situation and why
 
05:21:45.150 --> 05:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
certain immigrants uh should be eligible
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
and are eligible under the federal law
 
05:21:49.628 --> 05:21:49.638 align:start position:0%
for this type of assistance um let me
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
talk about refugees and ases and by ases
 
05:21:53.628 --> 05:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
I mean people who have already been
 
05:21:56.470 --> 05:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
granted Asylum these are individuals who
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
have been lawfully admitted to the
 
05:21:59.548 --> 05:21:59.558 align:start position:0%
country they are fully authorized to
 
05:22:01.788 --> 05:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
work here they are fully authorized to
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
live here and they are on a path to uh
 
05:22:07.110 --> 05:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
permanent residence and citizenship from
 
05:22:08.830 --> 05:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
the time that they are here when a
 
05:22:10.510 --> 05:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
refugee comes to the country and by the
 
05:22:12.110 --> 05:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
way the refugees that come here are the
 
05:22:14.190 --> 05:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
most vetted immigrants who come into
 
05:22:16.270 --> 05:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
this country it can be up to a two-year
 
05:22:18.390 --> 05:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
process uh when they arrive in the
 
05:22:20.990 --> 05:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
United States they are then and when an
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
asylum Seeker is granted Asylum they are
 
05:22:25.948 --> 05:22:25.958 align:start position:0%
then uh required to apply for a green
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
card within one year that process can
 
05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
take up to three years for the
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
processing of the green card but they
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
are on a path to
 
05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship um for the most part the
 
05:22:39.470 --> 05:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
refugee program is been very successful
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it's quite rare that they are
 
05:22:44.030 --> 05:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
accessing this type of assistance but
 
05:22:45.910 --> 05:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are here for the most
 
05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
part they're working they are an active
 
05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
part of our society and as I say they
 
05:22:52.708 --> 05:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
are on a direct path to citizenship
 
05:22:54.670 --> 05:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
means that they should be able to take
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of those programs that provide
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
for the needy in our
 
05:23:03.750 --> 05:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
society thank you I I I don't want to
 
05:23:05.070 --> 05:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
take up any more of the committee's time
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
but I in some respects I am an
 
05:23:08.628 --> 05:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
immigration expert and I'm happy to take
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%

subcommittee
 
05:26:01.868 --> 05:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
meetings does anybody have any
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
questions yes yes thank you um does does
 
05:26:08.670 --> 05:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee have to report at the
 
05:26:11.868 --> 05:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
same time that the that the bill is due

05:26:27.788 --> 05:26:27.798 align:start position:0%
further inquiry with regards to the bill
 
05:26:29.470 --> 05:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
and then that information is brought
 
05:26:33.708 --> 05:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
forward to the entire committee um at
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
the executive session for input um and
 
05:26:37.200 --> 05:26:38.750 align:start position:0%
the executive session for input um and
