00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
the time being 9 30 i'd like to call the
 
00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
work session order and i would remind
 
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
everybody that while we are in here
 
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
assume that the mics are live
 
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh because it is going out um
 
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
so that people can watch us and see what
 
00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 align:start position:0%
what is going on
 
00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.190 align:start position:0%
what is going on
um

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
just a reminder there's been a couple of
 
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh gaffes in other committees
 
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
with people thinking that because they
 
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
were on a break that all the bikes were
 
00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
i will open the work session on house
 
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.670 align:start position:0%
i will open the work session on house

2022

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
we'll see what we get done today as i
 
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
said earlier
 
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
in one of our meetings
 
00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 align:start position:0%
it is my intention to do straw polls on
 
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
any proposed amendments i know that the
 
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner probably has brought
 
00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
they need to have included in it because
 
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
it will take a little bit of time before
 
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
an actual exact session next week to get
 
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
an amendment done
 
00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
but first we asked the commissioner and
 
00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 align:start position:0%
her department
 
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.790 align:start position:0%
her department
to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
bring us some additional information
 
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
to answer some questions that members
 
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
who are not here asked
 
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
but we will
 
00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
ask her to provide that information
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee it's good to be with you again
 
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of materials to pass out
 
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
today in response to some of the
 
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
and so i hope you'll bear with us as
 
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
we take up each item we'll pass out the
 
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
we take up each item we'll pass out the
materials

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
rather than giving you a stack of paper
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
all at one point
 
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
and because we know what happens people
 
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
start reading ahead and asking questions
 
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
or it can be confusing to understand
 
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
which document we're referencing um so
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman for providing us with the
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
couple of items that committee members
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
had elevated to you i think the first
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
request was for an acronyms list um
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
we talked about it last time when it
 
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
comes to the funding for transportation
 
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
it is a little bit of an
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
alphabet soup
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
so i think there had been
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
a list of acronyms in the back of one of
 
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
the early presentations but we have a
 
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
separate acronym list
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
definition sheet that we can pass out
 
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.229 align:start position:0%
definition sheet that we can pass out
today

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
and my thanks to glenn davison who's
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to be the one helping to pass that
 
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
out of the paper
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
and and just walk around and drop it you
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
know um
 
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
this is very informal and at every place
 
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
that there is a mic would probably be
 
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
and then at the last meeting we had a
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion around toll credits
 
00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 align:start position:0%
and specifically a request that came in
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
from the city of keene
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
so also with me today i'd spoken to
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
these documents but i have the original
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
email that i received from the city
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
from the city manager and then the
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
response that we provided from the
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
department so those can be passed out
 
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:24.550 align:start position:0%
department so those can be passed out
also

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
in terms the maps
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
for the section of highway as well as
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
to identify the locations of the sound
 
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
walls that we're installing so those can
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
so i believe those were
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
the items
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
um that weren't necessarily going to be
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
discussed today but we had follow-up to
 
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.350 align:start position:0%
discussed today but we had follow-up to
provide

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
documentation on
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
and then there was a number of other
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
we had been made aware that there might
 
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
be a request from the town of hudson
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
to perhaps
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
advocate that the hudson boulevard
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
project be reintroduced into the 10-year
 
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.310 align:start position:0%
project be reintroduced into the 10-year
plan

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
i did have a chance to talk with
 
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative ulri from hudson earlier
 
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
this week
 
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.469 align:start position:0%
this week
he

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
he and i talked through the history of
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
the project and we talked about
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
the various types of funding that are
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
available for transportation projects
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
but what would probably be the most
 
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.070 align:start position:0%
but what would probably be the most
suitable

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
suitable
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of funding uh work
 
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.830 align:start position:0%
in terms of funding uh work
um

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
this project you know
 
00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 align:start position:0%
and talking about it with him and i
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
shared this with the committee last time
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
hudson boulevard
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
would be constructed on a portion of
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
the right-of-way that was identified for
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
the old circumferential highway so the
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
department did construct a portion of
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
the circumferential really the sagamore
 
00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.350 align:start position:0%
the circumferential really the sagamore
bridge

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
between nashua and hudson but there had
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
been this vision to have a
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
highway that connected all the way up to
 
00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.550 align:start position:0%
highway that connected all the way up to
litchfield

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
litchfield
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
that project
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
we went through the environmental
 
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
permitting process
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
many years ago now and
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
the degree of impacts were such that the
 
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
project never moved forward beyond the
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
construction of the portions that the
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
department completed
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
a few years ago the town of hudson had
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
building a two-lane highway not a
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
four-lane highway as was originally
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
planned on a segment of the layout from
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
the circumferential and that's what they
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
were going to call hudson boulevard
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
the town had intended to pursue some
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
federal discretionary grants and so in a
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
previous 10-year plan
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
there was language introduced that
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
allowed the department to
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
work with the town
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
but our coordination would be limited to
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
reviewing the documents that they
 
00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.309 align:start position:0%
reviewing the documents that they
provided

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
and supporting them identifying the
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
design standards but the town would have
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
been responsible for actually advancing
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
the town did apply for grants they were
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful and so the project has
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
languished since
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
um but there still is concerns about the
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
degree of congestion on route 3a which
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
is low road in the town of hudson
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
and so there is interest in exploring
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know building another roadway that
 
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
you know building another roadway that
would

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
relieve some of that congestion
 
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
and make it easier for those traveling
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
both to hudson and within hudson
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
um so what representative already and i
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
talked about was perhaps a feasibility
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
study to go back and look at
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
why the circumference will never move
 
00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:37.350 align:start position:0%
why the circumference will never move
forward

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
look more closely at the proposed
 
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.629 align:start position:0%
look more closely at the proposed
alignment

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
alignment
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the original corridor and the
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
department had proposed an alternate
 
00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.909 align:start position:0%
department had proposed an alternate
alignment

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
alignment
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
at one point in time
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
and just try and figure out whether this
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
project truly is feasible and more
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
importantly what the actual design and
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
construction costs would be
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
um so we need a little bit more time as
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
i mentioned this was not a project that
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
was led by the department and we have
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
reached out to the town of hudson
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
and the town engineer has provided us
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
with all the information that he has
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
they hired a consultant to
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
scope the project and apply for the
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
grant funds
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
it also had the regional planning
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
commission and nashua rpc had done some
 
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.710 align:start position:0%
commission and nashua rpc had done some
work

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
um and so we now have all of that
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
material so we can estimate what it
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
would cost to complete a feasibility
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
study but we need a little bit more time
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
to do that this is all sort of coming
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
together in the last week or so
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude wise we're thinking
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
maybe as much as a million dollars
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
labor-intensive project from the
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
perspective of all the data we'd have to
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
collect you know what
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
stalled this project previously was the
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
environmental impact so we'd have to go
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
back and look closely at what went
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
delineation and
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
depending on how much work was done
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
by the town
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be trying to fill in those gaps to
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
understand whether a project really
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
could be undertaken
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
but we need some more time to refine
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of color of money to pay for
 
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
in terms of color of money to pay for
that

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
hudson boulevard if constructed really
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
would not serve the turnpike it would be
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
more of a local road
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
at this point we don't believe it would
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to fund it with turnpike
 
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.670 align:start position:0%
be appropriate to fund it with turnpike
revenues

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
and plus as you know we have
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
seen a reduction in turnpike revenues
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
which led to us delaying some of the
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
existing approved capital project work
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
um so we think it would be most
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate to look at federal funds for
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
this study um
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
and so we need some more time as well to
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
understand what the impact would be on
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
other projects in the 10-year plan
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
but we are going to try and get that
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
information pulled together by early
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
next week
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
and we did also explain that the
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
department is just estimating and
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
scoping a project
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the town of hudson
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
really has to make the request that this
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee consider any additions
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
and so we made them aware of the
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
continuation of the public hearing on
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
february 10th and also suggested that
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
once we have the information pulled
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
together concerning what they should be
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
asking for and that they submit
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
something in writing to the committee as
 
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.310 align:start position:0%
something in writing to the committee as
well

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative eaton
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner you said that this would be
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
a very labor-intensive project so if
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
they make the request if the funding
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
went in
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
does that slow down any of the projects
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
that we're currently looking at because
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
you've got limited resources we all know
 
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.190 align:start position:0%
you've got limited resources we all know
and

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
last gasp
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
throw them throw into the pool
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
um so this is some of the things that
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about internally we
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
likely would hire a consultant to
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
support us in advancing this effort um
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
we did think it would be prudent to
 
00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:48.389 align:start position:0%
we did think it would be prudent to
maybe

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
have some public informational meetings
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe some workshops with the town
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
before we would launch into the full
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
feasibility study um just to hear
 
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.310 align:start position:0%
feasibility study um just to hear
feedback

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
and understand what
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
really is the vision when it comes to
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
hudson boulevard
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
like i said this was not a d.o.t
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
initiated project it was something that
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
was town led
 
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.870 align:start position:0%
was town led
so

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
we might phase even the feasibility
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
study into a public engagement period
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then the data collection period and
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
then sort of recommendations and
 
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.949 align:start position:0%
then sort of recommendations and
suggested

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
um just so i'm clear uh trying to figure
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
out where we go from here on this issue
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
you will be bringing
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully in a week
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and then obviously if the town is
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
serious they'll they'll come in at the
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
continued public hearing and talk about
 
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.470 align:start position:0%
continued public hearing and talk about
it

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
what what i'm looking at is i'd hoped to
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
do the executive session that afternoon
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
but if we want to make changes i don't
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
actually getting finalized that
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
afternoon and we do have a continued uh
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
executive session done
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
but the the goal of the speaker and
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
myself is to finish with this by the end
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
of february
 
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.790 align:start position:0%
of february
um

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
we may not be able to include
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
this portion in that i'm just thinking
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
outside right now
 
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.430 align:start position:0%
outside right now
um

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
before that deadline to to get it done
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
and get it to the senate but then the
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
senate always says
 
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.230 align:start position:0%
senate always says
um

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.110 align:start position:0%
um
they're

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
their champion over there i'm sure but
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
again it's a zero-sum game so we'll be
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
looking forward to
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
whatever you and the
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
the town can bring in next week and then
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not we can incorporate
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
it into an amendment
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh to house bill 2022
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
that kind of the way the rest of the
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
yeah

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry uh so this is very
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
informal so we're in a work session so
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
just hit me upside the head if i don't
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
recognize you
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
so all we are really going to be
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
considering is the
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
quote the the million dollars for the
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
feasibility study we wouldn't be trying
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
to include this entire thing into the
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
10-year plan at this time
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
but as we keep saying
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's a zero-sum game a million dollars
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll be working with the town like i
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
said um and we'll
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
more formally um estimate the cost it'll
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
still be approximate given
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
um the level of information that we
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
currently have available
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
and then we'll work with the town to
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
make sure they officially
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
submit something to the committee for
 
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
submit something to the committee for
consideration

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
um so that was one of the follow-up
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
items um
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
i believe another topic that we wanted
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
to discuss today
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
resiliency and some of the new federal
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
funds that are available
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so pete in preparation had put
 
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.389 align:start position:0%
and so pete in preparation had put
together

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:15.509 align:start position:0%
together
um

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
do you want to present them
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
i'm so going to turn it over to pete to
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
walk you through a document that he has
 
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.350 align:start position:0%
walk you through a document that he has
prepared

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to say you know we spend a
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
lot of time talking about bridge and
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
pavement condition with this committee
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
we as a department over the last several
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
years have been trying to build out our
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
inventory for all the other
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
highway assets that we own and are
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
responsible for and
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
we've embarked on a significant effort
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
to not only have an inventory of all of
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
our culverts and closed drainage systems
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
but also to have frequent inspection and
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
condition ratings for those and so we're
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
well positioned as we talk about how to
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
best utilize the
 
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
best utilize the
funding

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
and that's dedicated to resiliency in
 
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:04.949 align:start position:0%
and that's dedicated to resiliency in
the

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
the new federal infrastructure bill and
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.750 align:start position:0%
good morning
um

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
so this one page summary um hopefully it
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
hits all the high points of the
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
items along with a a plan which is uh i
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
believe is consistent with how we've
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
approached um
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
some of the other new funding that we've
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
received uh as it's applied to the to
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
so the the new uh
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
program is called protect and that's
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
promoting resilient operations for
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
transformative and cost-saving
 
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.230 align:start position:0%
transformative and cost-saving
transportation

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
and again the purpose of that of that
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
program is to help states improve the
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
resiliency of transportation
 
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.470 align:start position:0%
resiliency of transportation
infrastructure

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
the funding um is uh like most other
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
funding is a 80 federal 20 match and
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
there is uh some language within the um
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
within the uh
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
the bill that would allow the match to
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
be reduced if you had
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
some um
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
developed a plan and implementation of a
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
resiliency improvement so um i think
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
we're on our on our way to
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
meeting those goals we're not there yet
 
00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:39.030 align:start position:0%
meeting those goals we're not there yet
but

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know this is the beginning of
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
our plan
 
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.509 align:start position:0%
our plan
[Music]

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
so it's formula funding and new
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
hampshire receives the annual
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
apportionment uh for this program and in
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
the first year of the reauthorization
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's 5.8 million dollars i believe in
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
2023 it's 5.9 million and change
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
there there is also um
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants that are associated
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
with this with this program
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
um and i've listed some of them here uh
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
resiliency improvement
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
community resilience and evacuation
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
routes and at-risk coastal
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and these again
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
are discretionary grants um that we'll
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
learn more about in the coming months we
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't know a whole lot about them at
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
and so our plan um for the additional
 
00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:36.150 align:start position:0%
and so our plan um for the additional
funding

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
um we increase our crdr program that's
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
the culvert replacement rehabilitation
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
and drainage repair so that's a program
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we have currently
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
in uh the 10-year plan it is also in in
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
the draft that you have and and
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
proposed to
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
include additional 2 million dollars
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
specifically from this protect
 
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.470 align:start position:0%
specifically from this protect
program

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
to bolster
 
00:18:03.919 --> 00:18:04.870 align:start position:0%
to bolster
that

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
culvert program so that we'd be able to
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
do more work
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
we know that there are lots of culverts
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
and this will assist in
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
helping to replace some of those
 
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.350 align:start position:0%
helping to replace some of those
culverts

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
culverts
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
i did provide a paragraph here under
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
number one that
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
explains what we've been doing over the
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
last couple of years to develop a
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
inventory a culvert inventory and a
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
drainage inventory statewide
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
and we've got it it's
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
right now we completed it
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
the end of the fall
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
of last year and it took us probably
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
three years to do it and and we
 
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.669 align:start position:0%
three years to do it and and we
basically

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
put um
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground and um identified um
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
every culvert that we could find um and
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
geo-located it in in gis and
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
developed a an inventory
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
with attributes for each one of those
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
culverts and we also had a a fairly
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
rough uh culvert condition assessment
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
that was done and so um
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
5000 culverts and and we've got we've
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
got an initial inventory and the next
 
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
step in that process
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
is to do a more detailed culvert
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
inspection of for those culverts that
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
were identified as poor condition so
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
we've developed that we haven't we've
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
got a pilot program to uh implement
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that we're not we're
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
doing things that are
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
efficient um as a
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
from an inspection standpoint i mean
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
these can be labor intensive so we want
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
what we're doing before we implement it
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
is is is the right thing but we've got
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
that in place and we plan to implement
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
from and and we'll use this uh inventory
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
in order to um prioritize our culvert
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
investment for that program so this is a
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it but this is more
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
formalized approach to identify those
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
culverts in in that are in in more so in
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
poor condition and also identify those
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
culverts that are um could use
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
resiliency um upsizing um in order to
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
meet the uh
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
the appropriate flows
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
um the second part of the plan um again
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
consistent with how we've approached
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
other new funding in in the 10-year plan
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
in this round
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
we identify existing projects that are
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
making resiliency investments
 
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.230 align:start position:0%
making resiliency investments
and

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of developing a
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
coastal flood risk tolerance framework
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
in order to again prioritize some of the
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
investments identify investments
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
that are that we get the biggest bang
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
for the buck as we as we look at look at
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
sea level rise and also
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
rainfall intensity so this is more than
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
more than um
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
sea coast related but that's kind of
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's a lot of the focus
 
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.029 align:start position:0%
that's that's a lot of the focus
so

00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
again our plan would be to utilize the
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
crdr program for smaller size projects
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that's around less than five million
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
dollars again to uh for the resiliency
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
piece of those projects
 
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.830 align:start position:0%
piece of those projects
um

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
and we would introduce individual
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
projects through the 10-year plan
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
process to address larger scale
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
investment needs
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
so we've established a dot review
 
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.270 align:start position:0%
so we've established a dot review
committee

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years which
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
really reviews uh new uh projects that
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
are being submitted by regional planning
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
commissions for in inclusion into the
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
ten year plan and this this committee
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
um would also take a look um at existing
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
projects and these new projects to
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are all
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
consider climate change and address
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
resiliency needs were appropriate so
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
we've got a second look at this
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.630 align:start position:0%
and we're
implementing

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
implementing
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
these responsibilities so that we um we
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
we cover the entire gamut of projects
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we do have in the plan
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
um i've identified
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
some of the projects that we
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
think would be a good fit that are
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
existing currently today in the in the
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
draft 10-year plan on the smaller side
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
we've got a a project in rye on 1a a
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
culvert replacement project
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
there's also a
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
culvert replacement project in gilmerton
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire 107 and we have
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
a number of colors two or three culverts
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
in shelburne on us2
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
that would fit
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
existing projects that
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
are have resiliency components to them
 
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
are have resiliency components to them
um

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
an engineering assessment for a bridge
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
in greenland which is included in in
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
this draft on new hampshire 33 over the
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
winnicott river
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
that would be appropriate for those
 
00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.310 align:start position:0%
that would be appropriate for those
investments

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
investments
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
some of the larger
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
projects and and where we see there's a
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
real opportunity
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
as these projects
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the engineering is completed
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
to a greater level once we know more
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
about them that we could
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
position ourselves to be
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
well positioned for
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
applying for some of the discretionary
 
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.669 align:start position:0%
applying for some of the discretionary
grants

00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
that are available
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
hampton ocean boulevard is one of those
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
projects that we think would be
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
really well suited for discretionary
 
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.310 align:start position:0%
really well suited for discretionary
grant

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
there's also a seawall reconstruction
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
project that we've evaluated in
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
northampton on northampton rye
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
that would be a a good discretionary
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
grant project
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
and also we have a
 
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:02.950 align:start position:0%
and also we have a
an

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
interchange reconfiguration in in
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
hampton uh new hampshire 101 and us1
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
again larger scale project
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
that does have some um
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
that is impacted by sea level rise so
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
those are the types of projects that's
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
our a basic plan about how we would
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
approach the use of these funds
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
and it's also and again it's consistent
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
with how we've approached the additional
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
funding that we've received on the
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
federal side
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
can maintain those uh the prioritization
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's included in the in the 10-year
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
plan try to advance those projects and
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative ebal
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you guys
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
for coming here i'm actually really
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear that you've done the
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
inventory of the culverts and that
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking closely at this
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
several years ago i served on a storm a
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislative stormwater commission and
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
we talked a lot about culverts and how
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
important they are in so many ways and i
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
think they're just sort of hidden and we
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
don't worry about them so much but they
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
play such a huge part
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
i'd be interested what do you mean by a
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
resilience component resilience
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
component i mean there's there's some
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
concern out there that we just keep
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
making our culverts bigger there are
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
other considerations
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
and then um i know one of the things
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
that we have talked about over the years
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i've read about is just
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
the effect on fish and you know and you
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
know so they're coming up with new
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
designs of culverts instead of just the
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
pipe their boxes so you get better flow
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you just talk a little bit about
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
those subjects as you seek to replace
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i guess all of that uh we consider
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
resiliency um you know uh sizing uh
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
would be more uh um
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know in you know off the seacoast
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
inner new hampshire in in mountain areas
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of large storms over the
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
summers that have done some serious
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
damage to our roads uh many of much of
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
that damage is some most uh associated
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
with undersized um culverts and and um
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know rivers that are raging want to
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
go where they want to go and so that
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
would be one of those areas that because
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
of rainfall intensity the increase in
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
rainfall intensity
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
we would seek to make sure that we
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
address those types of of
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
of changes as we look to
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
replace culverts that are that are aging
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things i would add is um
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
because we're oftentimes seeking federal
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for repairs that are done
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
in response to
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
a storm
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
we have all of that work
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
geo-located and mapped in gis so we know
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
which areas of the state have been
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
hardest hit when we've had
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
these significant rainfall events in the
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
summer months and so that helps inform
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know which infrastructure might need
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
to be evaluated from a resiliency
 
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.630 align:start position:0%
to be evaluated from a resiliency
component

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
could you
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
could you speak a little bit to the the
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
issue of the
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
the design of the culvert of their pipes
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
if they're boxes and how that
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
works with uh fish you know rivers
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering about the designs um
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
so one of these projects that we have on
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
the list here the rye on new hampshire
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
1a culvert replacement
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
is one that we've partnered with the
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
nature conservancy they've done some
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
work up front to look at
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
tidal flows and one of the one of the
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
goals of that project was to improve uh
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
fist fish passage um overall
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
and so there's been a lot of hydraulic
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
work that's been done in order to
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
properly size that that culvert to
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
improve that situation but also not to
 
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.110 align:start position:0%
improve that situation but also not to
um

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
size it so that it doesn't have adverse
 
00:28:27.919 --> 00:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
size it so that it doesn't have adverse
impacts

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
inland side uh because of the tidal
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
flows so that's that's always a
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
challenge um
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
on the engineering's on the engineering
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
side and so
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
all of those factors uh come into play
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
size shape
 
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:47.269 align:start position:0%
size shape
um

00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.630 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
natural bottom
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
of the of the the structure itself
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
because it's a work session i'm just
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
going to say i'm really familiar with
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
the tnc work and so that's sort of what
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
led to my question and um i'm glad to
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
hear you're working with them and taking
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
those things into consideration um i
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
would add that um
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
resiliency um doesn't mean in all cases
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
that um you know it's the the solution
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
is raising the road to keep it out of
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
the water it's um so that that can be an
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
expensive proposition
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
um and also may not um
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
the road may be out of the water but
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
everything else is underwater so we try
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
to make it um
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
the the uh the retreat of the water and
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
the receding of the water um to be in a
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
in a place that we can we can utilize
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
that road in in a expeditious manner
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
without a lot of work so that would be
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
all right okay i have a question does
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
federally eligible federal so it doesn't
 
00:30:11.679 --> 00:30:12.630 align:start position:0%
federally eligible federal so it doesn't
apply

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
further a follow-up question it doesn't
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to help municipal roads
 
00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.070 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to help municipal roads
right

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
we need to be a federally eligible uh
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
road okay good thank you very much thank
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:32.390 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for
 
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:33.590 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for
[Music]

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
providing this this is really good to
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
it was interesting to see how you were
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
addressing uh
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
some of the money that's come through on
 
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.269 align:start position:0%
some of the money that's come through on
this

00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
435 page
 
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
act that got put through the summary
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh one question i had is there's also
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh resiliency money in for the army
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
corps and in some cases it seems to have
 
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.230 align:start position:0%
corps and in some cases it seems to have
overlapping

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
overlapping
 
00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.509 align:start position:0%
overlapping
um

00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
let's say need uh because there are some
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
places uh
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
even inland where there might be a uh a
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
need be both uh transportation wise and
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
army call wise to protect and sometimes
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know for sure which which
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
it is do you do you coordinate at all
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
whatever agency would be dealing with
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
the with the corps for some of these uh
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
grants that are also there's a lot of
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
them uh but by the core and even some by
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
they're they're one of our uh partners
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
um so we do
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know we meet with with those
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders core
 
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
stakeholders core
um

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
epa on a monthly basis we have we have
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings with them and and we
 
00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.549 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings with them and and we
would

00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
coordinate um as necessary to get work
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
done and and look to leverage funds
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
okay thanks because there's some places
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
where it's it's debatable whether it's
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a core situation or it's a
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
it's a d.o.t situation so
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
okay and thanks again for providing this
 
00:32:01.279 --> 00:32:02.389 align:start position:0%
okay and thanks again for providing this
information

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to hampton can you explain
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
a little more on what you
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
anticipate doing down in hampton
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
and i'm not a rep from hampton but i do
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of work down there and
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
i understand that area very well
 
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.070 align:start position:0%
i understand that area very well
so

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
for many years there's been discussions
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
about the need to reconstruct ocean
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
boulevard in the town of hampton
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's something that
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
the hampton beach area commission has
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of 10-year plan cycles ago
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
there was a project introduced
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
at this point given the timing of when
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
the funds were programmed there really
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a significant amount of work
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
done yet we have started some of the
 
00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.269 align:start position:0%
done yet we have started some of the
initial

00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
data collection as i talked about for
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
the hudson project doing survey and
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
understanding where the existing
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
drainage infrastructure is the condition
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
that it's in
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
but we're only now
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
starting to meet with the town of
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
hampton to talk about
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
what their goal for the project would be
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
and exactly what we'd hoped to
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish there was a lot of advocacy
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
during this 10-year plan cycle
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
during the gasset phase
 
00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.269 align:start position:0%
during the gasset phase
um

00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know i think councillor stevens and
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
the governor both understand the
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
importance of the ocean boulevard
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
project but the challenge has been um
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
until we do some more design we really
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
reach agreement on what the scope is
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
it's hard to estimate what the true cost
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
would be and so similar to several other
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
projects in the 10-year plan our goal
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
over the next um
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
12 to 18 months is to really work with
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
the town understand exactly what the
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
scope is so either in the next 10-year
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
plan cycle we could
 
00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
allocate a more appropriate amount of
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
money or as pete said
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
ocean boulevard in particular would be a
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
great candidate for some of these
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
discretionary grants at least from what
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
we know about these programs today and
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
we'd want to position new hampshire to
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
be able to compete to access those
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
dollars but we have to do more design
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
work to make sure we understand exactly
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
what the scope the cost and the schedule
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to go after those dollars
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
and what would the impact on the park be
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
down there
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
with their parking lots and that along
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
route 1a
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
so these are all the factors that have
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
to be taken into consideration state
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
parks would be one of the stakeholders
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
working with us so we have an advisory
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
group already established with park
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
representation that we can hear from the
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
different impacted
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
stakeholders along the corridor yeah
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
because the impact on the park's parking
 
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.909 align:start position:0%
because the impact on the park's parking
meter

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
meter
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
operation would be dramatic if that's
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
changed and even you know construction
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
scheduling it's going to be an effort to
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
agree upon what the final
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
configuration should look like but
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
managing the construction and minimizing
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
the impact on the use of the beach each
 
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.149 align:start position:0%
the impact on the use of the beach each
season

00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
season
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
is going to be something that's going to
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
thought through very carefully in
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
partnership with the town and all the
 
00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.190 align:start position:0%
partnership with the town and all the
stakeholders

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
there's a drainage
 
00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:06.069 align:start position:0%
there's a drainage
at

00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
boar's head
 
00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:09.349 align:start position:0%
boar's head
that

00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
works into the
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
salt marsh behind
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's king's highway it's called
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
and those areas get flooded quite often
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
and i was asked by the town of hampton
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago to look at that
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
and see if there was a way we could
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
mitigate that to some extent we flew a
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
drone over it and
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
surveyed it and i basically what i told
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
them is the army corps
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
involved in doing that marsh but the
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
problem is the drainage back to the
 
00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.030 align:start position:0%
problem is the drainage back to the
ocean

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
ocean
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
is restricted and would need to be
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
considered in your plan
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
because if that isn't made bigger you're
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
never going to stop the problem out
 
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:50.710 align:start position:0%
never going to stop the problem out
there

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
particularly with the phragmites weeds
 
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.790 align:start position:0%
particularly with the phragmites weeds
explosion

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
explosion
 
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
explosion
but

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
just curious how those are going to work
 
00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.550 align:start position:0%
just curious how those are going to work
out

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
mike

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
mike
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
thanks ms chairman
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i wanted to comment on that
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
particular project we just did have a
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
pac meeting on that uh last week
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
it you know it's been
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat held up by the situation we've
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
had with kovid and been able to get
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
accurate you know traffic studies and
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
things but hopefully now it's gonna
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
they've said that we're really gonna get
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
going on that
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
but the uh
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
we do have money presently in
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
in the uh 10-year plan for this it's an
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
existing one and and that has been quite
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
a topic over the last couple ten years
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
playing you know when we've had our uh
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
you know hearings on it uh in hampton
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
and as a result of one of them a
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
previous one you know there was extra
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
money put into for design work so we
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
could design it pretty much get a pretty
 
00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
good idea how much it was going to cost
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
all the way from the bridge down to high
 
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.589 align:start position:0%
all the way from the bridge down to high
street

00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
street
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
and and you know that hopefully that
 
00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.630 align:start position:0%
and and you know that hopefully that
will

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know keep going and we'll get a
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
result of that because that was going to
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
give us hopefully you know a rough idea
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
what the price was because the one that
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
was done in in 18
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh had a price to it that was done by
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
the you know the hampton uh area
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
commission there and it was uh it was in
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
a range of 25 or 28 million at that time
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know just roughing it out for that
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
distance so we have a rough idea to know
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
that we're probably well short with the
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
roughly 9 million we have in so
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
as much as we can with not knowing
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're going to do get
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
get some type of an idea get that
 
00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.710 align:start position:0%
get some type of an idea get that
engineering

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
that preliminary engineering done so we
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
can have that idea whether it's 30
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
million or 40 million or what because
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
there are some pretty complicated
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
things that have to be uh be resolved
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
especially with some of the rules we
 
00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
have with you know drainage off of
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
highways and stuff so hopefully that
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
will that will get going and once we get
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
that idea we can see you know maybe
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
address the rest of it in the uh 10-year
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
plan but even better uh with this uh
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
with this program we have you know with
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
the feds with the protect
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
protect money at least for some of it
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work to do and
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully and and we've been told we're
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
really going to get going on it now so
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
marty

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
marty
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you coming
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
back to hudson for a moment
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
am i understanding that the hudson
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
project was not the first time the rpc
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
got involved is after they had already
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
delivered the
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
priorities to the gasset and
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear on why we're
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh taking that out of the rpc
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
requirements and priority phase and
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
considering it at this time if i'm
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
um so you're correct representative um
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
hudson did not submit
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
the boulevard project as a candidate
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
when the rpcs conducted their
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
solicitation for projects to be
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
introduced into the 10-year plan
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
but many times communities miss that
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
window of opportunity
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
whether it's turnover and staff or other
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
factors just not knowing the process
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
and it's not unusual for us to get
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
requests like this in the house or
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
senate phase
 
00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:24.470 align:start position:0%
senate phase
so

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
this project isn't new in the sense that
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
there has been work done
 
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.829 align:start position:0%
there has been work done
and

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's why we'll do our best to bring
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
some information forward to the
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee for your consideration
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
and it's really not unusual for
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
individual members of the general court
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
to come before us with pet projects and
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
for us to have to decide what we're
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
going to do with them or not do it
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
with them
 
00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:50.630 align:start position:0%
with them
um

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
and in this case that in
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
many ways that's what's happening here
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
they they brought it up
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the department but it's also been
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh by members of of uh the hudson
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
delegation to
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
the the new hampshire house so we were
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to hear it one way or another so
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
i'd rather have them have some kind of
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
background information for us next week
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
than just come in
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh cold from a
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
but i agree it should have gone through
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
so we can move on from the protect
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
program if there's no further questions
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
um so the other item
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
that sparked some discussion last week
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
was the capital corridor rail project
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
and there was specifically some
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
questions around how we were forecasting
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
the ridership
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
and should a rail service be established
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
between lowell
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
and manchester um so we have some
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
information to pass that on that today
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
i think there's been some
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
inaccurate reporting of data that the
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
department has been releasing through
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
the public process
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
as we've advanced what we're calling the
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
project development phase of the capital
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
corridor rail project
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
um the department completed a
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
feasibility study back in 2014
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
and of course
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
many things have changed since that time
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's the demographics of the
 
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.750 align:start position:0%
whether it's the demographics of the
state

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
the models that
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
federal transit administration
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
encourages you use to forecast ridership
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
as well as of course the effects of the
 
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
covet 19 pandemic and so what we have
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
prepared and we'll pass out in a moment
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
is just a one pager that tries to make
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
this as close to an apples to apples
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
comparison as possible recognizing these
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
different factors um
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
and how things were estimated back in
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
2014 compared to today
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
i think one of the um
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
articles i had read after one of our
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the feasibility study we talked about
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
round trips
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
and in some of our recent documentation
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about one-way trips
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
or the number of people that board a
 
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.430 align:start position:0%
or the number of people that board a
train

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
train
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
and so that was why we thought it was
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
important especially after the questions
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
last week to put together this document
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
out and i just want to stress in the
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
project development phase of the capital
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
corridor project is an ongoing effort
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
and so we've had a number of meetings
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
up until recently the focus was really
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
on identifying the exact locations of
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
the stations
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the layover facility in
 
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.030 align:start position:0%
as well as the layover facility in
manchester

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
our team
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
has been meeting with
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
folks from
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
massdot and the mbta
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
to understand exactly what the station
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
requirements would be
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
to meet their standards
 
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.670 align:start position:0%
to meet their standards
and

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
we've been presenting our assumptions
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
around the service frequency
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
to get their concurrence as well
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so those conversations are ongoing
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
but we are getting closer now to being
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
able to estimate much more accurately
 
00:43:19.109 --> 00:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
both the construction cost as well as
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
the operating expenses
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
and so we're now embarking on
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
the next portion of this phase of the
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
project which is to develop the
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
financial plan
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
and talk about how
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
we potentially would fund this project
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
of course we can't have a conversation
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
around funding without having that
 
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
accurate cost information
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
so the two pieces will now be advanced
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
in parallel as we refine the cost
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
estimates and finalize those we're
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
starting to talk about the different
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
federal programs that are available
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
and instead of just looking at how other
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
states have funded a rail project hone
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
in on really what would be feasible in
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.230 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
given

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
the current sources of revenue and the
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
current restrictions on the use of
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
different types of revenue
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
but we thought it was important to share
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
the ridership information because that
 
00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:07.839 align:start position:0%
seemed to be what this committee was
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.829 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate what you
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh stated at one of our previous
 
00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:21.349 align:start position:0%
uh stated at one of our previous
meetings

00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
the study that is
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
being done at the moment
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
the preliminary planning
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
2023 if i if i remember correctly
 
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.470 align:start position:0%
2023 if i if i remember correctly
and

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
well beyond the the tenure of this
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
the money for that is currently within
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan and it is all federally
 
00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:55.829 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan and it is all federally
funded

00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:44:55.839 --> 00:44:57.270 align:start position:0%
funded
um

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.390 align:start position:0%
um
portion

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
portion
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh for for the uh
 
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.950 align:start position:0%
uh for for the uh
um

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
what was the term you used i'm trying to
 
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.390 align:start position:0%
what was the term you used i'm trying to
remember

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
project development i had a problem with
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so we try to avoid calling this
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
phase a study because we did the
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
feasibility study back in 2014 that's
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
what identified the preferred
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
alternative of a commuter rail service
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
up to manchester um so yes we call this
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
the project development phase so really
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
it's the engineering updating the
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
environmental permitting
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
and completing the financial plan to
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
really present information to the
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
legislature and decision makers so you
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
can decide how you want to move forward
 
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
or if you want to move forward with
 
00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:42.069 align:start position:0%
or if you want to move forward with
construction

00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
for a project of this size and scale
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's likely that we'd have to apply for
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
some of these discretionary grants they
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
are competitive that even if the state
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to move forward we'd have to go
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
through that process
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
and we may not be successful the first
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
time we apply
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of uncertainty about
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
first of all would the project move
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
forward but even if there was support
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
from the legislature and others to do so
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
the exact timing because of
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
any questions on
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
you've had a chance really quick to read
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah do you know uh
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner when this
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
project development phase of the capital
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
korea project is to be done completed in
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
2023 any idea an exact date or even an
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
estimated date
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're targeting early in 2023 but an
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
exact date hasn't been established
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
um you know we're just starting the
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
financial planning work now
 
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.790 align:start position:0%
financial planning work now
and

00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're really reliant on
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
the cities of nashua and manchester and
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
all the stakeholders to meet with us and
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
help us vet these different options
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
we'll know more about uh the exact sched
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
schedule as we get into the summer
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
months and we've had some of these
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
initial conversations
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes hi following up following up on that
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
what i've read is january but i don't
 
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
know when in january of 2023
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
that the project development phase
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
information will come in how does that
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
date or that month
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
in 2023
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
how does that dovetail with timing
 
00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.710 align:start position:0%
how does that dovetail with timing
for

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
applying for
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
monies and things in other words
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
just january um is that a good time to
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
be ready to go and then then you have to
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
be putting something forward before
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
spring summer fall
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
i think it's really premature to
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
when is a good time to start applying
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
for those funds
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
our task was to complete this project
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
development phase to provide the much
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
needed information and exact cost data
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
to decision makers
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
we estimate how long it would take to
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
complete that effort and especially you
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
know with the pandemic
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
um it's been challenging to conduct some
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
of those meetings so we're targeting
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
early 2023 to complete the work
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
um but until we see how
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
the final product is received um we
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
don't know whether or not there might be
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
changes in statute that are required
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
we don't know the exact timing of when
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
some of these discretionary grant
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities might be
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
moved forward so there's a lot of
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
question marks still we just have to
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
complete this work and we ask for folks
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
to be patient um to let us
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
conclude the design effort so that we
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
have accurate costs to really inform the
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
no other questions on what was presented
 
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.670 align:start position:0%
no other questions on what was presented
about

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit on the capital corridor
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
if not
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
i think there
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
might be one or two other items if i
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
i think we've covered everything that
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
was discussed during our work session
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
i think the one other item that we were
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
asked to provide information on was the
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance costs associated
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
with continental boulevard
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
and so i'm gonna actually ask bill cass
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
to share some information
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
um this is continental boulevard in the
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
town of merrimack for those of you who
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
aren't familiar with that location
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
i think all the veteran members are
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
ah good morning william cass assistant
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner i think the question was uh
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
what is our general maintenance cost
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
annual maintenance cost for maintaining
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh continental boulevard so we maintain
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
continental boulevard from
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
exit 10 out to the old camp sergeant
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
road and down to um 101a
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
2.8 miles and
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
our estimate is it's about 80 000 a year
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
of annual maintenance which is primarily
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
the uh winter maintenance plowing salt
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
use things like that
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
i haven't we haven't factored in uh
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
annual repaving or things like that but
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
just for an order of magnitude
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
it was last resurfaced in 2017
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
typically that
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
level of built road would have a cycle
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
of about once every every 10 years so
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's relatively new pavement about
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
halfway through its uh service life and
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
it was about
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh hundred thousand dollars in 2017 to
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh pave that um with a maintenance
 
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
one-inch overlay so that gives you an
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
in the future or sometime you could
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
either annualize it or if it needs to be
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
resurfaced at some point in the future
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know about that amount with
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
whatever inflation would be in
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
the next five years or something like
 
00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers gives you the
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
information you look uh and
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
just clarify that is all turnpike funds
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
does that mean yes that's all turnpike
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
funds that maintain that section of um
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
and and we just took down the tollbooth
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you doing that on on
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
semi-quick notice so that we at least
 
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.190 align:start position:0%
semi-quick notice so that we at least
have

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
an idea if we discuss what we want to do
 
00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:09.589 align:start position:0%
an idea if we discuss what we want to do
with

00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
um the effie everett and widening and
 
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:14.390 align:start position:0%
um the effie everett and widening and
and

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's all in there and what we want to do
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
with continental boulevard which will be
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
an item of discussion
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
and bill william
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner cass while you're sitting
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
there um
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
along with the commissioner
 
00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
along with the commissioner
um

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussion over the
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
last couple weeks about sound walls yes
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
is there any utility
 
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.829 align:start position:0%
is there any utility
to

00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
having some kind of study committee
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
to look at the rules
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
are are
 
00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.670 align:start position:0%
are are
you

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
continually upgrading them uh revising
 
00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
them based on federal guidance and the
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
rest i'm trying to satisfy
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
several members around this table
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
some of them who are here and some of
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
them who are not
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
as to
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
what is eligible what is not eligible
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should include
 
00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:25.270 align:start position:0%
whether or not we should include
schools

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the process those types of things i i
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
just don't know
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
what whether it would be useful to have
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
some kind of legislative study
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
of the whole all the rules or if gelcar
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
handles that adequately for as in
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
i know there's been a lot of interest in
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
the topic of sound walls you know we as
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
a department want to be good neighbors
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
strive to mitigate the impacts of our
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
projects and so we do follow closely
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
what's happening nationally and federal
 
00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.950 align:start position:0%
what's happening nationally and federal
guidelines

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
as we develop our noise policies
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
um so you know we're happy to continue
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
to work with the legislature if you
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
think a study committee would be
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
a good opportunity for us to help
 
00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:17.670 align:start position:0%
a good opportunity for us to help
educate

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
educate
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
on the process that we do follow
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
and how our thresholds were established
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
then certainly we'd welcome that
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to help people understand
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
the work that we do
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
if the intent is to
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
provide recommendations to the
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
department or to modify our policy
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
we're still limited in what we can
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
change because of the federal
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
requirements and i've said this before
 
00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:42.789 align:start position:0%
requirements and i've said this before
um

00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
you know while there's advocacy when
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing these type 1 projects you
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
know where we're widening a highway and
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
as part of that we're mitigating noise
 
00:54:52.710 --> 00:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
if there's advocacy for broadening
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
the scope and building more sound walls
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
as part of those projects
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
well then that's increasing the list of
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
people who would be eligible for a sound
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
wall elsewhere in the state but we don't
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
happen to be doing a project at this
 
00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:05.190 align:start position:0%
happen to be doing a project at this
time

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
we've really strongly encouraged the
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to think about funding that
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
type 2 program there are a lot of people
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
who live along highway corridors that if
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
we were building a project today they
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
would qualify for a sound wall
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
and so from an equity perspective
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
the department has said many times you
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
know we would
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
welcome the opportunity to start funding
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
some of those type 2 projects
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
but that seems to sometimes be
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
overlooked because the focus is on
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
expanding the scope of the projects that
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
we are completing today
 
00:55:36.559 --> 00:55:37.670 align:start position:0%
we are completing today
and

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
the one last thing i would note and i
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
shared it with um representative query
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
who had questions i can share with you
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
or the rest of the committee i think it
 
00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.150 align:start position:0%
or the rest of the committee i think it
was

00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
around 2015 2016 with some uh
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
bills in the legislature there was a
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
there was a um study commission the the
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
report is still um on the legislative
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
website um
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
that made that that
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
may provide some
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
of that background information there was
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
a legislative committee about
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah six seven years ago
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
um yes um
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
sharing that information but um you also
 
00:56:21.839 --> 00:56:22.950 align:start position:0%
sharing that information but um you also
said

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner that
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
you were gonna distribute a map showing
 
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.030 align:start position:0%
you were gonna distribute a map showing
the

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
i apologize yes we have packets we'll
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
pass them out now um showing the exact
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
limits of the uh
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
project on 95 and the sections of sound
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.200 --> 00:57:34.230 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
and if you could just point out
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
to us commissioner
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
where this area where the
 
00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:42.630 align:start position:0%
where this area where the
school

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
is what page is that on
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
sure so the the first page is the is a
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
broad overview of 93 with a
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
i mean 95 excuse me where um it splits
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
to the turnpi um spalding turnpike going
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
north the portsmouth traffic circle and
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
kind of the middle of that first
 
00:58:00.079 --> 00:58:01.270 align:start position:0%
kind of the middle of that first
document

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
95 associated kind of um
 
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.230 align:start position:0%
95 associated kind of um
it's

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
left to right across the across the page
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
which is south south to north
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
so it's part of the um project to um
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
consider uh using the shoulders over the
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
high level bridge and that actually
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
goes from about the traffic circle to
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
exit um
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
to in
 
00:58:26.799 --> 00:58:27.670 align:start position:0%
to in
maine

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
maine
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
is where we're looking at um
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
we call dynamic or or on shoulder use
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
dynamic shoulder running
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
where um we're going to be deploying
 
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.750 align:start position:0%
where um we're going to be deploying
some

00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
its to allow um
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
traffic to run on the shoulders during
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
periods of high traffic volume and and
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
ease some of the congestion over the
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
high level bridge so associated with
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
that project we were obligated
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
to do a uh noise analysis in the whole
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
area so this kind of summarizes that so
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
we looked at
 
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.390 align:start position:0%
we looked at
um

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
you know seven or eight different
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods along that whole corridor
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what these maps again the
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
maps kind of follow from
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
south to north
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
so if you look at
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
eight which is study area three it's
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
about the fourth page in
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
second page fourth page double-sided
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
and it's in the bottom right that it
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
that it shows the uh figure eight
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
that is one of the areas um which was a
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
now and analyzed that is um
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
panaway manor
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
um that is an area that that has um
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
strong justification and meeting the
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for a sound wall so that's
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
why that one is is is showing green and
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
it shows the details of the number of
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
benefited receptors and all of that it's
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers are there if you want to
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
look closer but that's one of the
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
two areas that did
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
qualify for a sound wall if you look at
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
the next page figure nine there's
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
another little neighborhood there um
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that conceptual sound wall there is
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
shown as as orange
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
that is an area that didn't meet the um
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
that didn't meet the requirements of our
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
policy so we did evaluate it and it is
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
not getting a sound wall
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
the next page
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
and the next three pages kind of cover
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
the same area so figure 10
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
figure 11
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
and figure 12.
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
that is the area that we have been
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
talking about on the west side of 93 or
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
the top of the page is the area around
 
01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:56.789 align:start position:0%
the top of the page is the area around
um

01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's rockingham ave is the closest is
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
the is the closest there
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
um that is an area that qualifies for a
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
sound wall and and will be proposing
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
building a sound wall
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
on the east side of 95 through that area
 
01:01:12.079 --> 01:01:13.190 align:start position:0%
on the east side of 95 through that area
um

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
which is the bottom half of that page
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
you can see um just coming out of just
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
north of the traffic circle there is a
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
school there and that is one of the
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
areas on particularly
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
figure 12
 
01:01:28.799 --> 01:01:30.069 align:start position:0%
figure 12
where

01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's shown as orange that was the
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
concept that was the sound wall area
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
that that we looked at
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
and again based on the policy that is
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
one of the areas that didn't meet the
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
reasonableness criteria and we're not
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
proposing a sound wall there so that's a
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
general area and some of the
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
background i could answer more details
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
but that gives you the orientation of
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
hopefully

01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
i'm the
 
01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.589 align:start position:0%
i'm the
figure

01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
figure
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
figure eight on on the study area three
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
is that the is that the pan away manner
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
is that the development that has been
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
maybe there's others but is that the one
 
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's been waiting for 30 years
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that neighborhood predates the
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
widening of 95. so that's one of the
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
locations it was the highest priority
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
when we looked at locations that would
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
qualify for a type 2
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
priorities in terms of the cost benefit
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
associated with mitigating noise so it's
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
just now that we're considering the
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
shoulder running that we can go back and
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
look at the noise criteria but
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
technically they qualified even without
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
the shoulder use
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
but we didn't have the funds for a type
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
2 program
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
so now they get to be type 1 because
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing work on 95.
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
can you explain
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
and i noticed that some of this is near
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
the airport
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
runway how how does the
 
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.470 align:start position:0%
runway how how does the
model

01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
take into account both sort of the
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
constant noise of the highway operation
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
occasional perhaps greater noise from
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
airport operations
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously i think you know
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
noise barrier is not going to help with
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
the latter but
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
how does that
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
has a different level of noise impact
 
01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.109 align:start position:0%
has a different level of noise impact
get

01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
considered in the model
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's primarily looked at
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
as analyzing and
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's calibrated to the existing
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
conditions so
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
the modeling
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the highway noise is is set with
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
respect to the overall ambient
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
environment so
 
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.829 align:start position:0%
environment so
any

01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
present existing
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
noise generators like the airport are
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
taken into account in the
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
establishment of the background of the
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
of the overall ambient noise and then
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
once the model is calibrated
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
it evaluates um you know the projected
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
noise with increase in traffic volume
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
and you know 20 years in the future and
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
with and without noise barriers to
 
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.710 align:start position:0%
with and without noise barriers to
evaluate

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
what the noise reduction would be
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
for the proposed barriers and and
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
and do that analysis and
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
analysis and evaluation
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
so essentially
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't directly take into account
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
the airport or other noise
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
generators but it does indirectly in the
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
calibration of of the model to the
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman
 
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.789 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman
um

01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
just just a quick review if you just
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
give me the page numbers of the is it
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
just two of them that you're approving
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned a lot about the
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
various ones but
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes yeah they're just the two the one at
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
panaway manor which was figure eight
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
that uh representative newman had
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
figure 10 and 11 which is uh
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
we've been
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
dubbing at the um rockingham avenue area
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
because rockingham avenue is kind of the
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
closest there by woodman ave but it
 
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.950 align:start position:0%
closest there by woodman ave but it
covers

01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
covers
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
rockingham avenue and edmond avenue so
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's the west side of
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you just just just an observation
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
i pointed out the one on figure
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
9 that didn't qualify typically we find
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
there needs to be
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
somewhat anecdotal but it's but it's
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know a fairly
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
dense neighborhood like panaway manor
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
like rockingham ave on the west side
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know runs longitudinally parallel to
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
the facility that tends to have the
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
density that tends to have
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
the reasonableness to
 
01:06:19.039 --> 01:06:19.990 align:start position:0%
the reasonableness to
to

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
um merit noise mitigation
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
um the individual houses or the
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
individual streets that tend to come
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
down and dead end at the highway with
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
four or five streets at the end of it
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
that those typically don't
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
have the have the density to qualify for
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
for noise barriers and they're
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
even on the area of the school
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
there are several of those neighborhoods
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
um like myrtle avenue and stuff there
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
are smaller clusters of
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
of houses in a smaller neighborhood
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
but again at um
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
four or five six houses at the end of
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
the street they don't tend to meet the
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
cost for reasonableness criteria to
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
build a wall so
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
the visual of the aerial mapping can can
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
point that out more than the specific
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the work that went into
 
01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.549 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the work that went into
these

01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
visual representation of what we're
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
doing because
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
sound walls are going to continue to be
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
an item of discussion
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
not just in the house and the senate but
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
with the public at large
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
i can only imagine what will happen when
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
we finally get around to widening the
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
effie everett uh
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
it will be a lot of the same questions
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
about wine here and why not there
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
um so i think that it it is good that
 
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.910 align:start position:0%
um so i think that it it is good that
the

01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
this committee at least is getting
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
a better handle on the criteria
 
01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.789 align:start position:0%
a better handle on the criteria
um

01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
even if
 
01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
some of us think that
 
01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh within our own communities that it
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
should have been built and they just
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't meet the criteria
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
but at least we understand why
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that's important
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh marty
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh some years ago there was
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
a hearing on the on the widening project
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
and at exit 8 there was a set of
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
residents who were
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
as upset as the ones in bedford
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
barry additional question thank you
 
01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.870 align:start position:0%
barry additional question thank you
um

01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
are there some
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
non-noise wall
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
solutions that could be funded out of
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
highway funds i'm thinking
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
especially considering the school a
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
double painting or triple painting
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
windows and other
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
noise mitigations that are
 
01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.829 align:start position:0%
noise mitigations that are
not

01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
on the highway but
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
but are closer to the receptor they
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
are they eligible or has anybody
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the things with with
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
highway noise and and the federal policy
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
is is is it's a geared at
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
mitigating noise in the outside
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
environment it's not necessary to
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate highway noise inside there are
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
some there are some
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
elements of that but
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
from a highway noise perspective
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's extremely it's it's it's never
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
really met i mean when they're talking
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
about insulating windows and stuff like
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
that that are that is usually more
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
um you know very high noise generators
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
like like a jet taking off in the
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
proximity of an airport so most of our
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
policy is geared at
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
protecting um noise barrier for uh
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
for noise mitigation for the outside uh
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
environment around uh around residential
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
but yeah the one thing with that with
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
that said and
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are some mitigating elements that
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
we do try to
 
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.709 align:start position:0%
we do try to
institute

01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
institute
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of areas along 93 and even areas
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
here along 95 this rockingham boulevard
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
or panaway manor they have been areas
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
that have had
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
noise issues for a long time and we have
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
noted that we can't
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't um meet the criteria to um
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh rationalize using
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know constructing big sound walls
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
but we have installed privacy fences
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
stockade fences that at least from a
 
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
stockade fences that at least from a
visual

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
visual
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
kind of thing provide some some buffer
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
and barrier um
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the teaberry lane there in
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
bedford i mean one of their other
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
concerns and the noise was you know
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
people accessing their backyard from the
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
highway and stuff so we at least tried
 
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.669 align:start position:0%
highway and stuff so we at least tried
to

01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
mitigate that so there are some
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
strategies um like that we have
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in portsmouth and in
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.950 align:start position:0%
other areas
um

01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
but they haven't been
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
i've heard people say they don't want
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
the consolation prize they want a noise
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
see now i think commissioner that that
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
was all that we asked you
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
to to bring forward to answer questions
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee if i'm
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
looking at my list right
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
that was everything that i had for the
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
group um unless i missed something the
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
rest of the team can keep me straight
 
01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
rest of the team can keep me straight
and

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
there was some one-off questions not
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
related to the 10-year plan with certain
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee but nothing
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
10-year plan specific beyond what we
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
talked about already
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
what i would like to do at this point
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
is take a 10 minute break by the clock
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
on the wall
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
and then come back and we'll start with
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
is going to ask us to put into the
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
10-year plan as far as
 
01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.430 align:start position:0%
10-year plan as far as
bonding

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
bonding
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure authority and and the rest
 
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.550 align:start position:0%
expenditure authority and and the rest
on

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
there there is some boilerplate that
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
goes into every
 
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.950 align:start position:0%
goes into every
um

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:34.640 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
and we'll go over that and then i
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
there at least a couple of amendments
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
that i want to discuss
 
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.270 align:start position:0%
that i want to discuss
and

01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be here all day so if we
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
could take a 10 minute break
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
mike what
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
if i could ask one quick question on 10
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
year plan a continuation of a question i
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
had last time
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
why don't we wait until after the break
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.840 --> 01:21:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.840 --> 01:25:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay if we could reassemble
 
01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.590 align:start position:0%
okay if we could reassemble
and

01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner handed out
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
some paperwork that explained toll
 
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.629 align:start position:0%
some paperwork that explained toll
credits

01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
and her response to
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
the city of keene when they asked to to
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
quickly if anybody has any questions
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
see none uh
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
oh yes the question i had was uh
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
relative to uh the 10-year plan the
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
portsmouth kittery
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
the route 1 the room bypass
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
the basically it's the
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
the bridge it says bridge replacement
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
but it
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's for the
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
marine dock
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
replacement that uh
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
that d.o.t committed to
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
and i guess i just want to confirm it i
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the money that this is
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:26:33.679 --> 01:26:34.830 align:start position:0%
with this
17

01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
17
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
million um you know in the 4 million we
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
gave for this in the previous 10 year
 
01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:42.470 align:start position:0%
gave for this in the previous 10 year
plan

01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
that the uh that this is sufficient to
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
do this particular project which is to
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
make the port authority hole for the
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
removal of their big barge that these
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
no um
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
one of the delays in that and that has
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
been delayed has been that the costs
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
have escalated
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
whether the initial estimate was too
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
conceptual or not um but
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
um what we have programmed in the
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
is um
 
01:27:20.639 --> 01:27:21.510 align:start position:0%
is um
is

01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
is shy of uh what it's going to cost to
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
replace that that has been one of the
 
01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
replace that that has been one of the
hang-ups

01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
hang-ups
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
about two years ago 2019 as they came in
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
with 66 percent
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
level plans
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
the cost estimate jumped from around 19
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
million to closer to 30 million and now
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
the current estimate is around 32 to
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
34 million um
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
so we have been working with the with
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
the port they're managing the project uh
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
to help uh address that
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
um and talking to some of the
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
policymakers in the governor's office to
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody's on the on the same
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
page so
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh roughly
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
14 million dollar shortfall
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
we had through the budget process last
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
year uh
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
solicited capital budget funds of four
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars to be able to
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh provide a match to a federal grant um
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
a raise grant we went after the we went
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
after the grant we just found out at the
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
end of
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
december that we were unsuccessful in
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
that grant however with the passage of
 
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:35.270 align:start position:0%
that grant however with the passage of
the

01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law we feel we do have
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
capacity with our federal funds to make
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
up that gap so we're proposing
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
meet that shortfall with fy22 federal
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
dollars so about 14 million dollars of
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
additional authority that came in this
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year and fy22
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh to allow us to advertise that project
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
and fully fund it so that's why
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm being precise about fy22 because
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
depicted there shows the projects and
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
the funding from fy 23 through
 
01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.709 align:start position:0%
the funding from fy 23 through
32.

01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
32.
 
01:29:16.719 --> 01:29:18.790 align:start position:0%
32.
so

01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
but the federal bill that was passed the
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
additional infrastructure
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
funding um
 
01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.709 align:start position:0%
funding um
does

01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
does start flowing hopefully if
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
everything else passes that's another
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
issue in fy
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
beginning in fy 22. so we're
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're planning to use
 
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.750 align:start position:0%
we're planning to use
um

01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
additional federal funding in federal
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
22 to advertise the project this summer
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
and fully fund it and get it completed
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
so the current estimate as i said is
 
01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.550 align:start position:0%
so the current estimate as i said is
around

01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
30 32 to 34 million dollars i know it
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
was 32 million dollars a year ago when
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
we had really put nuts to it but
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
as it advertises this year it may be a
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more inflation in the current
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
bidding environment but so that's um
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're um estimating
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay thanks so
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
you you're basically saying that you you
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
feel confident that you're going to be
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
able to have the money do that
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
if if we pass it this this amount right
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
here now in a 10-year plan
 
01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
so the project we consider to be fully
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
funded with federal formula funds
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
i would be remiss if i didn't just
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
asterix all of our federal funds um so
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
while it was um a relief from a
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
transportation perspective to see an
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill passed
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
at the end of last calendar year
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
um we are still working under a
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution from an
 
01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
appropriations perspective
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
and so we have not received authority to
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
spend all of the money that was in the
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
um the current uh continuing resolution
 
01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:01.030 align:start position:0%
um the current uh continuing resolution
expires

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
expires
 
01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.470 align:start position:0%
expires
mid-february

01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
mid-february
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
and so there's been a lot of advocacy
 
01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.350 align:start position:0%
and so there's been a lot of advocacy
from

01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
our industry as a whole
 
01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:07.830 align:start position:0%
our industry as a whole
that

01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
turning the faucet parcel pars
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
partially on and only releasing a
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
portion of the funds that we really need
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to obligate all of the money
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be spent in that first
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
year of the infrastructure bill and so
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
we have received some of the one-time
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
money we got our full 45 million of
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
annual distribution of say the bridge
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
funds but we've only been receiving
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
a portion of our authority
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the traditional formula
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
funds so really it's five and a half
 
01:31:41.110 --> 01:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
twelfths of authority you know the
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year starts october
 
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.470 align:start position:0%
federal fiscal year starts october
through

01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
mid february is sort of five and a half
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
months worth of authority and it's not
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
based on the levels in the
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill it's level funding
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
last year's appropriations
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
so they have not increased it so
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
honestly representative we would
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
like to fund
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
fully the port work in 2022 because it's
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
going to be for all state dots and our
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
partners a struggle
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
if they do turn the faucet back on to
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
obligate all of the first year money
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
between now and the end of september so
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
the timing of this couldn't be better
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's our hope is that
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
um they lift the continuing resolution
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
we get the full funding and then this
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
project is well-timed be able to take
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks john
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
okay commissioner you also handed out
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
um the language that you need
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
does everyone have a copy i think we
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
were a couple short maybe we got some
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
um so not a lot from us this year um
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph is just the standard
 
01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.149 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph is just the standard
language

01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
stating that the legislature would be
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
adopting the 10-year plan
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
as the chair had indicated earlier
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
as we advance the 10-year plan we have
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
to update the authority associated with
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system to reflect the value
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
of the projects that are programmed in
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
so what's included
 
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.950 align:start position:0%
so what's included
is

01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
the required changes to the
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
dollar figures
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
associated with our construction
 
01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.750 align:start position:0%
associated with our construction
improvements

01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
but that's all that we have at this time
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
we would anticipate bringing forward
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
some language with respect to the
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
circumferential highway and hudson
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
boulevard should that be something the
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
committee wants to entertain
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
and we are still going through other
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
statutes to see if there's anything
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily pertain to a
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
project but pertains to how we advance
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
projects where
 
01:34:07.669 --> 01:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
in the past we've
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
done this we've included
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
enabling language in the 10-year plan
 
01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:12.870 align:start position:0%
enabling language in the 10-year plan
bill

01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
to allow us to implement efficiencies or
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
do things differently and we've also
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to the transportation
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
council which is a legislatively
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
legislatively established body that
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
works with the dot
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
um there might be some minor changes
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
they want to make to their authorities
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
to provide better clarity around their
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
roles and responsibilities so we might
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
bring that forward next week but at the
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
moment this is all that we really have
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
to include
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay we would we would appreciate
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
especially if you need
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
any language to give you some latitude
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
in what
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
year you actually do projects based upon
 
01:34:50.159 --> 01:34:51.750 align:start position:0%
year you actually do projects based upon
permitting

01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
funding and all the rest which we've
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
included in prior
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
prior terms
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure that things continue
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
forward even if a particular project
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
gets hung up for some reason
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
so anything we're going to bring forward
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
other than maybe project language for
 
01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.310 align:start position:0%
other than maybe project language for
hudson

01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
hudson
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
um would be something that would walk
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
the committee through if there wasn't
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
time for you to incorporate the
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
amendment we'll introduce it in the
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
senate phase but of course we'd want to
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
present it make sure you're aware of it
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on that the
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
language that that they need at this
 
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.870 align:start position:0%
language that that they need at this
point

01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
and any objection to that being included
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
as an amendment to the 10-year plan
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
everybody hold your peace uh it will be
 
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.709 align:start position:0%
everybody hold your peace uh it will be
included

01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
in in a an amendment that the committee
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
now i do have
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
one well i have actually two but let's
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
this is amendment uh 0 2
 
01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:13.430 align:start position:0%
this is amendment uh 0 2
8

01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
8
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
1 h i have cough drops dead
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's to amend uh the bill
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh and in essence it is ownership
 
01:36:23.199 --> 01:36:24.390 align:start position:0%
uh and in essence it is ownership
transfer

01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
that is part of the the project of
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
widening fe ever
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
it provides that the commissioner
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
shall transfer ownership of the
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
state-owned portion of continental
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
boulevard in merrimack to the town of
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
i bring this forward
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
as a proposed amendment
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that one we just took
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
down the toll booth at exit 10
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
and two
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
you heard the figures that that uh
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
annual maintenance of that 2.8 million
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
2.8 miles of road plus the 700 000 we
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
spent not long ago
 
01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.510 align:start position:0%
spent not long ago
resurfacing

01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
resurfacing
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
resurfacing that
 
01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.950 align:start position:0%
resurfacing that
so

01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
what's the will of the committee on this
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
remember this is straw poll it will be
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
put into an amendment
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the entire committee will be
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
will be discussing that at executive
 
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.470 align:start position:0%
will be discussing that at executive
sessions

01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
however we need to to move forward
 
01:37:42.870 --> 01:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
um with this
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
i would ask the commissioner
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
it i know it's a policy commissioner
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
policy decision commissioner but but it
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
i believe that date would be
 
01:37:59.199 --> 01:38:02.950 align:start position:0%
i believe that date would be
appropriate

01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
like i said i understand that it's a
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
policy decision that that
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm not saying do it tomorrow um
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it would take some negotiations
 
01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:14.310 align:start position:0%
because it would take some negotiations
with

01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.189 align:start position:0%
with
um

01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
the town and the rest
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
any discussion marty
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll just make the additional
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
point that any money that would have
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
been spent on continental boulevard is
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
money that's not spent on other things
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
the town of merrimack might want like
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:34.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.310 align:start position:0%
uh
john

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
john
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
all right i have a question and i just
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
want to be clear about this uh when i
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
first came to this committee we've dealt
 
01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
with the merrimack tolls ever since i've
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
been on this committee it's a long time
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
i believe there were three
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh three tolls
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
now have we removed or there be in the
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
process of removing all the tolls i
 
01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.030 align:start position:0%
process of removing all the tolls i
um

01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.149 align:start position:0%
um
yes

01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
and it's always been done in the senate
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
as part of if i remember correctly as
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
part of uh the budget process and not
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
the the highway fund we started with 12
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
then took out 11 and this time in house
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill two we took out the the tolls at um
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
exit 10. um so there are no further
 
01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:21.750 align:start position:0%
exit 10. um so there are no further
tolls

01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
ramp tolls in the town of merrimack
 
01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.709 align:start position:0%
ramp tolls in the town of merrimack
commissioner

01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
um i will just clarify
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
not only did we zero out the toll
 
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:34.870 align:start position:0%
not only did we zero out the toll
um

01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
at all three locations
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of what infrastructure remains
 
01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:39.430 align:start position:0%
in terms of what infrastructure remains
so

01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
exit 12 has been removed entirely with
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
the exception of the maintenance
 
01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:44.229 align:start position:0%
the exception of the maintenance
building

01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
exit 11
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
we demo demoed the toll plaza we still
 
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
have the maintenance building
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
exit 10
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
the toll was zeroed out
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
on new year's eve and so we still have a
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
toll plaza at that location we plan to
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
demolish that
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
this construction season
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
so then officially all three toll plazas
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
will be gone but there is still a
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
physical plaza at exit 10 we have not
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
completed that work yet
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's still the physical building at
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
12 too so that's
 
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair in order to get the straw poll
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
moving i will move ought to pass on your
 
01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.950 align:start position:0%
moving i will move ought to pass on your
amendment

01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
two eight one h a second
 
01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:38.629 align:start position:0%
two eight one h a second
okay

01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
and again it's a straw poll it's not the
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
final decision
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee because we have to have
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
the entire amendment in front of us
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
all of those in favor of incorporating
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
this into
 
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
a committee amendment for house bill
 
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.390 align:start position:0%
a committee amendment for house bill
2022

01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
signify by saying aye
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
opposed nay the eyes have it and we'll
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
see what happens with the full committee
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i do have a second one wait uh
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the record um i just like an
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
estimate of the annual tolls that have
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
been are lost because we've removed 10
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
11 and 12.
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i'd also like an estimate of the
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
cost of removal the infrastructure
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
i believe those are already part of
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
the planning process in in the turnpike
 
01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.070 align:start position:0%
the planning process in in the turnpike
portion

01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
portion
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
as far as the cost of
 
01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.990 align:start position:0%
as far as the cost of
removing

01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
removing
 
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:46.950 align:start position:0%
removing
um

01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
the structures at 10. we've already done
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
11 and i forget what that cost us last
 
01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.350 align:start position:0%
11 and i forget what that cost us last
year

01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
but um yeah it was
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
but what we're losing in revenue
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
um i think that's a fair question
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have all of that information readily
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
available and because this matter was
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
taken up many times by the legislature
 
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
we provided testimony so we can share
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
the cost of removal of 12 what we spent
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
removing 11
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
the budgeted cost for removing 10
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
and what we anticipate the cost of
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
removal of the buildings will be but
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
that work will be done as part of the
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
effie everett widening
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
making a distinction between the toll
 
01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.189 align:start position:0%
making a distinction between the toll
operations

01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the plazas themselves and then the
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
administration building at each location
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
and then the last revenue we can share
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
um what the total was from
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
the idea here is to just show
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of removal plus the loss of the
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
tolls versus the costs of continental
 
01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
boulevard i mean it's just i think it's
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't get to that did we get to oh
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah we did get to the straw throttle
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay the second one that is being
 
01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:14.229 align:start position:0%
okay the second one that is being
proposed

01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
is zero two
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
six one h and when somebody makes sure
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
this proposed
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
changed to
 
01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:39.990 align:start position:0%
changed to
[Music]

01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
the bedford merrimack
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
project 16
 
01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.990 align:start position:0%

100

01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
100
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
which is the mainline toll plaza
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
which is in the
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
current 10-year plan
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
turned over to all electronic towing
 
01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.109 align:start position:0%
turned over to all electronic towing
and

01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
the removal of the current toll
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that stretch across the fv
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
amends that particular project
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
mainline toll plaza which will be all
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
electronic towing
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
move to the vicinity of the current exit
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
the rationale for this is
 
01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.470 align:start position:0%
the rationale for this is
primarily

01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
it is easy to circumvent if um
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
the main line at bedford
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
um if you want to do that
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh and second we are not capturing
 
01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
any of the traffic that is going to
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh the airport
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
we have to move it far far enough away
 
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.109 align:start position:0%
we have to move it far far enough away
from

01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh resort way
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
the feds because that was built with
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
federal highway funds
 
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
we could build it
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
as currently envisioned at where it is
 
01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.629 align:start position:0%
as currently envisioned at where it is
now

01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
or we move it further south to capture
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's not going to change the cost
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
i mean no matter what we do we're going
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
to have to put up a gantry for
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
all electronic tolling
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
and also then tear down
 
01:45:36.639 --> 01:45:37.430 align:start position:0%
and also then tear down
the

01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.550 align:start position:0%
the
current

01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
bedford main mainline toll
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
am i correcting
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
the roughly equivalent
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
cost analysis
 
01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:52.310 align:start position:0%
cost analysis
commissioner

01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes we'd have to do some additional
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
borings and determine the exact location
 
01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:58.950 align:start position:0%
borings and determine the exact location
of

01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
the gantry should the plaza be relocated
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
but essentially yes from
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
we have to build a gantry
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
along the turnpike to replace the
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
existing toll plaza so we'll just be
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
moving it to a different location
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts of the committee on this
 
01:46:23.920 --> 01:46:27.350 align:start position:0%
thoughts of the committee on this
proposal

01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
i will i will remind everybody that two
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
years ago this was included in the house
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
version of the 10-year plan when it
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be going to the senate
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh but then it got uh
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
death by covid uh
 
01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.709 align:start position:0%
death by covid uh
so

01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:44.719 --> 01:46:46.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
it was not a new subject nor a new
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
matter that this committee has dealt
 
01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.149 align:start position:0%
matter that this committee has dealt
with

01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i move out to pass on
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative clutier has
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh moved that
 
01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
uh moved that
this

01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:06.070 align:start position:0%
this
uh

01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
zero two six one h be included in the
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee amendment on
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%

01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's been seconded by multiple people
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative edgar representative
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
mills among them
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%

representative newman
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i just want to
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
understand this would be
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
oh lord the north and south it would be
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
north then of exudate and south of the
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
current ten
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
i i
 
01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:47.830 align:start position:0%
i i
this

01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
kind of leaves it up to the commissioner
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
and her department to the physical
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
setting that it says within the vicinity
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
it could be a little north of it a
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
little south of it depending on land and
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
where the best possible
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
sighting of that would be i'm not trying
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
to specify what mile marker or
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
or what because that that gets into
 
01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
micromanaging um the engineering of the
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
whole thing which this committee has
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
never done
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
and so i would interpret this to be that
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
you want a toll plaza between
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
exit 8 and exit 11. you're not
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
the intent is to capture traffic from
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
exit 6 or sorry exit 10 upwards so we
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't put it before
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
exit 8 and we probably wouldn't put it
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
after exit 11 we would find the
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate location
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
within the vicinity of exit 10. and that
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the way i envisioned
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
it when we discussed it two years ago
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
and when i was looking at it again this
 
01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.030 align:start position:0%
and when i was looking at it again this
year

01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
not trying to hamstring the department
 
01:48:59.750 --> 01:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
on the exact location
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
but of course two years ago we were
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
still planning on having exit 10 as a
 
01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:04.709 align:start position:0%
still planning on having exit 10 as a
toll

01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
toll
 
01:49:04.719 --> 01:49:08.470 align:start position:0%
toll
raft

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
thank you the other nice thing about the
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
all electronic is it it takes a lot less
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot less footprint and
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
they're a lot cheaper to construct so
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
the citing
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
citing possibilities would be greater
 
01:49:21.910 --> 01:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
given that you just have to
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
find enough space to put the
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
put the post to put the gadgetry on
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm in support of this
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh it it had when i first moved to the
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
state there was a
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
there was a main line toll at exit 11
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
and uh that course is no longer there
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
but this is similar to where that would
 
01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:43.030 align:start position:0%
but this is similar to where that would
be

01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
and when i was growing up the effie
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
everett ended at what is now exit five
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
however lisa
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick procedural question i'm
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
puzzled by these two amendments being
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
introduced by exactly the same language
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're not the first the second one that
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
we pass replace them
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
um no at this point
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
with these are only straw polls
 
01:50:09.910 --> 01:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
if the committee approves both of them
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we've already approved what the
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner has requested be included
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
i take them over to um
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
legislative services they take all three
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
language and put them into the right
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
format so
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
there is only one amendment that comes
 
01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:27.510 align:start position:0%
there is only one amendment that comes
out

01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
at in the the final analysis
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
01:50:32.239 --> 01:50:33.990 align:start position:0%
on house bill
2022

01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
which is a committee report to the house
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
of representatives
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
all those in favor did we
 
01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:48.870 align:start position:0%
all those in favor did we
um

01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
ready for the vote thank you mr clerk um
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of the adopt of the
 
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.270 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of the adopt of the
inclusion

01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
inclusion
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
zero two six one h
 
01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:00.390 align:start position:0%
zero two six one h
into

01:51:00.390 --> 01:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
into
uh

01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh committee amendment on house bill
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
2022 signify by saying aye
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
posney the eyes have it and it will be
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
that is all
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
i ask that it be done today so that we
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
could do on a committee report
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
understanding that something may come up
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
next week
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
we still have an executive session
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled for that day
 
01:51:38.950 --> 01:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
i will tell the committee this
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
if you looked at the calendar on the
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
february 24th i have a continued
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill 2022
 
01:51:51.589 --> 01:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
that will stay in the calendar
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
i am going to expand that
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
to include the two bills that we have
 
01:51:58.629 --> 01:51:58.639 align:start position:0%
not exact both of which deal with
 
01:51:58.639 --> 01:52:00.310 align:start position:0%
not exact both of which deal with
laconia

01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
laconia
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
the sale of the laconia facility
 
01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:04.470 align:start position:0%
the sale of the laconia facility
um

01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
and we will do those on the 24th so that
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
everybody can plan on being here
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
rather than just
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
um well we'll catch him on the fly that
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
worked for the first few but it's not
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
working at the moment and i want to
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
finish everything by the end of the
 
01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:23.430 align:start position:0%
finish everything by the end of the
month

01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
so with that commissioner do you have
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
anything that
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
you want to say
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
as always i'd like to recap the action
 
01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
items for the department um
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
i think we just have the one request
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
from representative ebel to provide
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
the loss in revenue from removing the
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
three plazas in merrimack as well as the
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
cost of removal of those plazas and
 
01:52:52.960 --> 01:52:54.070 align:start position:0%
cost of removal of those plazas and
buildings

01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
and was there anything else that the
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
and representative we'll email you our
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
suggested language for
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
the amendments you can incorporate it
 
01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:10.390 align:start position:0%
the amendments you can incorporate it
into

01:53:10.390 --> 01:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
one format we just have the hard copy
 
01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
here but we can send you the electronics
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
now the the the hard copy is fine
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner because i i just take them
 
01:53:18.159 --> 01:53:19.189 align:start position:0%
commissioner because i i just take them
over

01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
and and uh
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
the very able people at legislative
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
services will take it all and put it
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
to the right language and no
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
numbering and not and all the rest
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
um so the only other action is to
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
continue working with hudson
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
what the scope of work would be so they
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
could bring forward their request at the
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
anything else if the committee wants to
 
01:53:54.159 --> 01:53:55.750 align:start position:0%
anything else if the committee wants to
discuss
